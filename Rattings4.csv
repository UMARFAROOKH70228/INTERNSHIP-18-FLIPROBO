1,"Very poor printing and scanning quality...Difficult to start , install and use...If you bought you can see this faults.."
1,"Hi, This printer was connected to my main system. Two other computers are connected to this main system. Initially I was able to give prints from my other systems, But suddenly one day, I was not able to Print  from my other systems. On contacting the HP support, they say, this printer does not work on a network....I wonder how it was printing since so many days? Thereafter I was unable to print Excel & PDF documents from my main system. This time I was told that the softwares ( PDF & Excel) would have a problem...My only take is if you  dont want a problem, then avoid this printer"

1,within a week its started getting issue
5,Best and most helpful item in printing and copying your document.After this item forget the expenses on cartridge so economical printing and you will enjoy printing after using it
3,Video Player is loading.
1,I am not able to get the software authenticated as license code is not sent along with the software CD
1,"Order for Microware scanner, but received a product for iScan scanner, While scanning,  products always giving ""RED"" light error indication. It's a Amazon fulfilled product. But not a quality product, Amazon not checking quality of the product. Just charging high for Amazon fulfillment. This a second time happened."
1,It's not good. Don't purchase. I will return.Scanning not properly. Only A4 size paper scanning ok . But  book page not suitable.Don't purchase
5,The machine has more RAM than comparable models. Hence it is able to print faster.The scan functionality is supported by a good software.It has a cover for the feed paper so that as to protect the paper in the tray against dust.The machine also turns on fast. I have used models from another popular brand and find hat this one performs much better.
5,I got this before 9 months i am using it form my small office business. Trust me this printer is perfect in every way. We take every day 3 to 4 copies. 8 to 10 prints and 3 to 4 scanning in a moths. very clears prints. i refilled 1 time
4,the printer is a bit heavyDoesn’t need much space to place the printerPrint quality relatively very goodFast printingEasy installationNeed to down the user software from canon websiteEasy onlyGot it a bang on deal for almost 10.7K
3,the profile on this page says that this printer is duplex (both side printing) but in reality I am unable to print both sided so could you either explain me right way or change the information already provided immediately
1,"It was a very bad experience faced with the Canon MF 3010 Printer. I could not able to print after my 64th Paper.Following are the issues I faced after that.1  Faded prints came for near 10 pages after that nothing is printed.2  After the advice, I tried to change the Toner Powder, No luck nothing is printing3  I have been asked to change the drum as well. But the service team is not confirming that even if I change the Drum.4  I have been asked to change the Catridge itself for the new printer.Asked Amazon Agent about the product and they are not ready to solve it."
1,I received it this way
5,I have the same model and using it for thirteen years without replacing any spares. Excellent printer from Canon. No paper pickup problems or paper jams. Please keep the printer protected from dust and other foreign small particles like used staple pins which if accidently get inside may cause paper jams. If paper gets stuck please follow instructions by the manufacturer to get it out the right way. Pulling the paper the wrong way may aggravate the problem. The paper pick up roller should be cleaned when necessary. Printers are electromechanical devices with sensors attached to perform the necessary functions. Dust and moisture are both enemies which may cause problems in the long run. So avoid them as much as possible. Careful occasional vacuuming and blowing will keep the printer in good condition. While changing the cartridge be careful. Do not do anything by force. The cartridge should gently glide in the rail without any obstruction. Recommend the seller as it was delivered on time and in perfectly packed and new condition. The price could be a little discounted.
3,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.
1,Damaged product
1,Its all you can aske for in a Monochrome Laserjet Printer. Simple to operate and good quality scan and print. Let us see how many copies the cartridge gives as it's shown as 'Starter'. Felt cheated in the deal though as the Output as r product description is shown as color. whereas it's a MONOCHROME printer. Didn't expect this from a Canon Dealer.
4,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."
3,Very difficult to install by searching different videos on YouTube. Still i couldn't do it. Not started using after trying a lot.
5,I have been using this printer for several years now and this is my second purchase. That should explain what I think about it.
4,Printer is good.. but is makes lot sound while printing.. .. 10 k is ok for this product.. for 12k it is waste
1,"No colour options, not suitable for my requirement, if I want to replace with other models which has colour options, Amazon says not possible. Waste of money."
5,"So far my experience product is good. Price is really low.It is useful for home & small office use. print quality excellent. Packaging is excellent , I expect more good products from Amazon.  transparent & hassle free service  .Also I will recommend for friends & relatives to buy product from Amazon"
5,"- Printer doesn't occupy much of space .- Prints Efficiently & prints are crisp & bold even in Toner Save Mode .- Start-up or warm-up time is less than 5 seconds .- Easy to setup like '' Plug & Play ''All features - Print , Copy & Scan work efficiently .However if Wireless Printing could be provided , it would be cherry on top .If you want to buy a affordable multi-function printer , this is a safe bet ."
3,Printing problem occurred after 6 month of very normal use... Print speed is fast but does not print properly.
5,Excellent for rapid mass monochrome printing.  Can stand considerable abuse and keeps working.
2,I purchased this printer and I recieved a defective product. The printer prints at a very light copies. Also I am not recieving the service for the same. #Pathetic Canon..
5,Hood
1,Installing problem
4,The printer is very good but if you are planning to make it wireless with your raspberry pi then you will run into issues. Canon ones aren't usually supported by CUPS printing service and its a night mare to try to setup.So take this if you are plannign to use a separate print server or as a standalone printer. Doesn't work with raspberry pi.
1,It seems that it doesn't support legal size
5,As expected the printer met with my requirement. Found user friendly and value for money.
5,Everything of the product is perfect but the courier takes too much time to deliver the product and the service support of canon at Bhopal is fabulous.
4,Nice
5,Good product
5,Good product
4,Only 100 pages print with and again refilled
1,Your deliveried printer is not working. Loss for money. This is very bad
5,Best in market in this price range
4,Print quality is very good but print quantity is not so much refill  it every 6 to 700 pages.
4,First class but wireless connection is not there
3,The printer we received within a span of one week itself we have to refill the cartridge and then its showing a drum problem that also we already replaced... The item is not meet our expectations....
5,Perfect home office printer; great deal from Amazon. Super performance; printed about 700 pages in one go and worked like a high end heavy duty document printers.
5,Good  Experience best quality print
1,It didnt work since the input of first pageThe very next page got jammedReally had a bad experience with it
5,"Printing , scanning quality all are top notch.The setup is easy build quality also is premium. Highly recommend."
4,Very good and useful.

3,"Average headset considering the price you pay.Pros: comfortable and ergonomic, light weight. Mic is sensitive.Cons: No dedicated mic or volume button (big disappointment), also the mic is not unidirectional. I'm used to the mic being on the left side of my face and this headset doesn't let you rotate the mouse to a full 180 degrees. Audio clarity is average, I attempted to play a few songs and also PC games and the sound is not at all immersive, a huge disappointment. The mic is too sensitive, now let me explain why this is a con - it picks up mouse click sound, fan breeze, almost everything. I had to fasten a sound dampner over the mic to fix this. Now Logitech should have provided this for free in the first place which they have not.Overall, I'd say don't pick this headset if you can shell out Rs 1,800 there are a lot more headsets you can choose from."
5,"I purchased this headset for conducting webinars from the comfort of my home. The product was delivered in good condition and on time by the Amazon personnel. I had purchased this headset after conducting thorough research upon it. I am glad to say that now I am able conduct my webinars without any glitch.  Attendees of my webinar have no issues with the sound quality of my webinar. This is a testimony of the fact that the mic of this headset is of high quality. Unfortunately, I do not use this headset to listen to music . Also, attendees of my webinar remain muted at all times. So I would not be able to comment upon the sound playback aspect of this headphone. But I have heard a few songs over this headphone and I found nothing wrong with the headphone in its playback aspect as well."
4,"The product that I received the first time was defective. The Mic was not working but Amazon replaced it, the replaced unit worked fine. I only bought this product due to its shape and it fits well over the turban but if you don't have that issue then Sennheiser PC 8 Over-Ear USB VOIP Headphone with Mic (Black) is a very good option. These logitech headphones does not have handy controller which is there in sennheiser headphones and the price is almost the same.The only thing I liked about these logitech earphones is that it has a very small mic and is not visible when you fold it inside. I have used Sennheiser headphones as well and the sound output is almost the same for both headphones."
4,"I will not get into saying that this is the best product out there, but simply that it works as expected.being 'on ear' head phones, the sound i hear is a bit lesser than my in ear head phones, but that's ok. sound quality is just fine. i am use this for my skype calls and hearing some online training videos and hence my needs in terms of sound quality are limited.i asked the person on other side about did he hear me better, but he said that it was the same. so not sure how good the noise cancellation is.the best part is USB connector. the other regular 2 pin headphones with mic, are becoming a problem, because most laptops these days come with single pin. i had to return my sennheiser headphone because it came with age old 2 pin option.this headphone is definitely worth the buy if you are really looking for a headphone for normal daily use."
1,"Use it for work. The whole reason I got it was that I had the same model 6 years back and was serving me good with MS SFB, teams and webex. But this one has a weird problem with MS teams - it always reduces mic volume. I need to pull the right earpiece out of my ear forward so that the mic is obnoxiously close to mouth if somebody has to hear me. Realized and confirmed the problem after the return period was over and I am stuck with this one. I tried all driver updates, settings in windows 10 - it is a problem with latest batches of this model probably - because the old one still works good in the same system when it works - that has developed loose contact over many years of use - that was the only reason to buy the new one."
1,"I am disappointed with this product, within 10 days if usage the left side of headset is nit working, and by that time the return period us over at amazon, please let me know how I could place a return and is there any warranty on this product"
1,ZERO noise cancellation. In fact it boosts background noise and brings it to the foreground. Thanks to it I could hear what my other employees were talking about while one of them was on call.Just out of the box it also looks damaged because there is a gap at the tip of the mic and it looks like something has been removed. There is no gap if you look at the original logitech product image.
5,I already have the H340 headset. I purchased the second one as a spare but using for the laptop now. I can't live without it. They are just amazing with nice bass and crystal clear sound. The people who are looking for over the ear headphones for long long hours must go for this. It feels as if you are not wearing anything. Very cozy. Sound quality is just awesome.
2,Ordered the product thinking that it will have volume control. But it does not have the same. Can not return it INR 2650 /- wasted as no return policy. Get back to your nearby shop if you want to have the option to return the product. That will also help buying what you really want.
4,I bought it and it was not working after 17days. Since it was not under return policy of Amazon. The customer service helped with warranty and it was able to get a new item from nearest Logitech center. Voice quality is nice but the it decreases after some use.
5,"I know reviews are personal opinion, but it did surprise me when couple of people give bad reviews - cause its an awesome headset for the price you are paying.I got a Sennheiser PC 8 (http://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-PC-Over-Ear-USB-Headphone/dp/B005HWEZGG/ref=pd_rhf_cr_s_qp_1_FXWK?ie=UTF8&refRID=0C1EE3FG0Q2GVK79KCH2)And in my opinion it was such a piece of crap in comparison to Logitech H340 Headset.The only problem or the headset's awesomeness - however you want to see it is that it's mic picks up every minute noise, including my friend's mouse clicks who is sitting considerable far from where I am.I highly recommend you guys go for it.To make the mic perform better what I did is wrap a piece of foam around the mic so that it doesn't create the swoosh sounds when you say something that ends with 's' (see the image attached).Over all awesome product - loved it.And Amazon's delivery has been on time and as usual delivered a great product."
4,"This product is amazing as it is comfortable and easy to use if you are working for long hours.  I have been using this headset for the past two months but to be honest this was a re-order and the previous one I had used for approx two years (had to replace because the headset cover got torn - the only minus). The audio quality is excellent and noise cancellation even though there, you can hear the surrounding environment if it is not a quiet one. The mic quality is also superb. The price is a bit on the high side but it's worth it if you look at its durability and I got it on time without delay and at a discounted price too thanks to Amazon Prime!!"
5,I bought this headset for my 7 year old son to wear it during online classes. It's perfect for small kids as it's lightweight and sits gently on his tender ears which makes it possible to wear for longer time. Though it's expensive but serves the purpose. I have also tested it for sound quality and it's very clear. I would highly recommend it.
3,After testing may bluetooth headphone i have ordered Logitech H340 headphone. Its very nice quality of product with sound and mic. ITS NOICE CANCEL ACTIVE headphone that good about this product.But there is two minus point about headphone- it does not have control over mic ( on / off  or volumn + / - )  inself.- its headphone grip over head can not be locked so it lose its grip while we move around.Overall its good product
1,"After paying a premium price, performance of this product is like 100 rs othe earphone..even far below..noise cancellation works in such a way..that it cancel my voice and otherwise person keep complaning ..please speak louder....after shouting..I got complains from otherwise..headphone antena..or voice handler..such a small..even voice does not reach to it..i feel bad after pusrchasing it and put it in junk"
1,"Product worked only for a day on freshly installed windows 10. As soon as there were some patch upgrades, it stopped working. Looks like it is not compatible with windows 10. I checked in 3 win 10 laptops but no luck.Product website and Microsoft forums also mention that this device does not work after Windows 10 upgrade. These compatibility related information must be put on the product description page else gradually customer will lose faith from Amazon's marketplace. Whether you accept this review or not its your choice, but let me assure you that this was the last electronic product I bought from Amazon."
5,Worth the price. Got it for 2k and outside it is 2.5 sow orth the money. I've dropped this for over a million times and yet lasted me for two solid years with high quality. This is my first purchase through amazon for this headset and they delivered right when I wanted it. Love it
5,"I've had fantastic luck with this headset so far. I've had this set for over a year now and I use it almost every day to teach over the internet. I have tried using it for more demanding voice recording and there is quite a bit of noise recorded as well so you might want to pick a higher-end model if you are pod casting or something of that nature, but it is perfect for chatting online or listening to music/movies/etc."
2,i had seinheiser headset USB for skype calls and for backup purpose bought this headset.  But sound is coming only one side from this side which is disappointment.  on the other hand sound is coming from both the sides on the sienheiser headset.  This headset looks good but not meeting the functionality and no controls on the headset to put mute and sound adjustments.  The sienheiser has that and also cost less than this headset.
5,"I have been using it almost 8 hours on all working days for last 8 months ! I am into training and consulting profession, so mike quality and noise cancellation is important.  The product is of great use and surely I recommend this to people who has to deliver training or conduct online reviews. Wire length is sufficient, so that I can stand and move little back while training so that I appear in video. Easy to use, just connect USB. Comfortable and no problem even though I wear for long hours.  Looks professional. As of now, I did not find any problems  it is working great for me."
5,"As the headphones don't have buttons to control volume like Plantronics, it don't support volume control. When coming to noise cancellation it no where differs with Office headphones (which costs 8k). Build quality is not much good, after few months of usage, the USB port which is plastic covered is fragile and may not lost longer. The head band is some what loose and the wire inside the band that is given for adherence is coming out of the band leading to band becoming very loose. Except build quality I rate 4/5"
1,Not a worthy product considering the price they are charging it will stop working in 2nd month of use.Me and my friend bought it and both of us are facing the same issue. It doesn’t work at all after 2-3 months. There is some serious issue with this product. I wonder is this covered under any warranty i want replacement?Freaking spent 2600 bucks on this. Totally disappointed.
4,"Absolutely no doubt about its sound quality. It does what it needs to do in terms of sound. But it does fit on your head and it keeps slipping, also a mute button is what min required from Logitech. Better to go for higher version if you can afford"
1,"This type of build is not expected from Logitech, this feel like a cheap product. headsetUSB connector is very weak and loose, wire of the headset is very thin and poor quality at this price.Noise cancellation works okay."
5,"Superior quality, durability. I have been using it for more than 4 years now. Fallen in love with it due to the build quality, design and usability. It lacks a  volume/mute control on the wire but I had troubles with other headset with those from various brand including logitech. I dont know if this model is available now in the market but I really recommend  this. Like it very much.!!"
3,"I bought it few months back and I think post 6 months of its usage, one day suddenly it’s mic had stopped working. I had tried many permutation and combination but it never worked. My usage was taking office call(teams, skype). I won’t recommend this product to buy."
1,The headset stopped working within a month. I thought it was only me but all my colleagues who bought this gave the same review. Don't go for it at all. Cheap quality product.
2,The sound quality etc are ok. But it has a massive problem with the mic noise continuously leaking into the earphones. I can constantly hear myself breathing through the earphones and it is immensely irritating and hurts the ears too.  I have to take this thing off the moment a meeting is over.
4,Delivery is super fast and product is good...noise cancellation is also okay.I am satisfied.
1,"This headphone is complete waste of money. Within weeks wire will come out of band. Mic stopped working after few month of use.I purchased for mainly receiving webex, skype meeting. Simply waste of money."
1,"Post I purchased the product it was working all fine for a month and after a month it completely stopped working. Initially, it was impressive and from day one the built quality for not so great. The plastic was of cheap quality and the ear cushioning was also of basic type."
5,I ordered the headset on saturday (ZINGA PUNGA) and was surprised to get it delivered by monday itself. Thanks to amazon as it Packed beautifully inside a logitech branded boxing.Easy to unpack and installs rightaway when plugged into an USB port in your desktop/laptop.Checked the functioning with skype and its brilliant without any issues.Audio is crisp with clear mids and highs but somewhat muffy low.Microphone is brilliant and could record even minute surrounding voices.
3,It's a good product. I am using since last 5 yrs. That's why ordered the exact same piece again. Awesome voice quality but lack of strength in the product. Logitech should pay some attention on the build quality of this product.
5,Good for the price. Satisfactory noice cancellation. I can hear the other person loud and clear. Mic works really well too. Build quality is on the cheaper side though and One needs to be very careful in handling the headset in order to prevent any damage.
5,"1. Better mic compare to H1512. Earphone sound quality is not as good as H1513. To be connected through USBFor online teaching and meetings this is a better option than H151, because of the better quality of mic."
1,"By seeing the specs, I felt that inside area of ear cups is complete cushion. But actually the product comes with two small paper like pieces of sponge which comes for a road side product.  I really don't understand what it means shown in the pic attached."
4,Purchased only because of noise cancellation mic to take office calls at home. Serving my purpose decently and the audience was able to notice the difference.
5,Purchased it keeping in mind the volume of calls I had to take at work. I needed something which ideally serves the purpose and not necessarily just a headphone. I use a MacBook hence it's USB enabled connection was seamless. Just plug and play
3,"Even though it's Pricey the Quality of sound is good. Does not have volume control.  The cushion are thin, could have been more thicker for a good cushion."
4,I bought it and it was not working after 17days. Since it was not under return policy of Amazon. The customer service helped with warranty and it was able to get a new item from nearest Logitech center. Voice quality is nice but the it decreases after some use.

1,"Post I purchased the product it was working all fine for a month and after a month it completely stopped working. Initially, it was impressive and from day one the built quality for not so great. The plastic was of cheap quality and the ear cushioning was also of basic type."
5,I ordered the headset on saturday (ZINGA PUNGA) and was surprised to get it delivered by monday itself. Thanks to amazon as it Packed beautifully inside a logitech branded boxing.Easy to unpack and installs rightaway when plugged into an USB port in your desktop/laptop.Checked the functioning with skype and its brilliant without any issues.Audio is crisp with clear mids and highs but somewhat muffy low.Microphone is brilliant and could record even minute surrounding voices.
3,It's a good product. I am using since last 5 yrs. That's why ordered the exact same piece again. Awesome voice quality but lack of strength in the product. Logitech should pay some attention on the build quality of this product.
5,Good for the price. Satisfactory noice cancellation. I can hear the other person loud and clear. Mic works really well too. Build quality is on the cheaper side though and One needs to be very careful in handling the headset in order to prevent any damage.
5,"1. Better mic compare to H1512. Earphone sound quality is not as good as H1513. To be connected through USBFor online teaching and meetings this is a better option than H151, because of the better quality of mic."
1,"By seeing the specs, I felt that inside area of ear cups is complete cushion. But actually the product comes with two small paper like pieces of sponge which comes for a road side product.  I really don't understand what it means shown in the pic attached."
4,Purchased only because of noise cancellation mic to take office calls at home. Serving my purpose decently and the audience was able to notice the difference.
5,Purchased it keeping in mind the volume of calls I had to take at work. I needed something which ideally serves the purpose and not necessarily just a headphone. I use a MacBook hence it's USB enabled connection was seamless. Just plug and play
3,"Even though it's Pricey the Quality of sound is good. Does not have volume control.  The cushion are thin, could have been more thicker for a good cushion."
4,I bought it and it was not working after 17days. Since it was not under return policy of Amazon. The customer service helped with warranty and it was able to get a new item from nearest Logitech center. Voice quality is nice but the it decreases after some use.
5,"I know reviews are personal opinion, but it did surprise me when couple of people give bad reviews - cause its an awesome headset for the price you are paying.I got a Sennheiser PC 8 (http://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-PC-Over-Ear-USB-Headphone/dp/B005HWEZGG/ref=pd_rhf_cr_s_qp_1_FXWK?ie=UTF8&refRID=0C1EE3FG0Q2GVK79KCH2)And in my opinion it was such a piece of crap in comparison to Logitech H340 Headset.The only problem or the headset's awesomeness - however you want to see it is that it's mic picks up every minute noise, including my friend's mouse clicks who is sitting considerable far from where I am.I highly recommend you guys go for it.To make the mic perform better what I did is wrap a piece of foam around the mic so that it doesn't create the swoosh sounds when you say something that ends with 's' (see the image attached).Over all awesome product - loved it.And Amazon's delivery has been on time and as usual delivered a great product."
4,"This product is amazing as it is comfortable and easy to use if you are working for long hours.  I have been using this headset for the past two months but to be honest this was a re-order and the previous one I had used for approx two years (had to replace because the headset cover got torn - the only minus). The audio quality is excellent and noise cancellation even though there, you can hear the surrounding environment if it is not a quiet one. The mic quality is also superb. The price is a bit on the high side but it's worth it if you look at its durability and I got it on time without delay and at a discounted price too thanks to Amazon Prime!!"
5,I bought this headset for my 7 year old son to wear it during online classes. It's perfect for small kids as it's lightweight and sits gently on his tender ears which makes it possible to wear for longer time. Though it's expensive but serves the purpose. I have also tested it for sound quality and it's very clear. I would highly recommend it.
3,After testing may bluetooth headphone i have ordered Logitech H340 headphone. Its very nice quality of product with sound and mic. ITS NOICE CANCEL ACTIVE headphone that good about this product.But there is two minus point about headphone- it does not have control over mic ( on / off  or volumn + / - )  inself.- its headphone grip over head can not be locked so it lose its grip while we move around.Overall its good product
1,"After paying a premium price, performance of this product is like 100 rs othe earphone..even far below..noise cancellation works in such a way..that it cancel my voice and otherwise person keep complaning ..please speak louder....after shouting..I got complains from otherwise..headphone antena..or voice handler..such a small..even voice does not reach to it..i feel bad after pusrchasing it and put it in junk"
1,"Product worked only for a day on freshly installed windows 10. As soon as there were some patch upgrades, it stopped working. Looks like it is not compatible with windows 10. I checked in 3 win 10 laptops but no luck.Product website and Microsoft forums also mention that this device does not work after Windows 10 upgrade. These compatibility related information must be put on the product description page else gradually customer will lose faith from Amazon's marketplace. Whether you accept this review or not its your choice, but let me assure you that this was the last electronic product I bought from Amazon."
5,Worth the price. Got it for 2k and outside it is 2.5 sow orth the money. I've dropped this for over a million times and yet lasted me for two solid years with high quality. This is my first purchase through amazon for this headset and they delivered right when I wanted it. Love it
5,"I've had fantastic luck with this headset so far. I've had this set for over a year now and I use it almost every day to teach over the internet. I have tried using it for more demanding voice recording and there is quite a bit of noise recorded as well so you might want to pick a higher-end model if you are pod casting or something of that nature, but it is perfect for chatting online or listening to music/movies/etc."
2,i had seinheiser headset USB for skype calls and for backup purpose bought this headset.  But sound is coming only one side from this side which is disappointment.  on the other hand sound is coming from both the sides on the sienheiser headset.  This headset looks good but not meeting the functionality and no controls on the headset to put mute and sound adjustments.  The sienheiser has that and also cost less than this headset.
5,"I have been using it almost 8 hours on all working days for last 8 months ! I am into training and consulting profession, so mike quality and noise cancellation is important.  The product is of great use and surely I recommend this to people who has to deliver training or conduct online reviews. Wire length is sufficient, so that I can stand and move little back while training so that I appear in video. Easy to use, just connect USB. Comfortable and no problem even though I wear for long hours.  Looks professional. As of now, I did not find any problems  it is working great for me."
5,"As the headphones don't have buttons to control volume like Plantronics, it don't support volume control. When coming to noise cancellation it no where differs with Office headphones (which costs 8k). Build quality is not much good, after few months of usage, the USB port which is plastic covered is fragile and may not lost longer. The head band is some what loose and the wire inside the band that is given for adherence is coming out of the band leading to band becoming very loose. Except build quality I rate 4/5"
1,Not a worthy product considering the price they are charging it will stop working in 2nd month of use.Me and my friend bought it and both of us are facing the same issue. It doesn’t work at all after 2-3 months. There is some serious issue with this product. I wonder is this covered under any warranty i want replacement?Freaking spent 2600 bucks on this. Totally disappointed.
4,"Absolutely no doubt about its sound quality. It does what it needs to do in terms of sound. But it does fit on your head and it keeps slipping, also a mute button is what min required from Logitech. Better to go for higher version if you can afford"
1,"This type of build is not expected from Logitech, this feel like a cheap product. headsetUSB connector is very weak and loose, wire of the headset is very thin and poor quality at this price.Noise cancellation works okay."
5,"Superior quality, durability. I have been using it for more than 4 years now. Fallen in love with it due to the build quality, design and usability. It lacks a  volume/mute control on the wire but I had troubles with other headset with those from various brand including logitech. I dont know if this model is available now in the market but I really recommend  this. Like it very much.!!"
3,"I bought it few months back and I think post 6 months of its usage, one day suddenly it’s mic had stopped working. I had tried many permutation and combination but it never worked. My usage was taking office call(teams, skype). I won’t recommend this product to buy."
1,The headset stopped working within a month. I thought it was only me but all my colleagues who bought this gave the same review. Don't go for it at all. Cheap quality product.
2,The sound quality etc are ok. But it has a massive problem with the mic noise continuously leaking into the earphones. I can constantly hear myself breathing through the earphones and it is immensely irritating and hurts the ears too.  I have to take this thing off the moment a meeting is over.
4,Delivery is super fast and product is good...noise cancellation is also okay.I am satisfied.

5,Very good product.colour print is bit costly..easy to use.easy to print from mobile app.good quality print .suitable for homes and print less than 70-100 pages in a month
5,It's a very good multi charging cable. Don't know if it's a fast charging cable but it charges fast if used with single device at a time.I definitely recommend this product.
5,"I have a lot of devices. And iPad Pro 11, iPhone 11 Pro and android phones so carrying different chargers for every phone is a real hassle. So I ordered this cable. I have tried It with all of my devices and it is working fine with all devices with different ports type. However when I tried charging three devices of different port types together, charging speed was too slow so I charged one device at one time and then it is working fine."
5,I got the wire to charge my iphone after being disappointed by so may others out there.. this one proved to be great! The 3 different charging extension helps me charge my phone and the power bank in one go and is overall very efficient. I just carry around this one charging wire for all my electronic needs! The wire charges fast and is a great asset for me
4,"I have 3 phones , 1 Has lightning port, 1 Has type C , 1 Has micro usb.This thing is really helpful to me as I have only 2 sockets in my hostel room and borrowing an extension from my friends isn’t always good. So this is the thing for me. Overall I think the packaging could have been better rest everything is fine.Update : It stopped working."
5,We cool nylon 3 in 1 cable is too good.  You can charge multiple devices at the same time. It charges very fast. And the headache of carrying multiple chargers with you when you are travelling is also solved as you you can charge your iPhone or any android phone with this. At this price it offers very good value for money
2,"The cable is built sturdy. It does not support fast charging.I bought it for fast-charging. Unfortunately, it doesn't fast charge."
1,It doesn't support Data. It is only charging cable. Didn't expect WeCool can provide wrong information....
5,"Its good in length, strong, and does fast charging in every type. I love  it because of its three type usage. My brother and i both charge and play phone simultaneously together. Loved it"
5,Nice quality product it’s very nice and handy. Wire quality is excellent it’s very flexible to bend in any position. It has 3 extensions which can be attached to any phones. I liked this product and very happy to buy this.
1,My note 10 plus is taking 4 hours to charge fully in this..worst cable ..dont buy.
1,The cable cannot be used in the car with Android Auo or Apple Car play. Buy only if you want to charge your devices and not have any data transfer over it.Unfortunately Amazon doesn’t let me return this even though it is not useful for me.
1,"I use this cable to charge 3 kind of device one at a time, cable help to charge device but it failed after 30days of using it. This cable dose not support data transfer for any kind of devicefrom outside quality looks good but internal connection with jack is fragileThere is warranty you can't claim as there is a underlining to register this cable in before 15 days of purchase."
1,"Very cheap quality product..didn’t last even for a week...I seriously thought it’ll be a great product as I can charge all my phone in 1 go but it really turned out to be a very cheap product.. yesterday while I was pull out the I phone jack from my phone , I was surprised to see the charging pin was broken & was stuck in my I phone charging point.. very disappointed with the quality of the product..not gonna buy any lead from Amazon in future , God knows if they are of same quality 😡😡😡😡"
1,"The product looks classy and compact. Cable that arrived was faulty. It works only if charging device is placed at specific angles. Got replacement but the new cable charges slow even with a single device. When you connect multiple devices simultaneously the adapter heats up and charges slow. This cable took 6 hours to charge a single device with 3000 mAh battery. The type C cable is a one side cable, it doesn't charge when connected with the blank side on top. Want to return it but they just have 10 days replacement option. Do not recommend it."
1,"Liked this 3 in 1 concept to save some money instead of buying multiple cables but finally incurred loss. I purchased this cable few weeks back. It says fast charging, but it's charging speed is less than normal speed. Not even able to charge 10% in an hour. I have used it hardly for 15 days. Waste of money."
1,"This cable is quite bad on all levels.It's USB-C  connector stopped charging within a few months of purchase. It cannot charge 2 or more devices simultaneously either. Braided cable is ok, but plastic covers on connectors broke off within 2-3 days of use. It is being sold for Rs 350, but the overall quality is same as cables sold for Rs 150 in roadside stalls.I had taken it on a long trip and had to buy new cables because it stopped working. Typical chinese low quality stuff."
1,"There doesn’t seem to be enough charging power travelling through this chord as It says it charges all three at the same time, i say the lightning cable doesn’t work at all!! I have tried in both of my iphones and it simply doesn’t charge!! Only micro usb cable works"
1,"The only thing fast about this order was the delivery, which reached me within 3 hours from ordering. The cable does not support fast charging. It's slower than regular charging without the dash adapter. False advertising.Cannot comment about the durability or strength yet. But expecting to be fully disappointed on those counts too."
2,"I purchased it for triple use with my OnePlus Nord (Type C USB), older Samsung Galaxy 7 (Micro USB and iPad.I found that the Type C pin is a little over-sized and would not connect. I tried it with another Samsung phone with Type C port and there also it would not connect.Obviously I did not use excesssive force to avoid damaage to the bult in female portion in the phone.  ( I have other Type C connectors and they  are mating smoothly). Howerver, other pins viz., microUSB and iP pins are OK. The nylon braiding and look are all fine.In short it didnt serve the purpose for which I bought it. Looks like there was no quality control or  it is a reject . Dont buy it if you are looking for use with Type C port device."
1,Worst product. Initially C and iPhone pin was working but not the normal usb pin. After few days only C type is working. iPhone pin and normal USB charging pin stopped working.Never go for these cheap and unreliable charging cables. Such type of third grade companies cheats the customers. Amazon should have some short of quality control over these third class products and sellers.
3,"1. The packet itself has no WeCool brand on it but just a sticker on it has the brand name ""WeCool"". It makes the product itself prone to be replaced with fake ones. Anyone can duplicate it with a fake sticker. So I clearly doubt the originality of the product in itself. The company should have given a box and sealed it with plastic wrap like the most genuine brand does.2. My Moto X4 phone charges normally in 45 minutes with a turbocharger, but using this cable plugged into the same Moto turbocharger takes appx 2 hours to charge it ( also if only 1 device is being charged ). In that way, I cannot say it's a Type C cable in itself. It adds more time to completely charge when 2 devices are plugged.3. To my expectations, the cable can save you when you need your drained-up phone in a while but not immediately.4. I hope our companies make better and efficient products and apply fair pricing, so they could compete in the global market."
1,Does not support fast charging for my Samsung device.No point of buying...hence I am returning my product
3,Amazon should take it updating the product description.This cable doesn't support fast charging.Cable durability and quality wise is good. But Its normal charging wire. Even data transfer is also not that fast.
5,"Best combo cable for charging usb mini, Type C and iPhone lightning connector.Tested with Zinq Technologies 2A Dual Port Mobile Charger.Charges iPhone 12 Max, IPad Air, Google nexus phone and other android devices very quickly.Cable quality is very good, sturdy. Length and connectors extension is proper. Very good option for table top charging setup for all devices .Definitely recommend"
1,"Was having high expectations. But the cable failed at multiple level.1. The charging ports and the USB are not easy to connect. Considerable pushing force needed. Afraid it might damage phones port/adaptor ports.2. As mentioned, tried with original adaptor. No fast charging. Tried with multiple phones and adaptors. Dint work. Infact i ordered 2 cables.Both didnt work."
1,"Overheating within 4 minutes os usageI replaced the adapter still the same issueWaste of moneyWaste of timeIt says Fast charging cable but when plugged to mobile it shows ""charging slowly"" all the phonesCan't Return as its not in the policySo replacement is the only optionPlease Please Never BuySheer waste of time and money"
2,"With this cable we can only charge mobile phones but we can't transfer our files to PC or any other devices.we can't use this cable for Android auto play in cars. Actually I ordered it for Android auto feature in car ,but this cable doesn't support this. extremelyDisappointed"
1,"The delivery package came in a small plastic bag, it looked strudy but with in two days the wire fixtures coming off . They seem to be just stuck around with bad glue . The wire parts around the charging point and usb point all have come off. Dont purchase , not worth the money.Not at all fast charging."
1,In 3 ports...type c port not workingRemaining two ports are ok..And most important thing..this is not a data cable as described....it is just a charging cable...Not useful to keep in Car for android auto..Not useful for Data transfer...Charging also not fast....Return is not available
1,"The cable wire is a 2nd replacement, however is not compatible for Iphone 6s Plus as against mentioned is the brief description of the product.We are obligated to either thrash away the cable wire or keep replacing it since it does not work even on MI Note 7 phone.  As a customer we don't have time to keep replacing things, should be accurate in the first go."
3,"It’s a nice cable and charges the phones. However as claimed in its photos that it can be used in cars etc, is not true. It does charge, but it does not sync with Apple CarPlay or any other syncing is not possible."
2,The product looks good and robust. Initial impression was very good. It could charge multiple devices simultaneously albeit slowly. It developed a loose connection internally and stopped working in about two months time. An absolute waste of money. Its better to spend more and invest in a better quality cable. Not recommended for purchase.
2,It was good at the start. However it started to malfunction in 3 months. Stopped charging consistently. No information on the invoice on how to get a warranty replacement. No reply from the seller either. Their one year warranty seems a farce.
2,"I've been using the product for 5 months now, primarily using the type C connector. Worked well all this while with no issues, but last month onwards the charging gets disconnected intermittently even with a slightest movement of the phone while on charging. Eventually works for some time after flipping the cable upside down. Definately not a long lasting cable. If you're looking for something which should last atleast an year, this cable is not for you."
2,"It doesn't support fast charging.Vivo v17 pro comes with dual engine fast charging feature which is not enabled when this cable is used. On the other hand, when the original vivo cable is connected, the dual engine fast charging gets enabled instantly.Perhaps this cable is not delivering as much current as required by the dual engine."
2,"Build quality seems to be ok but it's not at all fast charging cable, tested by all original fast charging adapter. It's just 2.0 Amp standard charging cable only. Don't waste your money. Better go with 2 different charging cable you'll get a better deal."
4,"The wire works as specified — I am able to connect USB C, micro USB and iPhone for charging.The charging speed is definitely high - even on slow charging adapters. The only drawback is that it does not function as a data cable. The PC does not pick up the connection when phone is connected, but it does charge well on PC USB as well. Maybe that's the give and take for such a design.I am also able to connect devices simultaneously for charging and it does charge simultaneously. Durably designed. It is sturdy."
3,"Received the product today (4/11/19) as committed. I tried charging my OnePlus phone. To my disappointment, it does not support fast charging as claimed (used OnePlus adapter)."
2,"The charging cord was charging good initially.. quality wise also it is nice. But later on it stopped charging. Also when one type of point is connected to phone for charging, we can feel leakage current in other point which are free. Overall bad experience and now it is useless for me."
2,"I have not noticed its a chinese product, else i would have not baught it.C type chrging pin does not work good.B type is working good. So purpose does not resolved to charge the power bank and mobile together"
4,"The printer was easy to install including the wireless settings and I was able to print over Wi-Fi. The catridge life was showing as 10% on the new printer which didn't sound right. So ordered another one (Thanks to Amazon Return policy) which got delivered and old one was picked. Installed all over again and went straight to check the catridge life and it shows 100% now. So make sure you check the catridge life and get it replacedpromptly. Other than that one issue, it seems to be working fine. Have tried both printing and copying. Quality is good."
5,Wish I could have purchased it earlier - I already purchased 4 deskjets/inkjets from last 10 yrs - but I don't know why they eat so much ink - I got tired of ordering its cateridges - Also my kids are in school (11yrs & 6 yrs) and they get something to get print out every second day and during exams - you can understand. This serves my black and white printouts (almost 90% of requirement) and I have HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4335) that serves colored printout (10% of requirement). the print quality and speed is great ! and energy save option is also cool - it remains on standby and whenever you need a printout from your phone or laptop - just give a command and in less than 30 secs you will have your printout :) Amazing. Hassle free. Very satisfied with the product and its features
3,Canon is not giving installation n demo serviceIt takes charges for demo n installationThat's not fair
5,"The product was delivered before time. Excellent printing and quality of the scanner is also pretty good. The machine is the latest in its class and wireless connectivity, printing from smart phone features are superb. All-in-one unit Canon i-SENSYS MF 232w is ideal machine for home. amazon.in has wide variety of products and fully satisfied with their services.Rajendra Joshi17/05/2017"
1,"This was my worst decission to buy a printer from amazon. The product which i received from amazon was a defective one. The box was wet and damaged also the print quality was not as expected so i requested a replace. The replaced product which i received was a 2nd hand product. No seal, broken plastic, used cartridges, all transparent papers removed, no driver cd, no user manual. Be cautious while getting this product as amazon has now started delivering used product."
5,I'm stisfied this has WiFi & usb interface. We can scan and print from mobile phone. No need to switch  on the computer. We can print direct via wi fi without a router connection.
1,There is no two sided printing it's major drawbackFor only office purpose not for commercial purposes
4,"Excellent quality output, i was looking all in one printer for small business with ethernet setup and this suits it. But still i see manufacturing date was 2019 and looks like old stock. Also the cartridge comes inbuilt has only 20% so you have to purchase additional cartridge. Overall product is good hope after sales service also good."
3,"Printer is good, however, getting its toner cartridge is a challenge. Canon website also not been of any help. I didn’t find their website providing option for purchasing original cartridges. Looks like this printer has to be scrapped due to non availability of original cartridges. Suggest avoid any Canon printers in India. Thanks"
5,I got this printer on 25 th August morning.  I called Canon service Center and requested for sending a person for installation.  They registered my request and on same day I got it installed from Service Center. There were no charges for installation.  Very professional service personnel.  Would recommend everyone to download Canon app register the product and call for service help.First day my rating is 5 star.
5,Decent printer with superb features like wifi features.....makes it's more convenient to be use it while placing it in any corner of room/house.Also one more thing first one have some issues Amazon as well as seller simply replace it and suggest replacement by their own means not unnecessary bothering me...So it's superb deal for me....10/10Printing quality is acceptable....Also many other features like printer screen advised every time if printing matter is outnof paper range...Printer-cum-Scanner also it's  upside...So it's highly recommended.....Canon's machine.....
5,Very good product from canon.This is not Chinese product. This made by south koria. And Japan based Company. It's Good think.Toner used 337.
4,Canon should send its person to install the new printer and sync it with our existing network systems.We had to unnecessarily pay extra Rs.1500.00 to our maintenance person.The cartridge given with printer had very short life of few days of normal printing of about 10-15 pages/day.
5,"Mass productIt does not support duplex printing.It is faster when we connect to ur computer or mobile wired or wireless.And we can make certain paper setting in the printer itself instead of doing it in ms word.There is a difficulty to setup a CD drive in computer,if u look and read the guide properly you will be able to setup .Thatsall"
1,"Print quality is horrible and the CANON customer service is poor. Raised a dispute one week before and still waiting for the response. Attached a print quality comparison for better understanding. Right side is printed using HP P1108 and left side is printed using Canon MF232w. While registering the complaint, I mentioned the quality difference. That time the customer service executive told that do not compare the print quality with other printers. I don't understand how could he say that while the output from Canon MF232w is not understandable."
1,Item is faulty and fake cartridge inside. The printer shows a counterfeit cartridge message and doesn't print a single page. Very disappointed with Amazon. Expected better.
4,It’s easy to set up and start using.  Print quality  and speed is as expected.  Spend some time exploring it properly.If the colour printer was cheaper I’d have bought it.
5,"I was little confused before I order this printer. There's so many options available claiming to be best but I chose to buy this printer. Entirely satisfied. It's fast, print quality is brilliant, cost of printing is low. Anyone without 0 technical knowledge can install it."
1,ये प्रोडक्ट काफी खराब है  कम्प्लेन करने पर इस प्रोडक्ट को लेने के 2 सरे दिन से ही सही वर्क नही कर रहा था कॉम्प्लेन करने पर इसे सर्विस सेंटर द्वारा ठीक न करते हुवेइसमें जेनेटिक प्रोब्लम बता कर बनाने से इनकार कर दिए ।कम्पनी अपनी जबाबदेही से मुकर रही है नही प्रोडक्ट बदल रहे है न ही बना रहे है । इस लिए इस प्रोडक्ट को लेने की सलाह नही देता हूं
4,good printer only issue is that it is not auto duplex printer . no slot for pen drive for scanning. as scanning can be done trough computer only
5,I took this printer and superb and nice features. Before buying this I had tried other printer very tough to install for both Mac and Windows 10. But this CANON Printer is superb easy to install for both Mac and Win

5,"SV600 is the best option if someone is looking to scan books.It can scan into different formats such as JPEG, PDF, searchable PDF, Word, Excel, and Power Point.The operating time can be shortened by turning on the “Automatic Page Turn Detection” or setting a time interval after which SV600 will automatically continue to scan.It scans anything from Business cards to A3 size document.If there are multiple documents placed simultaneously, it automatically crops and saves each of the documents separately."

2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensive🤬I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ₹10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects

1,"I made this purchase, to help me get digital jeevan praman, about a year ago. Please note, there is no mention of Radium Box in the description, but you get a reference, on a small slip of paper in the box. Approach them, and they will charge you extra for registration/authentication. You make the payment, and they confirm the registration, but the application won't find it, and they won't help you out. You feel like you've been duped. After all, if this was so necessary, it should have been declared before. And no helping hand.I approached Nitgen too, for independent drivers for possible non-government applications, but even they don't listen. I'm landed with a useless device, a coulple of thosands down the drain.So watch out ! before it's too late."
5,using it at canara bank. its wrking and supporting canara bank cbs flexcube login.
1,Bought for Jeevan Praman for my mother. Its RD service is not compatible with Aadhar and kept giving error messages. No response from technical support team also. Total waste of money.
3,Lot of Technical issues.
5,"I would say this is a much better card scanner than a photo scanner.  Since this is portable and the scanned photo / card / paper moves across the scanner parts, the possibility of scratches are higher, than on a flat bed scanner, where the photo / document to be scanned is kept stationary while the scanner moves.  Therefore, photos tend to get scratched easily, and that gets scanned as well.  Business cards, smaller documents such as small bills are different - and scanning them is easy, and reasonable with resolution.  Strong buy for those with offices where smaller bills need scanning as with cards.  The accompanying card OCR software is quite good."
2,Was amazed by the ease of use but dissapointed by the quality of scan translations. The software does not return a consistent output and data is not very accurately scanned sometimes.
5,Nice
5,Rally nice product and very easy to use. The accompanying software - Prestacko! BizCard 6 - for reading the data takes some knack to get you going though.. but still is very helpful.

5,"Model : L 3152Seller : Appario RetailPrice : ₹10350Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.Before setting this up please read  comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.Recap:1. Fill the ink2. Charge the ink3. Run nozzle test (1 page)4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)5. Setup WiFi5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store6. Start printing and scanning.Hit like if helpful.🙏🏼"
1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‘both light blink’ i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‘EPSON’ printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it’s a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‘Problem in EPSON’."
4,"I was looking for printer for printers 10 prints a day ...so i discussed with friends. All my friends said buy anyone Epson or HP all good but buy INTANK. Hence i read everything. For my case EPSON, BROTHER were coming to best. Hence my friend was using EPSON from 4 years ..so i blindly bought it.1. Printer speed is good2. Resolution for print is good3. Cost effective4. Works wireless via phone, win, mac laptops.5. Easy to use & installI think you can blindly buy it. Warranty is 30K pages or 1 year whatever comes first.Any queries let me know.All intank printers are good but depends on use case.If you use case is Printing pics etc more ..go for Canon or HP. ElseIf color printing is not only thing ...rest all parameters EPSON/ brother are good.Go through youtube video people explains is it well"
4,"Using this printer from last almost one year . I received it on time and nicely packed.  To connect, it is not very easy because there is no digital display.,But managed. Print quality is good but speed is slow, but for average home use it is good. To refill ink it is very easy. Although I haven't refill it since purchase as I print 20-25 pages average in a week.Right after one month of purchase it had some technical problem and it stopped working.  The scanner cum xerox part of machine was faulty which need to replaced.  But I must say epson customer service was  good . Within 24 hrs technician came to my home . Although to get the faulty part it took some time , but  Epson took care of it. Technician was good and he explained me everything . Since then no other problem till date . Its works perfectly well with phone or laptop,  android or apple."
5,"I got this to print few pages since we are all working from home now. Set up was super easy, just download the software from Epson website (they give a CD but who has a CD drive anymore?). Really have nothing to complain about.Pros -1. Connecting to WIFI was easy and the printer has stayed connected for over a week. No drop in signal.2. Wake up from sleep mode and to print was really quick, was able to print the first page in less than 5 sec from the time it woke up and started printing.3. Scanner is working good, no issue there.4. Refil was easy, the ink comes in a no-spill type bottle and there is no way you can mess the refill.5. Unlike HP and other printers which use a cartridge, this one uses ink tank. Hence you dont have to fill it up fully if you print very little and not worry about ink drying up.6. App is good. You can basically do anything from the app that you can do via computer.Cons -These are not really issue as they are what defines a low end ink tank printer, but something that can be a deal breaker for few.1. No ADF, it can hold some 10 paper at a time. We need to keep adding paper2. Scans via the glass, so cant scan many pages at one go.3. Original Epson inks are not always available on Amazon. HP seems to have their products much more often and always in qtd."
5,"Initial Comments - Needed a printer that could support both windows and Mac. This one fits the bill.Pretty smooth installation for Windows - picked up my home wifi router without any issue, and the printer's own wi fi works fine as wellInstallation on mac was a bit longer - for both Mac OS 10 and Mac OS 11 - the drivers are not pre installed. You need to go to the L3150 series page on epson website and download the driver. Once installed - it picks up the printer smoothly. In less than 30 minutes - i was able to print from 2 windows laptops, 2 Macs and 3 Android mobile phones.Epson iPrint app is fairly smooth on the mobile phone. You could choose the page layouts, number of pages, etc with simple swipes.Filling in the ink is easy enough, the ink bottles are spillproof.All in all - fairly utility printer, smooth installation, and importantly worked smooth across devices.Would get to know the longevity of ink and per page cost over the usage, and would update the review later."
4,"Best all in one printer, however the printing of photoes does appear to be a little bit of low in their quality comparitively to canon and the Gsm support could be higher,Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 minOtherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competitionThe print speed is takes around 25 second for one sheet on highest quality for B/WThus a good alrounder for home use, while i would not recommend for colour printing and mainly on higher gsm"
5,Bought printer during lockdown to print school related things. Did a lot of research to decide between ink tank and ink jet. That plus advise and feedback culminated in the purchase of the 3152. And it’s awesome!The set up was very easy. Of course I didn’t read the instructions carefully so it took me a bit more time but that’s my fault. Set up was fast otherwise. I have set up the WiFi printing - in fact we only use that. Everyone in the house including the  wife and kids have learnt how to print without an issue. Initially it looked like the blank ink was finishing really fast but doesn’t look like it.Keep in mind initial head allignment will use up ink bit thereafter it’s great.Not as great as a laser obviously. And I think ink jet quality is better. But for school etc this works very well. Ink jet would not last these many prints for sure.Have been using for around 40 odd days.  The usage has been heavy due to school so not sure how it survives low usage. Did have a minor challenge in registering warranty but a quick email to Epson sorted it in no time.
5,"I have no idea what these low rating reviews are talking about, may be they got some defective product which certainly was replacable..apart from that, the product is great..working perfectly fine..had hundreds of prints in first month and it has no issues regarding prints and scanning..Photo printing quality is also great..I mean I have used L805 model as well which has 6 ink colour tanks and this one with 4 colour tanks is no lesser than that in print quality, just the thing is, you got to know which paper to use..Yeah the build quality looks little loose or lighter, but hey, you don't have to carry it in your bag, it just restes on your table and keeps printing.."
4,"Value for money for an ink tank printer and can used for home and small office needs.The print quality is good and yield is decent too.However I found the print speed below my expectations. Of course I didn't expect it to give the print per minute speeds as claimed by the manufacturer, but printing large number of pages over wifi is a pain as it takes a lot of time.One needs patience for printing high number of pages over wifi or wifi-direct.Installation is neither difficult nor easy but one can do it by himself/herself too after following the directions provided.But the installation process can be made slightly more user-friendly."
1,1st : printing quality is not good as u think2nd : not easy to use3rd : head damage very early4th : you have to call a technician every month5th: ink tank Air bubling prolem6th: paper jam problem7th: Wifi connection problemI buy 2 printers but the same problem with both
2,"I don’t recommend buying this printer... u will not unit’s not as fast as advertised.. printer stops printing in between if you switch the application and there is no print queue. Print Quality is not that great... but the interface with MacBook and iPhone is seamless with this 3152 printer... HP ink tank 419 is way way better printer than this at same price though the printing is little slow, it is better in all other aspects. u can just give parallel prints and forget, it will print and keep ready but with Epson u can’t give prints parallel it says printer is busy no option of print queue !!!!"
5,"I bought this printer during the Republic Day Sale. I needed one for home printing which was cheap to operate and use. It was received in very good packing. After seeing a couple of YouTube videos and the attached instructions I was able to install it myself. It was a breeze doing it. Using the CD was able to install and configure the printer over the WiFi connection. I also installed the Epson imprint app on my Samsung M31 and it detected the printer immediately. Now, I am able to print from both devices easily. I took a photocopy first which came out fine. I then printed some photographs (attached) which are pretty decent (though not as bright as originals but not totally unexpected). I didn't try the scan but should work fine seeing the way photocopy worked.Looking forward to using it."
3,"The installation process is not at all simple. Me being the technical guy had so much difficulty setup this printer. I then had to connect this printer with USB cable to my PC. Unable to setup the wifi part of this printer. Cant setup in the mobile with wifi direct. Scanned one image and then printed it, the print out came very faded. I m still not sure what went wrong in the installation due to which the color print out came so pathetic."
1,"I have been using this printer for couple of months now. I have another brand single function printer too, the quality of documents printer from this is not at par with other brands. The printer stops prints abruptly inbetween a print operation and WiFi direct is not reliable. I contacted technical support who inturn assigned me a service engineer who was of no help to me. Printing B&W photos gives a blue tint or greenish tint and I have retorted to online printing for the same. Some of the photographs come out with poor dynamic range whereas my old printer could handle anything thrown at it. The software is sub par and looks like some cheapish Chinese alternative softwares and not one supplied by a professional printer manufacturer. If you just want to do casual printing with a mix of photographs it's fine, if you are looking to print on a day to day basis then look elsewhere!"
3,"Print quality good most of the times but sometimes pathetic with horizontal lines....Very difficult to set up Wireless connections both connecting it to wifi and using it through wifi direct.Epson being such a big brand has bugs in its software... Anyone installing the software can know the wifi password of the laptop as it is very visible right in front after the driver is installing....Also it was an uphill task to connect it on the wifi network...Epson needs to step up their game and make installation user friendly...Furthermore, android app lacks option to print desired particular pages.... In order to print 10 different pages we need to give 10 different commands... Or else we have to use the laptop to print 10 pages in one command...."
5,"I was looking for a reasonably priced printer for home use (kids projects, occasional letters, photocopies, scanning documents) and zeroed on this model after recommendation from some of my colleagues. After using this printer for more than a month I should say I am pretty satisfied with the printer's performance.Positives - seamless wireless printing, easy set-up/ installation, convenient options for printing (low/ high/ average quality prints)Cons- none as of now, except the absence of a sorter makes things bit cumbersome (single page scan/ photocopy at a time)"
4,"Connectivity is good. I could print from my mobile, Ipad and also from Laptop. Best part is even when you are not using that regularly, Printer performed well. After staying idle for 20 days, I directly printed some photos on Gloss paper. They looked fine. You just need to adjust some sharpness in the Printer App before taking photo print.Back and forth printing is manual here but it is ok. For a home printer, it has reached my expectations."
5,"Let's point out some pros and cons...Pros:1. Prints quite fast, at about 10-15 ipm (b&w), depending upon the contents of the pages.2. Scan quality is excellent, almost like a photocopy.3. Ink consumption is very low, printed over 3k pages so far in b&w, still 1/4th of the black ink is left.4. Prints sharp and vivid images, excellent for photo printing.5. Easy to refill ink tanks with spill-proof ink bottles.6. Mobile printing (wireless) is easy to connect and use, contains most of the features of desktop printing.Cons:1. Unlike laser printers, print quality for small fonts is not very good, pixels are observed on the edges of the latters if looked closely.2. After switched on takes some time to initialize, sometimes it's annoying when you are in a hurry.3. Not a very compact design, outer parts are not so tightly attached to the body.Final conclusion: In spite of a few drawbacks it's a very efficient and smart printer for home and commercial purposes. Suitable for heavy usage (over 1000 pages per month)."
5,"When self installing the printer - You have to Charge the Ink after filling. Step 11 of Section 2 "" Charging Ink"". To do this after powering on the printer for the first time (and the power button LED has stopped blinking -  you have to Press the Triangle button for 5 Sec - The Power LED will start blinking again - This blinking will continue for 10Min - You have to wait. At end of 10 Min the Power button will stop blinking.Do not  try test print option - i.e. Press Button 1, keeping it pressed Press Button 2. -  It does not work. & in the process of trying for Test Print, it will exhaust your ink w/o printing.The Installation guide states the self filling will stop when the ink level reaches the top bar in the tank.It does not stop, instead  it fills beyond the top bar beyond the transparent window of the tank.One gets anxious if the tank will overflow. That did not happen."
5,"Great printer, was very easy to setup earlier it takes some time around 10min but then works smoothly and also the WiFi is very easy to set up,you will get a print out of your password and you need to connect your phone with your printer using that password once its done your good to go ( sorry forgot to mention please install EPSON IPRINT in your phone then you can be able to print using the WiFi from your phone)"
5,"Even though I'm a technology literate, I chose to call the official Epson engineer to install the printer and they visited within 24 hours.Installation process was very smooth and print quality is good enough for a regular home user who needs a print here and there.Printer is easy to install, ink is enough for filling up the tanks well. WiFi is easy to connect and it a smooth ride to print from laptop or phones.I recommend using Epson I Print app for ease."
4,"Giving it a 4 star because it has driver issues while connected via USB in windows 10, sometimes device is not recognised ( Don't Know if its  windows problem or printer problem).1. You can see the printing quality from the above pictures (Printed on normal A4 paper, quality may improve on Glossy paper).2. Free installation done within 2 days.3. Scanner quality is awesome.4. Ink cost is low compared to other printers.Note :- I will update the review after 90 day use,about customer support and any other technical issues."
2,"Writing this after almost 10 months of usage.The printer has frequent connectivity issues - it gives a communication error and becomes offline. Logged a complaint a few months back and the service engineer fixed the problem with some firmware updates.Started facing the same issue again for the last few days. It does print after a few tries but the scan option is just not working.Tried logging a complaint with Epson today, but to my surprise, they don't have any details of my printer [purchase date, serial number etc] and informed me that its out of warranty [It has almost 2 more months of warranty as per the invoice date].I was asked to send a mail with invoice copy and other details for warranty updation, and now have to wait for them to update in their systems; with no commit on how long it will take.Really clumsy and unprofessional on their part.Would recommend to go for alternate options if you can. I personally have had very good experience with my HP desk jet before.On the plus side, the print quality is good in B/W and acceptable in colour. The one big advantage is the lower cost of printing which comes with the ink Tank option."
3,"This is a decent printer that with a poor interface and buggy software especially for Mac users. The app is also not very good and in fact I regretted changing to this printer.The primary reason for changing was to have cheaper printing due to ink tank technology and that part works well.Here are some issues1. No duplex printing for Mac and manual for Windows2. Poor software that’s not intuitive3. If pages get over in between a print, the command has to be given again as it forgets the remaining pages.4. No screen in the printer so connecting to WiFi etc take some efforts.Not recommendedPM"
5,"From my two months usage experience,Pros: Easy to install and setup. WiFi direct and thru existing WiFi network options are available. Also you can print on the go from your mobile(ios&android). Easy to fill ink tank. Fast printing and decent quality output.Con: Build quality, paper feeder and output trays are very flimsy though solves the purpose without any issues."
3,"Delivery from Amazon was prompt.Installing the printer is breeze. The information pamphlet provides the steps to be followed and it took around 15-20 minutes to complete it. Configured WIFI-Direct option and have been using it with the Epson iPrint app. The quality of printout looks decent. Tried both colour and monochrome. Copy function is working well too. Have not tried the scan option and printing photos.To the not so good part, the build quality is simply plastic nothing much to mention here.And, they have mentioned that any non-genuine or non-epson ink may cause damages which is not covered by Epson warranties."
2,"Unable to get a print out copy. Unable to get the test page print. Thin plastic sheets compartments, afraid they will easily break  Old hp printer designed much betterbut 802print cartridges too expensive And hp personnel interfering with hp printer over internet."
1,"Rating 1 start because of their unprofessional customer support and low-quality product which didn't work for 10-12 months.I would say you can buy EPSON, only if you know how to repair printers. Else the EPSON customer support will give you hard time and also ask for advance payment into some unknown individual account to get it fixed. BETTER NOT TO BUY EPSON Printers."
5,"Fantastic printer for home use with online classes going on.A few features that I find mentionable:1. Super compact, fits even into a small area easily2. Print quality for regular prints is great3. Cost wise very reasonable to buy and also print on ongoing basis4. Wifi and WiFi direct makes it very easy to print from any device from anywhere in the house5. Yet to print photos on photo paper so don't know how that would come out. But printing photos on regular paper came out okayish"
4,Bought this printer after a lot of research...Pro:1. Wireless2. Good Print Quality3. Economical on Ink (Ink tank)Con:1. The WIFI configuration is time-consuming2. Some ink spill from the bottle (not the Printer)3. Scanner scans only A4 ...size upto legal would have been better.
4,Product received was nicely packed and received on time. I couldn't install or operate the system because delivered product was not working and required to call technical support team. Thank God they attended my phone call and solved the major problem by replacing its motherboard.I highly suggest that please never try to purchase this item through online. Please always purchase after proper checking from authorized dealers onlySamrom Lugun
2,"My name is SudhakarEpson 3152 printer is very good but very poor quality. Most of the ink is wasted after the printer is initially turned on. Also many times it takes more time to print. The printer I bought recently has a lot of errors. The first of which. Printhead Problem All the lines in the print are coming out. That does not mean that all printers are laid out. Sometimes it can even happen by transport. In any case, I think it's much better to buy on Amazon. The problem can be solved very easily in a very short time."
1,"Even after 2 hours of installation, doesn't print a single page.There is no such thing as customer satisfaction once you buy it, they will run with your money like thieves.Just dont buy, it doesnt print anything and Amazon or Epson won't take it back even if you call them within 3 hours of delivery."
1,I would like to point out following major issues experienced by me.1.0 I received the invoice without GST number being business invoice. Could not get any help through customer care as there was no direct number to reach the executive. It was all through auto voice and helpless. Please send an invoice to my email ID with the GST number given2.0 The printing quality is very pathetic. Kindly provide the direct customer care help line to redress the technical issue.
5,"First thing I checked is where is it manufactured, glad to find it is made in Phillipines. Setup was simple, some YouTube videos helped. Print quality is good and printer is simple to use. The application downloaded on mobile works like a charm via Wi-Fi. It is very light weight, and build quality could had been better. Found plastic flaps delicate and need to be handled carefully."
4,Best products
3,Not good
5,I have used this scanner for 7 years. I recommend this for libraries who have more files to digitise to create a digital library.
2,Only 500 prints and ink level has reached half.Fake promising of 5k prints
1,Fast time hp said that no of print 5000But actually it's print 1000 so costing is high.
2,You are really chiting campany in hp printers 5k no printer500 page in one toner very badAnd very cast one page
1,"It worked fine for around 2 months. After it has printed around 500 pages, the toner level showed half and the prints started coming out very faded. I thought perhaps we should refill the toner. So I bought the genuine toner refill from HP website  and refilled the toner. Instantly the ink level showed 100%. But the print quality remained the same.I called HP support and after 45 minutes of call, the engineer said that the print head seems to be a problem and an engineer will visit me.I waited for 8 days, no one showed up. I called HP support again, they said contact TVS Electronics in Jayanagar, Bangalore. I tried calling them at least 200 times.. on various of their phone numbers listed on HP website and google. No use.I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!I wasted 20K on this printer, just because I trusted the HP brand. Another printer service centre ( who doesnt service HP Neverstop ) told me that this is a bad printer .. most people have print quality issues with this printer."
1,"Printer is not giving 5k print. Don't buy this. Nearly 500 pages comes out which add cost of ink too much in later stage. I believed in Hp promise but its fake. Within 1 month , i have filled 4 times. 500 pages per 1 fill.. Don't buy this."
1,"False claim of 5k prints,but in reality only 300-500 prints.Toner is also very expensive."
5,"Looks like a cute mini photo state machine.Need Windows 10 minimum for Desktop Computer. You must have a router and a Wi-Fi dongle in USB of Desktop. If you have Router then It is good else Windows 10 can start Hot spot with wifi dongle. You can buy dongle from near mobile store or from Amazon. An active internet Connection is compulsary to install setup files. Little bit network technical knowledge is needed.Just type web url for desktop and scan QR code from mobile camera. Link and QR code are printed with books received with the box.This printer can work as photocopier, scanner and printer. Only black and white.Extra cartridge not found but one cartridge within printer with full ink found.Value for money."
2,false promises of 5000 pages only 2500 pages print.this printer is good in quality and system but company claims first purchase 5000 page print. But printer print 2500 pages.
1,I purchased HP Neverstop laser jet MFP Printer - which NEVER WORKSand there is the POOREST SERVICEIf HP wants - I can donate it to them free - Its unused - they can fool someone else tooShekhar Patil -70 year old - have lots of experience with printers in my life9820212303
5,"I have been using the product since month.It is genuine, brand new and good quality printing.Very simple to start with wireless access in this price range which is very accomodaing."
5,Nice product 👌👍
1,Horrible...... only one page is print and need to restart for printing every page...
5,Best multi purpose scanner printer.I am using hp printers for 20 years now.Now hp is in less plastic movement so this printer do not need to change whole cartridge. I can just refill it. Original refill pack is so much affordable now.I bought this printer for my office last year. And now bought it again for my second branch office.
2,this printer is good in quality and system but some ink problem one tonner can't print 800pages
1,Ink refil pump missing and CD driver
1,"This is very worst product from the manufacturer of H.P.  I never seen this type of bad functionality.  From day 1 it created problem.  Print quality and functionality is worst.  I request every customer not to chose this product.  All expectations were collapsed.  Seller not accepted to return back even requested immediately after purchase.  HP Company never provided any technical service.  I lost Rs.18,000/- for purchase of this printer.  Print quality is too much bad.  Seller advised to contact HP customer care, but Company of H.P. never responded to provide customer service.  This is very very very very bad and worst product of HP.  My rating is 0 star to this product"
4,"Taking print-out from android phone was flawless and very convinient. Establishment of wifi connection between phone and printer is very smooth. No specific app is required for printing from android phone. I have used Samsung J7 & Samsung A7 for this.But it was very difficult for me to install HP software in my Lenovo laptop having OS Windows 7 ultimate-64 bit via USB cable. Not a single software downloaded from official HP site viz Install Easy, Full Web Version, Version for- IT person only was successful. Later it was automatically installed by Windows update. No customer care mentioned in the documents are correct. I have received no call from HP regarding the setup/ installation of the item."
3,"This printer arrived with a leaky drum. What's more, the page count seems to be 24 more than actual (either zero not set correctly or used before shipping). The drum eventually got replaced through HP customer service, but getting through to HP and getting decent help online was a frustrating experience. So well over a month after purchase (of which the delay from my end was about 10 days) the printer is now set up and functional. And satisfactory so far. The ID printing option is convenient.Two disadvantages:1 The paper tray cover is very difficult to put in place and is really really irritating2 it does not print legal size (contrary to what the HP customer service told me on the phone). There is a range given for paper size but essentially you will be using only A4."
1,"I DONT LIKE THIS PRINTER SCANNER, THE PRINTER IS GOOD BUT SCAN QUALITY IS VERY POOR. AND IMAGES ARE CROPPING IN ONE SIDE. MEAN FULL IMAGE IS NOT SCANNING. I AM GOING TO BACK THIS PRODUCT."
5,"Good printer. Works well out of the box. I had some issue with wifi as my router didn't have a wps button. I was able to setup wifi printing by connecting to the printer using usb. Prints are good. If you don't need color, this is certainly a great printer. Able to print well using phone and windows laptop."
3,"Pros:PrintingSeamless setupCheaper refill costCons :It’s missing Ethernet ,Lacks auto duplex printing (not claimed, but still saying to clear if someone have doubt),comparatively weak WiFiPoor picture printing (might be due to wrong type...but not that great )Google cloud printing support is going away in Dec 2020"
2,"I don't have issue with the product only that I think I received a used product, as I'm trying to register for warranty but it's says already registered 4months  back ago. And the toner indicator shows already half have been used."
4,Very safely amazon delivered the product to my home... relieved my apprehension.
5,"If you are buying this with cloud print in mind google is removing its support for google cloud print for windows after December 31, 2020. Check google cloud print for an alternate solution. If u have apple products you can use air print with this.Other than this if you want to print directly with wifi direct it works flawlessly."
5,"It is almost an year now since I purchased. For people looking for black and white prints with reasonable good quality and affordable price, this is the printer I recommend."
1,"I am sorry to say that I am unable to use to this product due to there is no driver in the packet. As per written life-let I have to download it from Hp support, the website provided by HP for solution and supporting. I have tried so many time but even fruitless I am at the present. I need help to set up this printer in my desktop to use it.Thanking you."

3,After refilling with original HP toner the printout is not good at all once it is refilled.
4,"It was said that back to back printing possible,but only manual possible.Anyway it is possible to print back to back.Black cartridge is not available in the HP store"
1,Printer is not good and so customer support.I complaint about bad printing 4 lines are printing at horizontal layout . Not solved until now
1,"The product has decent print quality, but as with every HP product in the market, refills of toner and cartridge are not available. Please buy printers where you can get a refill easily."

5,"This is truly the best All-in-One monochrome laser printer in the market. I've been using a laser printer for almost 6 years now. Earlier my printer was Canon MF3010 with which I wasn't satisfied at all as the print quality was very light and after a couple of print, the colour got even lighter. Also, the refilling cost was around ₹700-800, so after using that printer for many years I was looking for another great printer for my home office. This time I needed a printer which has network printing capability, duplex printing, Google Cloud Printing and low maintenance/colour cost. Initially, I thought I would get an HP printer but none of them had all the features I was looking for and I will never buy Canon again in my life.So, after researching a lot I came across this Brother DCP-B7535DW printer which had everything that I needed. So, I started checking out reviews and finally decided to buy it. I bought it from my local Brother Distributer at ₹16,400/- whereas on Amazon it is being priced at ₹19,792/-. In fact, I also checked the price of this printer during Prime Day sale and the price was the same. Hence, I bought it from my local Brother distributor from way cheaper price than Amazon or any other online store.Here are some TL;DR for the printer:Pros:1. The printer has a super high printing speed.2. Print quality is truly amazing3. Cost of toner is about ₹650/- (Local Brother Distributor Price) which is cheaper than refilling while using the genuine product4. Cost of the drum is around ₹1450/- (local distributor price) which you only need to change after 15,000 page  print5. The LCD is backlit, so you can see it in a dark environment too.6. ADF is quite accurate and fast as well.7. Print, scan, copy all are super fast. I scanned a page at 1200 dpi which took 15 sec to complete. Amazing.8. Supports Google Cloud Print, which I'm enjoying a lot9. Network Printing works flawlessly.10. Printer shows ink low reminder when needed11. All the software & firmware are always up to date. Brother do provide software support and update their drivers, firmware and software, which you can easily update using the Brother software. Even HP, Canon doesn't do that.12. Also, did I say that the print quality is mind-blowing, it is even better than inkjet and local xerox machines.13. Superfast duplex printing.14. Build quality is very good.Cons:Found nothing so far. If I do find any, will definitely update my review here.I can definitely say that this is the best printer I have used in my life. The upfront payment maybe a little high, but the features you are getting and the amazing printing quality along with low toner cost, trust me, in the long run, you will benefit from it. Also as this is a lazer printer even if you don't print daily, your ink won't stop working."
3,"This product is good and we'll but this one cartridge no fillings , it's buy new cartridge every time it's 1000 or 3000 rs"
5,"Love this printer. Its got all functionalities for auto scanning with the automatic document feeder, duplex printing. Wifi support. Most other companies with all these features are way expensive.I faced lot of issues on Wifi connectivity, where in between large document scanning through ADF, it will suddenly stop in between.A different printer model from Brother, an user (all credit to that person) had suggested these steps. Please do the same and it will work perfectly over WifiInstall the latest firmware on the printer by downloading from Brother siteDo these steps on the printerFirst setup your Wifi using the set up wizard under Menu->Network->WLANThena) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Staticb) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.c) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.Now the printer will always stay connected to the wifi."
5,"It has auto 2-sided printing, which is a real paper saver."
2,"My machine was purchased in February 2021 and it has been just 4 months.During this time, I have printed our ~19,000 copies.All the while I have only ever purchased toner from official sources.I've already spent on purchasing 2 drums even though one drum is supposed to have the life of ~ 12,000 copies.Today the machine stops working and upon contacting the support centre (Again) I'm being told that my machine's ""guided machine life is over""How can a company be manufacturing machines whose 'guided life' is less than half a year and under 20K copies?The whole experience with owning a ""Brother"" printer has been an expensive and frustrating one.I can't believe I am saying this - however, I genuinely miss my old HP LaserJet 1030 which served me for over 7 years and through hundreds of thousands of copies. Even though using HP had its own share of issues, it was definitely CHEAPER!"
4,"Duplex printing works one in three times. The paper keeps jamming. Almost impossible to take multiple duplex print.Besides that, the printer's other function, print quality works well."
1,घटिया प्रोडक्ट और उस से भी ज्यादा घटिया सर्विस सेंटर की सर्विस 3 महीने में ही खराब हो गया और उसे आउट ऑफ वारंटी कर दिया। brother कंपनी का कोई भी प्रोडक्ट नहीं खरीदो तो अच्छा है  terms and condition apply  आपको सर्विस नहीं मिलेगी। फ्रेंड्स आफ्टर सेल्स सर्विस इस से गंदी नहीं देखी rs20000 में ऐसा लगता है आग लगा दी। डुप्लेक्स प्रिंटिंग में पेपर जैम अक्सर होगा। कंपनी 33 पैसे की कॉस्टिंग कहती है जो कि 90 पैसे से भी ज्यादा की पड़ती है। प्रिंट लाइट आता है। 1400-1500 प्रिंट  टोनर से निकलेंगे मात्र। adf scanner problem  में भी आपको टोनर का बिल देना होगा। ज्यादा प्रिंट निकल गए अगर आप से तो भी आउट ऑफ वारंटी। हर बार आपको नई टोनर ही परचेस करना होगा  वो भी gst bill के साथ जो कि rs1000 का आएगा बाकी आप समझदार है। आपका दोस्त
1,Am not able to get it to print from window 10 64bit os although it prints from my android phone please help
5,"Nice printer, printing quality is good , its print both side of paper one by one fast."
5,"Overall A+ category product. Fine quality prints. Wifi working great, easily printable with mobile also. Easy to use. Easy sync with mobile as Laptop. ADF working flawlessly. ID card printing is hassle free. Scanning shows true colors, no issues at all.But, Amazon delivery was super pathetic. They took extra 14 days to deliver after being dispatched. Amazon's delivery system needs some real quick fixes."
5,"This one rocks. For almost 18 years, I was stuck with DeskJet printers with their slow printing speeds and high cost of cartridges but finally decided to go for laser printer and was recommended Brother printer by my sister. Initially I was hesitant because we were so used to buying HP or Canon printers but I went by the reviews and I must say that it was a great decision.Set up is quite easy and in case there is difficulty in understanding the written instructions, one can find you tube videos on how to install. It's very easy and straightforward.Contrary to some reviews, I had no difficulties in setting up the wifi connection to my laptop. Simply insert the CD-ROM and follow the online instructions.Printing is butter smooth and very silent. Printing speed is also fine. The print quality is actually quite good compared to a DeskJet. Scanning and photocopy are very straightforward using online apps.There is another Brother printer model which is quite popular but this one is the latest 2018 model. I am not sure of other models like HP, Canon etc but they are costly and don't provide all features.Just go for it and you won't regret."
5,"I've researched a lot about all-in-one laser printers and I don't regret my choice. The printer is well built and print quality is quite good. Haven't got a chance to measure the toner life yet, since I am a light user. Seems ideal for occasional use, especially after my bad experience with my last HP inkjet printer, which used to dry up the ink cartridge very fast and eventually, corrupted the head. Didn't bother to get it repaired (which would result in me shelling out nearly Rs.800 for just the black cartridge apart from service charges). At this price, I can buy a toner to get 1000 pages output and need not worry about ink drying up!"
1,I brought this product starting it was working good but when I took 200 xerox offer that toner is not working even warranty services also not responding
1,Do not buy this printer. It has many problems. It always shows replace Toner codes. Original toner is very costly. It does not accept compatible toner. This a great problem.
2,Product is good but printing from mobile app is not good because it take too much time to connect and also many time it shows failed.
3,"Had expected a very good product from Brother, therefore, I decided to change my loyalty from HP to Brother. However, it does not live upto expectation. Machine frequently goes into Offline mode and everytime, have to lodge complain to correct the mistake. Also it is very slow to respond, once print command is given. HP was definitely better machine."
5,Very good product and Value for money printer.. but latest feature that is '2 in 1 ID copy' function is present in that machine but it works vertically aligned (that is top and bottom not side by side). Nowadays most of the ID copy is horizontal(side by side) which is actually required for most of the works. So I want a Software update that changes this alignment to horizontal(side by side). One more thing is that in this printer (DCP-B7535DW) we do not use 'ENLARGE/REDUCE and PAGE LAYOUT' function simultaneously. Which is a very useful feature for 'ID COPY' on 1 side of the page (Horizontally Align/side by side align). I request BROTHER TEAM to add at least one feature from these two via software update to ease of using this printer. Thank You.
5,Writing this review after using printer for 1 month1.Good Photocopy speed and scanning (quite slow if you need more depth image)2. Print faint you have to adjust copy setting at text then you get good quality print3. Toner is non refillable you have to buy new one. IF YOU ARE MASTER you can refill it4. Only upto Legal page is scanable in printer5. you can scan A4 directly but for Legal you have to scan with ADF (as small size of scaner).6. You cant photocopy legal size register or binded bunch
4,"I purchase this printer on August Month, working so fine.My Favourite thing in this printer is Wireless,we can directly print and scan via mobile with the help of application (Iprint&scan from play store) without router or modem.Duplex print working fine.Adf scan working fine.Purchased this Printer for only 18,000 from local authorized dealer with one year warranty.I will review about cartridge and refill when I will replace or refill."
5,"Excellent packaging, good courier service, and an excellent printer. It does duplex printing, without making noise, print fast enough, good quality print, and accepts print command through wifi-direct, Bluetooth, and also connects to a wifi network or LAN. All in all, it is an incredible product.I use it for my office, and also print study worksheets, materials for my kids."
3,Copier performance is very low even after keeping high-density there is no clarity on the Xerox copy. I hope they improve the performance at least in the next generation
3,Its good value for money. Only concern is scan via ADF is having line and not able to fix it. Good for light home office work. All in one printer simple go fo it. I am liking it better than other brands.
4,Best printer if your usage is less and you don't want INK-Tank printers. It got all the ticks right as per my requirement and cartridge is very very cheap (800/- on official brothers site). Better go for it. You will not regret. Got it for 18999/- on offer and may be that's why it was shipped almost after 15 days of ordering. Product was received in very sturdy packing.Register your warranty on brother website after purchase. Upload everythign and they will register your product.
5,I like the double sided printing that saves papers and I can also use legal size paper and A4 size paper via automatic feed and manual feed.Toner can be saved as well by using conservative mode.
4,I am surprised why duplex scanning not possible though ADF is available? This I have seen in the then Amazon Advertisement. Bulky printer.
4,"when toner low is on the screen, i change the powder and set the printer. then i see replce the toner on the screen . then i search the youtube fot the problem...  and procees. then again and again replace the toner is come o the screen... what i do?  i purchaes the printer on november 2019... and got it at 20th november 2019..."
1,"इस  प्रिंटर मेरे पास आया 10 दिन ज्यादा समय हो गया, मैने सपोर्ट brother par डिवाइस को रजिस्टर भी किया और मेल भी लिखा परंतु अब तक सहायता नही की गई मुझे इसे install, software download , scean, print, wifi connection pc, and mobaile  में दिक्कत आ रही  हैइस प्रिंटर को सिर्फ फ़ोटो कॉफी का इस्तमाल कर रहा हु  इसलिए मेरा मानना है की नए  ग्राहक के लिए यह समस्या आ सकती हैं  brother company को इंस्टॉल एवं गाइड करना चाहिए"
4,"Amazing printer, u can print both sides, fast printing but if u are looking for fast print and scan then don't go for this one. 4 stars only because it takes ages in scanning in comparison to big office printers coz I have a habit of those n didn't think it would take 10times more time. Even 5 times would have been fine."
5,"Brilliant machine which delivers what it says. Special mention for 2 side printing, fast A4 scanning & ID copy... Love the machine"
5,Amazing 1 day delivery by Amazon - lightening speed. Delightful printer performance. Exceeded expectations. Buying after using 2 well known market brands. Wifi connection so easy. Just marvellous overall experience.
1,This printer can perform heavy task very easily but it is not capable to perform very basic task.There is a lot of improvement required. After 6 months of usage I don't think that I can suggest it to any
3,Prints very slowly.  Prints at the most 12 pages per minute.  No way this can print more than that even with blank papers.
5,Quick and easy software driver install and easy to connect to Wifi by just entering SSID and pwd. After that the printer was autodetected on Apple Airprint and on windows laptops. Super simple.Multiple scan options - easy to use feed tray for scanning/copying multiple sheets.Only small negative if at all: it installs 3+ apps on the desktop which are not really needed since print/scan etc work directly in-context.
5,Delivery was hassle free. Packaging was appropriate. Installation was easy and manuals were very helpful. Print quality is good. Scanning is also fast.But it has no double side scanning through auto matic feeder. So that's the disadvantage. Otherwise this printer works fine.
5,Using for house. Professional quality prints. Duplex print inbuilt.First time it came without drum but Amazon replaced the product without much trouble.
5,Very good printer and Xerox
1,"This product is mot able to connect with WIFI, Customer care said we are not manufacturing updated product it can't be connected with 5 giga hertz connection which is provided by maximum internet provider. Customer care is also worst. Don't buy this product at all."
5,Works as expected. Easy to use with Windows/Mac and Android - tested all over WiFi. At this price range (18.5k via Appario Retail) looks to be the best Multifunction Laser Printer with WiFi and ADF support.
4,"This is my 2nd printer. It's a beast with some wireless connectivity issues. You won't Complaint about print quality ,speed. For first week I had this jamming issue but it was eventually gone with the use.Go for this! It's good buy."
5,"Best printer. It has all the features for an office purpose.Better quality print, have networking, wifi direct, faster print speeds."
1,OCR software not included. Requires license key.
2,"I was attempting to copy some pages of a book, and it has a serious flaw in it.  On the bottom, on one side along the edge, it has a set of wheels, and these seems to start and end the scanning process instead of letting you start and end the scanning process manually.  This means that the end of the scan cuts off the bottom of the image, and it is way too short for one to go across the page fully unless you want to spend 5 minutes stitching two images together, which I do not have time for, because it's thousands of them."
5,Good products

5,Got this awesome keyboard at at a price of ₹299. Keyboard has good grip at bottom. Smooth keys. Good height adjustable stand. Recommending all to buy this keyboard.
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better.
4,"Product is good, exactly as shown in the images. But the only thing I am surprised with is Amazon is now selling items without a GST bill. So, neither have i received any GST invoice with the product nor it is available to download from the order page. This is weird being the fact is that the GST invoice is the warranty card for this. Amazon must look into this matter.Uodate:- The GST invoice was available for download after two days of delivery."
1,I made the mistake of buying 2 Keyboards believing in Brand HP! Huge mistake.It is the most TERRIBLE Product.The Keys get stuck. Some keys behave erratically on its own.My money is wasted. But do yourself a favour. And stay away.
3,"Bought it on 24 Feb 2020, and the keyboard overall is nice with addition of just the volume control and no unnecessary buttons. However within 2 months i have a malfunctioning key - the letter 'b' is typed only sometimes. My usage is not much, still it has malfunctioned so early. Return period was within 7 or 10 days - no i'm stuck with it now. Will need to buy some other new one soon."
4,Review after usage of 1 week:1.Simple minimalistic keyboard2.Good for typing3.I use this keyboard for coding and development works.No complaints till now.4.Connects to and disconnects from laptop within second.Smooth and fast connectivity.
4,"The product is very good for the price range but there are a few minor quirks that I would like to point out for a specific kind of buyer.1.  The typeface printed on the keys are quite thin. If you are moving from using other keyboards with a more visible letters on the keys than you will have some time adjusting to the new keyboard, especially under low light condition.2. The body has mild flex in the mid section, although it is much better than the one you would find in Logitech K120.3. The keys are quite soft and silent, easy on the fingers, but lacks that tactile feedback you would normally find in other keyboards from bran such as Lenovo."
5,"There's nothing to take away from this guy. I am using it with macos and the scroll lock, pause, home keys are automatically used for some mac shortcuts. F11 takes you to desktop. And the dedicated sound buttons are just life savers. The build at places is a little too glossy for me, but overall it's been an absolutely perfect purchase.P.S. Typing noob so can't compare with typing experience. Gaming noob so... You get it! Just an average keyer who liked what he got!"
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient."
4,"If anyone thinks that it is the same keyboard as one gets with the HP PCs or AIOs then you are wrong. I typing this review with the above keyboard itself. The keys are nice and travel is as usual. But, when one compares with the keyboards provided with the HP PCs and AIOs, then it is not that sturdy and heavy. The keys are very soft and free as it is a new one and i am pretty sure it is not a heavy duty one. It is not heavy and strong. OK product. The quality wise it is giving me the same feeling which i have with frontech or intex cheap keyboard. For office uses it is a sure NO and for home [WFH] purpose it is ok. Will update more as the time goes with it using."
4,"What's important for keyboard is to make a consistent key layout. Many manufacturers these days ignore such fundamental design principles, and this keyboard is no exception. I chose this keyboard for avoiding a specific odd placement of inverted 'Enter' key. This keyboard has a straightforward Enter key, but oh boy. The PrintScr/Scroll Lock/Pause-Break buttons are lifted off from their original row of function keys, down one step. This is done to accommodate a ridiculous set of volume control buttons which rarely anyone uses. This further pushed the Insert/Home/Page Up keys one row down.Now, I need to get adjusted to this new odd behavior. Every now and then I screenshot my desktop, when I've to 'Insert' something. Nothing happens when I think I'm banging on Page Up (but Pause/Break is at that position).Do these multimedia gimmicks on maybe so called flashy multimedia keyboards please, spare the professional versions."
1,Some keys are inoperative. Didn't expect this from hp brand. Very disappointed! There's no option for return. Only replacement.. have requested for replacement. Will update the review after receiving the new keyboard.
2,Better look for any other alternative brand since HP is neither offering options such as entry level priced keyboard and premium one nor willing to improve despite of many people giving feedback about hard keys.  Such arrogance is not permitted in today's time when there is no dearth of options.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"I choose this keyboard and it was perfect for what I needed... Typing feels good and crisp, product quality is decent as well...It works great..highly recommended..*I don't play games on this keyboard,so I don't know if it would be good for gaming or not.."
3,"Cheap price and quality. This was only branded cheaper option for wired keyboards. Works perfectly fine. Keys dont get stuck while typing.Quality of plastic is average and the keyboard raiser at the back are extremely flimsy. One broke after 3 months.Most of the other wireless keyboards are way costlier than this, so this gets the job done."
2,I bought this in Feb of 2021 and it worked erfectly (key not working) for a month or so and then started showing wear and tear. Many keys on the keyboard don't work anymore. This is the kind of roducts we are getting nowadays. They hardly last a few months.
1,Purchased in June 2020 and and the space bar is not working (first week of Sep). Did not last even 3 months.  Tried to fix the membrane by opening the key. Did not help. VERY POOR QUALITY. HP website does not even recognize the product (tried with Product number and Serial number)
5,"I was so tired while searching for keyboard for my 17”laptop,  finally I went with simple thought to try this keyboard and surprisingly it is compact and well suited for my laptop.And I highly recommend as it is simple and cost effective."
5,"I ordered this for work from home, this is similar to the keyboard that I used at office. Works as expected, characters are clearly visible and decent click action. It has no back light and not recommended for gaming. Overall  it is worthy for work from home."
1,"Very bad..hardly used to for two weeks and almost all the keys have become hard.  I want to return but return period is over . I would definitely suggest people not to buy this. Waste of money. Was using Logitech for 4 years, no issues.  This keyboard lasted hardly two weeks.. a big no if you ask me."
5,"I needed a keyboard for the purpose of typing so I picked this keyboard. The design and quality is delectable. It has got volume keys. Feels strong and sturdy, smooth to type. My papa made a blue cloth cover for the keyboard to avoid the dust issue."
1,.....this away in a week as I spilt some beer on this by accident. I shook off all the moisture and dried it for hours in the sun for four or five days before discarding it. Buy spill- proof keyboards.
1,For this price range we can buy a non-branded keyboard which can compete the quality of this keyboard. Keys are not premium for this price range. Even though the grip is fine the keys are very wobbly. I'm a keyboard enthusiast and a fan of HP. My expectations for this keyboard is very minimal according to this price range but HP failed to give a quality product which deserved for this money! :( going to buy another keyboard now... what a waste of money!
4,"The keyboard is decent for its price. I had a Lenovo keyboard which was terrible to type with. The keys are very sticky and difficult to type with. However the HP keyboard is far better. For those who are looking for a keyboard for office kind of work, with low budget, I would recommend this.I cannot comment on the longevity of the product at this stage."
3,The product is good. I opened the box two days after receiving it as I did not have have time and was going out of town when it arrived. Once I opened it two days later I found the USB connecter in bad shape. It was pinched. I was tired after my trip and since it was already two days. I tried to correct the shape of that metal housing of the connector and still using it like that with usb hub. I don't want the post on my laptop to get damaged cause of it. I suggest check the product first for damages upon arrival
5,It works smoothly. I haven't faced any problems with it so far. The keys are smooth and with the right pressure. They are neither hard nor soft. Only a light touch is needed to make it work.
1,It is China Product....Someone put comment that it is an Indian and I bought it
2,"The product got delivered on 27th October 2020. The HP USB Keyboard does not get ""recognized"" by my laptop. I also bought an HP USB Mouse along with it and the mouse works perfectly fine. All my other USB cords, Pen drives also work well.I tried troubleshooting and other methods. It worked for one day, but the next day onwards the same problem reoccured and it still persists.I tried connecting the keyboard using all of USB ports on my laptop but it failed anyway.It would be great if I can exchange, if not return, the product.Thank you."
3,The keys are very clunky so not useful for gaming at all or even fast typing. Build quality is okay. Good enough for normal users.
3,The space key was defective (see pic) when I received.Have ordered replacement as there is no return.Also the height adjuster has only 2 settings. It cant go further which is drawback. I wanted to raise the keyboard higher.Keys are ok but a bit smaller than on my lenovo laptop. If you have big hands dont buy this please.
3,"Bought it for my work desk setup.PROS:-The keyboard looks premium and build feels good.-Keys are soft to touch and the response is quick as well.-The key travel is also good.CONS:-The edges of the keys are too sharp and was a bit comfortable while we land our fingers on the edges.-For a mac user, the keys felt small, so we tend to press on wrong keysIf you are comfortable with keys being a bit small and want to have mechanical keyboard type feel with less or no noice then you can consider buying this."
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
5,"The product is very light in weight. All keys are very smooth and makes typing easy.I am using it in both my desktop computer and laptop computer. When I received this keyboard I was surprised to see it's good material and nice looking.The keyboard has three hot keys and usb pin for connecting to pc.hot keys are volume up, volume down and mute volume. Keyboard also works with otg supported Android phone.I have tested it with yureka plus(Android 10)."
4,Yup Value for money good. Writing this review after 2 months of purchase .Some times i feel the keys are a but far like the H key is a bit hard to reach and i type g a lot not sure if my problem or the keyboards.. But overal the keyboards syill fine and kicking  .Go for it .
5,Brought this product and have been using it for a month now. Very happy with it. The keys and the ergonomics and the usability is really good and worth the money. The delivery was also super quick. I would say that this keyboard is perfectly suited for hard and soft typers alike. The wire length is also good and overall I am really happy with the product.
4,I bought this for INR 616 since my old keyboard had stopped working. I am satisfied with it and seems to be ok. All keys are working and the keyboard has decent ergonomics
5,"This is very easy to type and properly spaces keyboard with good response from keys. Great to type on, great for office use. Good for gaming too"
4,"Its a plastic so it's very light but the longevity is something that can be... low, for me, so far, it's been good.Yes it is mechanical keyboard, but don't expect the clicky noise to be what you want, it's plastic body so... it sounds okay.For it's price range, it's really good. Even though it's Plastic, it doesn't feel like it will break very soon.Its an okay product.Gaming-  sorry I don't game on pc so I don't know..."
3,"It's OK, but expected more better plastic quality. The keys are a bit bouncy and find it but difficult to type quickly. Ok for average use but for more professional daily use I would prefer mechanical than membrane keyboard."
1,The product looks genuine but a group of keys are not functioning!Customer care number provided by Amazon customer care is also not correct
5,"Under 300 rupees, this is best you can get.pros:full size keyboarddecently smooth keysless noise while typingrupee key presentinclined hinges for comfortable typingCons:wire length enough but less compared to other keyboardsno multimedia keys"
5,"Very good keyboard. Build quality is pretty good. Also has a good egronomical design and is sleek too. Keys are not too flat and at the same time not too bulky as well. Has a soft touch key press action that makes typing comfortable and smooth. Only drawback is that it does not have the LED light indicators for caps lock,  scroll lock and num lock and also no rubber bushes under the keyboard to prevent it from moving while typing. Otherwise this is a really good product for the price that it's being offered on amazon."
4,"Value for money product! Keys are not so soft, but good to work with it! As mentioned its splash proof but at the right top corner where 3 LED lights are placed for notifications of Alphabet lock, number lock and scroll lock there you can see a small gap in which there are more chances of water getting in and spoil the keyboard! However considering the price point it is the best in this segment! Go for it! Carbon fiber texture gives a extra premium look! Good to go!"
2,"The keyboard is very lightweight, however, it does not have the rubber grips at the base. So, the frictionless plastic bottom (raised 2cm² of it) against hard wood surface.. makes it a very annoying formula.It's flimsy, non-standard layout - minor issues that user could live with.. but this keyboard grip being skipped is horrendous choice at manufacturer's part. Then again, it's made in China and you can't explain any QA/QC at this price point."
1,This is the most bad product in the world. 😠.Just waste my money. Now I have to buy a key board again. The key are totally not working properly. I have to press it again and again but sometimes it types more then one latter or something it types nothing I hate it. Do not buy it at all. 😠😠. Amazon please review it and sell atleast that product which is working properly.
1,"Dont buy, even in 100 rupees it is costlier, cheap plastic material."
5,"Pros:1. Quite economical (also because am only using till lockdown... hence the keyboard looks as if will work good till next 7-8 months for sure).2. Good keyboard i.e.,, the keyboard material, keys, and nearly all keys are present.3. Light-weight.Cons:1. The keys make noise.2. Function key not present.3. No LED lights for caps or NUM lock keys.4. Looks like minor issue with Ctrl key, you need to press it twice/thrice to get it back to working.5. Key with radio sign (wifi/airplane mode) not present.But for this price range cons SHOULD be ignored.I've another keyboard from another seller for Rs. 700-750, but after 1 year of usage, it's letters print has started to fade n keys make noise... doesn't looks like worth the money."
2,Did not work as expected. Repeat rate could not be set and it always prints too many characters for each key press. Hence could not type.Returned for exchange. Can confirm its quality after the replacement.
1,"Used/discarded product sent, keys are jammed, full of dust, and non functional.  Package was of Quantum but product of Intex. Is Amazon now resorting such lower means to earn money? Sending any rubbish to customers after charging money......shocking"
5,The keyboard is soft and tactile like a very high quality keyboard. At the same time it completely justifies the quality it provides.Dont see much difference between this and the Dell keyboard I use at office.Great deal for the money you pay.
1,13th may delivered.. it was working fine for 10days..later started giving prob..if I press any key it is taking 2 times... If I press q it is taking qq.. not worth!Now 10days over and I cant return also.Go for Logitech.. expensive but worth!!!
2,"As soon as a month of usage, the keys started to become mushy and a single press triggers multiple entries and makes my typing experience very bad. literally, almost all the markings of the alphabets in the keys are gone for e now in just a month. don't buy if you can save extra 200 money to buy a keyboard. this is ok if you don't have more money to buy."
5,Very very light weight and it moves up m down when you when you start typing.  You will feel to exchange it however just within an hour or so of usage you will get accustomed to this keyboard and start appreciating it for the money it comes for. No problem whatsoever
2,I am writing after using for 2 months.. keyboard is not working..it used to connect to pc but not it's not working with the same PC.. I used it for only one pc..
1,Worst product I ever bought till now from Amazon  keyboard didn't meet my expectations and most importantly the reason for 1 start is is the poor quality of keybord ..while using keyboard it used to disconnect on own and then reconnect again in 3-4 seconds and the keys I pressed in between this used to get spammed and it disturbs a lot cause then u have to cut everything and write again and if u play games then if the key doesn't get response then there is just no use of keybord ...worst experience .. disappointed by quantum and from not I'll never buy quantum product I'll rather but zebronics it's 10 times better working than quantum 😤
5,"Nice keyboard,,, but I suggest you to buy by watching the palm rest keyboard,, to which you can type much easier...This keyboard is less palm rest space while continuously typing your hand will tired.. I watched later after ordering this, else I'll also go for that keyboard which has much space for palm rest,,,,Overall very nice keyboard,, I typed by taking the rest of table for palm"
4,"For under Rs. 500, this keyboard is well-built and of good quality. The keys are working fine. One downside is that it lacks those rubber stoppers on the bottom which causes it to slip and move around while typing. Otherwise, a very good product!"
2,"Low quality in cheap price.  Light weight and not in sync with surface are the drawbacks. While typing fast, keyboard seems dancing. Keyboard is elevated from the surface. Need to put more pressure on wrist n fingers while typing. Get a better one may be costlier if you are looking for a comfortable keyboard, or go with this if money matters."
3,Don't know id this is the case of mine only or overall but mine sometimes just doesn't work or the pc cannot read it while booting up and i would have to re-plug several times indifferent ports on my Gigabyte B450M DS3H motherboard which is very much annoying and frustrating at the same time.Rest it is a good keyboard for normal usage no problem whatsoever to date from October 2020.
1,Received damaged at bottom right corner. Build Quality is visibly not good. Don't buy.
2,"Poor quality. Its been 2 months, 7 letters already lost their prints. Many others are loosing theirs. I dont know what happened to the UV coating they applied. After a while half of the keys lose their prints. You are left to wonder what letter is where..."
5,"Right Shift key stuck all of the time, I thought it is manufacturing defect so I replaced but I noticed the same problem in replaced keyboard too. I think with this series keyboard design Engineer did blunder mistake while designing. Poor Keyboard please don't waste your money."
5,"The keyboard has been functioning perfectly from the very beginning till now/ I am sorry to say the previous one was defective. that is the a thing of the past, so let it be. Thanks ."
3,I was just looking for a temporary cheap solution. So bought this one. Though the Cable was broken and had to put electric tape. But keyboard works and delivered before time so I give 3/5. Will keep it and won't return.
4,"Very good keyboard, for basic use. Keys are spacious and soft touch. I am giving 4 stars since the packaging was not good and the corner of the keyboard is broken although it didn't affect the functionality"
2,Product seems ok at the price range but packaging of product was not satisfactory. It arrived with tampered state and with no extra care to prevent damage. Package was also not wrapped in Amazon box. I feel seller takes order for granted.
1,"It's the worst  keyboard I have ever used .Just after few days of light use , the keys become very hard and it's not usable now.My advise :Don't buy this keyboard at all."
5,Always I am very happy to Amazon and it's sellers. The product is excellent and it's works smoothly. The wire is something thin but it is well as this price. I strongly recommend to this product to bye.Lastly thank you Amazon and it's seller to provide me good product.
1,Some of the keys do not work unless the device is plugged out and back in. it is a Chinese product. :(
4,It is in working condition. The USB connection works fine. It did not take much effort to connect it and start using it.Reason for 4 stars: It looked a little old as if it has been used before.
3,"The keyboard looks and feels very flimsy. The design is also not super ergonomic. I went for a cheap one, should not have. Not very user friendly."
3,Good at this price of 300 .....but not good for tying as other keys got pressed while typing.....instead one should buy zebronic 500 rupees keyboard which has spaces between keys
3,"Product was lightweight and very thin, can't be used for long term, can be used as temporary, not value for money...😒😒...product packaging was good..and fast delivery.."
1,The product stopped working after 3 days of minim use and it is neither value for money nor it has appropiate quality. I wish to return it as soon as possible!
1,Got spoiled within 2 weeks of purchase. and even after having warranty the vendor does not respond
1,"the keyboard is malfunction  2, or more than 2 characters are coming on1 single keypress. some key need to press very hard, some key is showing multiple characters on a single keypress. I didn't check the keyboard on receiving the order, I bought it for the backup keyboard but when I try to use it it is not working"
1,Keyboard was broken from outside.very cheap quality spend 100 or 200 more but go for good quality products keys are getting stucked automatically while pressing them don't go for it guyssss
4,"It’s ok. Can’t say too good quality or compare to other brands, but it’s ok if you don’t want to spend more."
3,"So I ordered this one on 18th Aug 21 and today is 17th Sep 21. As you can see in the picture posted, the alphabets print is clearing out. Though the look and feel is good, but i guess the attractive low price of the product is taken down by it quality."
4,"Pros :1.Small in size , handy .2.Easy to carry , Overall quality(3.5/5)Cons :1.Buttons are tough ( Will become smooth after long usage hours ).2.Usb port is rough to use"
4,"It's very light weight keyboard and not for professional. The beginner can use this for their small work. The keys are not smooth. Wire length is sufficient for use.The seller send it with no packaging, it delivered with its original box. I get this ₹315."
5,Button pressed easily
1,"As I Unboxed This ZEB-KM2100, I Found That It Is Made of Plastic That Is Not Durable. A Small Force Applied At Its Ends  Tends It To Bend. Strong Force Is Sure To Break It.Okay, I Understand That I Should Not Expect Durability For The Price I Paid - ₹290.Its Keys Are Soft. It Is Light Weighted. It Worked Fine For 10 Days. 11 Day, Its 'Soft Keys' Became So Delicate That On Single Keypress, It Types Same Letter Twice (As Shown).Don't Buy It Seeing Its Price, You'll Be Disappointed. Go For Other Reputed Companies Like Dell.If You Doubt My Review (Including Screen Capture), Ignore And Go Ahead Buying It - Happy Buying :)"
1,Received broken keyboard
1,The keys stop working and don't respond for few minutes. For 5-6 days the keyboard worked very well... But now i m facing such problems. Unsatisfied with this product 🙁🙁😠
5,"Review after 1.5 months, this keyboard is awesome, because you can use a new keyboard at such low price, although i bet it wouldn't last more than 6 months of rugged use, but it will run fine till 6-8 months of rugged use, mine came broken (just a little bit of corner), so did everyone else get a broken keyboard nonetheless it's great, it's a great substitute for those ₹600 dell keyboards which are sturdy(if you can't afford one like me). This keyboard will easily last more than one year on normal use. It's extremely lightweight, compact. Smells like all those other cheap Chinese toys and gadgets do from inside when it's new, the keys are flimsy and after few months of usage you would have to press extremely hard on the keys for it to work. The keys are of extremely cheap quality kept in a socket, but works great, no locking mechanism but keys won't fall off. Overall an excellent keyboard replacement. Works for me I don't know if it works for others or not, don't expect fast inputs from this keyboard, this keyboard even takes about few seconds to connect, so not for gaming obviously."
5,"I am a regular user and I loved it!Reasons:1. The major reason to love this product is it makes no noise! It's quiet. I do not like that 'khat-khat' noise when typing. I am an extremely fast typer and the noise would have become unbearble if it made any! Thank god for that! I was looking for exactly this kind of keyboard.2. The overall size is not too small, neither too big! It is just perfect for personal use.3. I am not a gamer but I hope to use the multimedia keys for watching movies etc. If you are buying this for regular use at uome or as a substitute for your laptop keypad, go for it!"
1,The worst product I have ever seen on amazon. Keyboard was broken at corner. Worst keyboard. I had never written a bad review like this any time before.
1,"Budget keyboard with iPhone 6 features.Offers more than expected.Backspace key works only on 'very hard' press, and other keys work only on 'hard press'.Soft Press is like child-lock. No matter which key you press, nothing happens. Tap the beats of your favorite song while staying assured that not a thing will get typed(except 'L'). You could record the sound of key-presses and play it to get a typewriter effect.The 'L' key has feather touch... You type one 'L' once and you get two extra 'L' printed, absolutely free.The spacebar key has a nice upward slope as you slide your finger from left to right end.Compact, budget friendly. The kind you would find in Cyber Cafe.Guess what, its the ""Zindagi ke sath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi"" kind... As you CAN NOT RETURN it.Got it 30mins ago, just realized it has a replace-only warranty.Ordered it for WFH, but it turned out to be utter crap.Keys are so densely packed, and they don't work unless you put in an extra effort.It would be a steal deal for people who do all the typing with one finger only.Rs. 350/- wasted.... Willing to sell it off on OLX in 100rs.@Seller: you may take it back for free and sell it again to someone who might need it.#Peace"
3,Pros+Lowest price.+Full function wired keyboard for personal computer and laptops+ Zebranics brand produces good products at affordable prices.Cons15% smaller than a regular keyboard. Space between keys is less.So I face a little bit of discomfort while typing.Built quality is not up to the mark. Don't expect better quality at this price.The packaging is also not secured. In transportation high chances are there for damage.I can't excuse in proper packaging. Amzon must take care of packaging. Particularly in this product.
4,"Zebronics keyboard which has 12 multimedia keys, easy access to the music within the keyboard, volume up and down buttons are user friendly. It has a special Rupee key symbol which can be easily accessed, the USB cable is also pretty decent connects easily to any kind of computer and laptops."
1,"Not worth for even a single star, Exactly after 2 weeks of buying it, just found that if we have to move the keyboard frequently then for  a while the keyboard stops working due to some wire problem, the connecting usb wire is too hard and it got cracked at the joint of usb and keyboard , i have done jugaad and applied m-seal at the joints to stop wire from cracking more but all in vain as the portion covered is now ok but after that it started cracking again, the design is such that you keep pressing multiple alphabets simultaneously untill you get used to it ."
1,"IF YOU ARE GAMING ,YOU KNOW  U NEED SHIFT AND CTRL KEYS ALWAYS PRESSED EXAMPLE FOR MINECRAFT AND ASSASSINS , BUT THIS KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOESNT SUPPORT IT , FIRST ORDER THOUGHT ITS MANUFACTURER FAULT AND REPLACED RECEIVED SAME TYPE AGAIN , ALSO INSTALLED DRIVER FROM ZEBRONICS SITE NO LUCK , FINALLY APPLIED REFUND AND ORDERED DIFFERENT KEYBOARD FROM DIFFERENT BRAND . ALSO THERE SOME OTHER ISSUE LIKE IF SPACEBAR PRESSED SOMETIMES IN WINDOWS NOTIFICATION BAR POPS AND MINIMIZES EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING , SHIFT + W DOESNT STAYS CONTINUES , IF PLAYING ASSASSINS CREED YOUR PLAYER WILL STOP RUN STOP RUN IF SHIFT + W PRESSED , SAME FOR MINECRAFT WITH CTRL + W . DIDNT EXPECTED FROM ZEBRONICS FOR SUCH PATHETIC PRODUCT ."
2,"For me, when this item was delivered, the shipping box seemed all messed up. But that didn't alter my expectations at first.But, this keyboard actually seems like completely old stock inside out. As soon as I took it out of the cover, the left Alt key cap came out 😂. Also, the space bar stays pressed. Yes, it is light weight. I did give a replacement request in Amazon, but the keyboard seems to be released a long time ago too. The reason why I'm saying is mainly because of the logo on the Windows Start Key. Microsoft dropped this logo a long time ago with the release of Windows 8. Since then, most of the keyboards which came out feature the new Windows logo on their Start Keys. And all keyboards completely shifted to the new logo with the release of Windows 10. But this one still keeps the old logo. I did notice that the Month and year of import is October 2019 on the box. And I'm writing this review in October itself. That doesn't deter the fact that this might have been released long ago.I bought mine when Amazon was offering this item in a lightning deal of Rs. 209. Anyway, it's hard to expect something more from a keyboard worth Rs. 200. Might have been a good keyboard if the product was fine at least."
1,The quality is very bad and its not even solid like usual keyboards. I tried for return but its been upgraded for replacement. I don't understand why this is happening? You must allow customers to return item and give them full refund.
5,Good working condition and received safe and perfect product on time. Keys are smooth and auto installation made easy to access. Would suggest anyone to buy it.
3,"Keyboard quality is not that great, but okay for this price range. The position of the keys are slightly different from other standard keyboards, for example ""backslash"",""home"", ""end"" and ""enter"" key are wrongly positioned. Keyboard is a bit smaller but it is okay for me as long as the keys are properly positioned. It doesn't have a good grip, so we may have to place something underneath the keyboard if you are using a glass table.Bottom line:This may not be suitable for heavy typing or gaming but should be good enough for normal/light work. This can serve as a replacement keyboard for kid's computer as they tend to break the keyboards on regular basis."
5,"With the mark of Zebronics, purchasers need not have to worrry about a thing! The key board nicely fits to my working table, with its size is a little higher than the keyboard size of laptops. Any adult can easily lift and hold the entire keyboard and operate the keys using just the thumbs. If there is one thing that is highly interesting about this product is its chic design and its ideal size. Not to mention its functionality.  I can race my fingers across the keyboard with ease. If you are looking for a soft touch keying, you will be disappointed, but by using for a few days, you will get used to it. The one feature I dislike in this product is the ""home"" button is given below and the ""end"" button is given above. But, this is not an issue because the same keys can be operated in the rightmost portion of the key board, wherein the home button is above and the end button is below."
5,"I have been using this keyboard from more than 3 weeks.The keyboard came in a well mannered package.The best thing about the keyboard is, it is small in size and can be handles easily.All the buttons are working properly. The keyboard comes with a usb cable attached to the keyboard. The cable is neither too long nor too short.I have a lot of writing work to do, hence a lot of typing needs to be done and on these days of using the keyboard; I have not found any issues with the keysI had a lot of mixed emotions before buying this keyboard because the number of negative reviews here is more than positive.But the good this is:1) The delivery was on time.2) Keyboard came in a well packed condition.3) Keys are stable working.4) USB cable is working accurately."
2,"Pros-----> Cheap & expendablecons-----> Stiff keys and they get more stiff after usage of just 10 days.> Worse keyboard when it comes to ergonomics> Enter key is a flipped design which means the bigger portion of the Enter key is on the top portion due to this whenever i hit the enter key my pinky lands on the backward slash key which is very annoying> Key top wobbles a lot which means keys will live only for a short period> Last and the most hated thing about this keyboard is its placement of arrow keys, as shown in the image the arrow keys are not aligned properly so definitely you don't feel like using them a lot."
3,"Overall it is a good product if required for non-critical home use.However, It has been only couple of weeks after I purchased this keyboard, , and few  keys have caught moisture. because of which after pressing those keys, they get stuck inside and doesn't release on their own. So Now  I am having hard time while typing important emails.Pros:1. Cheap cost2. Keys are not NOISY at all.3. Matt finish on the surface saves the keys from fingerprints.4. Sleek design.Cons:1. Poor material as the cost is less, and hence may not have long life.2. Not reliable while using it for critical work."
2,"One of the most entry level keyboards. Extremely flimsy material, and should be handled with great care, else this may not last a month. First item delivered had a faulty 'R' key that needed lot more pressure, and an 'A' key which seemed to be somewhat tight in it's key well compared to most other keys, so in case of fast typing 'A' would be missed 4/10 times and 'R' would be missed 9/10 times. USB cable is very thin and flimsy, but not much worse than the keyboard itself. USB cable is about 1.5-2 feet long, so don't expect to be able type at a distance from the computer case. Ordered a replacement.Updated 13-Mar-2021: Some of the keys have become lot less responsive, i.e. I need to hit them several times or very hard for the entry to be recognized. Also at least 2 keys ('A' and 'R') are such that pressing them ones, leads to frequent multiple entries. Suggest staying away from this keyboard!Note that I bought that to use with few servers behind a KVM switch, which will run mostly headless, so the usage would be very very light. For anything more I'd never buy this keyboard, but spend a bit more money."
2,Keys are not at all good and cannot type fast as the keys are shaky. Took it attach it to my laptop for fast typing but didn't met the purpose.
2,"'Zebronics' Company has carved a good name for it in gadgets & utilities. BUT, this keyboard product is a tragic downfall.The keyboard though is nice in first appearance, has very hard key-presses, which make it a pain to use, and spelling errors start happening as one types because some keys don't get pressed by even pressure of the fingures.In a nut shell, the keyboard is just like a good looking 'toy' instead of being a useful and ergonomic utility.Unless, Zebronics change the base of the keys-- so as to make them work evenly with same fingure pressure, this product is a waste of money for serious utility buyers."
3,"Product was delivered in good condition and on time. Packing was done good. However, the wire of the keyboard is very short. If you want something which requires access to a bigger area/table, this is not the one. Also, I'm facing an issue with the Ctrl + c command. IT should copy paste when we use this but instead I get print screen option. Out of ten times i used this command, I got the wrong print screen. Restarted my pc twice, toggled the the property in cmd as well, however, I'm not sure what is exactly wrong. I tried using a different keyboard and this issue never presented with that keyboard. So I either got a defective product or there is a command issue with this one.All in all, an okay product but I will never be buying this product ever again."
1,"After 1 day of use, many of the keys are hard / getting stuck (important keys - TAB, CTRL, BACKSPACE, ARROW KEYS, and some letters as well)I had purchased this product from Amazon earlier and it was fine. This time the quality is very poor. Unfortunately I opened it after 7 days so it is outside the return window.ZEBRONICS' 'warranty' is a joke - they expect you to commute 40 kms and spend 100 rupees to 'show' them a Rs. 400 which they 'will inspect' and possibly decline replacement!Last time I buy such cheap products. Better to spend double the amount and go with trustworthy brands that have sensible service."
2,"I bought this keyboard a few days ago. I find this keyboard very light, the good side is i like the special buttons for volume control, media player etc. The sad part is the keys are not very good or say very poor quality and some keys have already started to not work. I have press it hard to get the number or letter. The length of the usb cable is just 1mtr whereas other keyboards provide atleast 2 meters this really does make a difference in the long run.Overall i would say its only worth what you are paying it for. Okay for average use but for serious use not a good option."
4,"I got this product for INR299. Price to Perform Ratio is decent.I haven't added any pictures but believe me it's a genuine review after 15days of usage.Pros -1 - The price if the keyboard is quite decent. (INR299)2 - Main pros about this keyboard is it's a Full Size Island keyboard.3 - It has big size Left Shift, Left Enter and Right Shift Button.4 - Button Order and placement is also decent.5 - Keystorke and Response is also decent. (At this price can't expect mechanical or semi mechanical like button response).6 - All Button Works wih Windows 10. All multimedia buttons also works.Cons -1 - Weight is not that high. (Don't get me wrong about the sturdyness of the Keyboard.)2 - Doesn't have Palm rest.3 - Cable quality is not that high. *Feels cheap to me.4 - Power consumption is also good on laptop.Let me tell you if you're a fast typer or if you have work which needs fast typing then this is not for you. This keyboard is for general usage and for general people. The price on which i got this keyboard is good. Can't expect much.I hope I answered your queries. :)"
5,"Don't go for high end brand when you have many benefits in this range. Keys are very easy to press. Lightweight ,compact design And have long cable to move easily and freely. Using for past few months. But as it is very light weight because of the body material so Use carefully.No gaming experience"
1,"I thought it will be a good cheap keyboard. It was cheap but not good. That's the problem it's just too cheap to be of any use. The keyboard is tok light to stay in place, the keys are very bad, typing experience is horrible. The keyboard is so flimsy that it flexes with a simple key press in the middle. Ultimately you get y what you pay for. Font buy this, you will struggle to use it. I couldn't even return the product, apparently I was only getting the option to replace it."
5,"Had received a faulty product. The keys were so soft that one touch would result in multiple entries of fame alphabet. Requested for replacement and got a new piece the next morning itself. The new keyboard is working fine now. Five star for product, 1 star for quality check procedure of the seller, five star to seller for quick response and replacement action"
1,"1. Layout of keys is absurd. Just to save an inch of space, the Delete, Home, End etc buttons are placed in a random order vertically.2. Keys are very sticky. Initially I thought the keyboard would smoothen after some use. But after three months the keys are even more tight and hard to press. In a typing flow, we miss many keys and have to retype them.3. The plastic quality is so poor that keyboard bends in the middle. Seems it can break any moment.4. Definitely not a gaming keyboard. Even I won't recommend anyone for typing purposes.Better to go for a slightly higher price keyboard. This one is really wastage of any money."
3,"This keyboard is very light weight with minimal material used for its making. The keys are soft, responsive and feels good for typing. A host of multimedia controls are available at the top which I must say this is the cheapest multimedia keyboard I brought to date. But if you are a person who type a lot then better pay extra & get yourself a high quality keyboard. This keyboard seems it won't last two months if you keep hitting hard on the keys. If you have a basic PC for which you need a keyboard for general use then its fine."
5,"I odrered this for my laptop. Came in a brand named cardboard box pacaking which we normally get when buying electronic items. But product is intact. Length of thr keyboard is 41 cm, breadth is 12.8cm and height is almost 2cm""(including key protrusion ).  Letters and symbols on the keys are coated well. I tried to scratch the letters on the keys with my nail and did not came off from the keys.ligh weight keyboard. Keys are soft touch too. Over all good product for normal usage"
1,"I've been using computer peripherals keyboards since the year 2000 and this is the worst one I had the misfortune to buy.It has been only a month and the keys gave up. Ctrl, Alt and Num lock keys stopped working altogether. Rest of the keys needs to be wrestled with a million times before giving any sound character outpit."
5,"Though got a damaged one and had 3 keys fallen to the right side of the keyboard in the package, I managed to put them back and keyboard worked perfectly, so kept it without asking for a replacement. Request the seller to be careful in future shipments.The keyboard worked perfectly and loving it, fit and finish, quality of plastic, cable and connector seems to be quite good for the price. My purpose for occasional use with laptop."
1,"This is the worst keyboard ever. It sells so cheaply for a reason - quality comes at a price. You're better off using a Windows on-screen keyboard, and click away at it with a mouse. You'd still be faster and more accurate than this keyboard.Pros: It's cheapCons: It's cheaply sold, cheaply made and performs cheaply. The key positions are different, which is understandable as it's not full sized keyboard. But the worst quality of all is the hardness of the key press. For a fast typer, it's so hard to press common keys like Enter, Backspace or Delete that your fingers start cramping up.You're better off burning your 200rs than buying this keyboard. It's the absolute worst"
3,"I needed a basic keyboard to replace my old logitech one. The zebronics multimedia keyboard is good value for money and comes with added hot key controls such as sleep, wake up, volume up/down and system shutdown.Will highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap and basic alternative to the more expensive keyboards in the market.Edit 3-Dec-2020 - I am cutting down 2 stars because I have had issues with the keys not responding or they tend to type multiple times for just one keypress which is a headache. Unplugging the USB connector and connecting it back seems to fix the problem, but only temporarily"
1,"Do not buy this piece of garbage- very cheap quality- keys getting stuck within 1.5 months of use- shape of enter key is weird, different than normal- Not returnableI agree it is small and light but still cons outweigh these by landslide.Verdict: Don't Buy. Invest some more and have peace of mind."
3,"Read it properly. This keyboard is a great stealth keyboard for typing and normal use but for gaming, it is not suitable. I have had the worst issue. One of the main features for a keyboard mainly for RPG games, the anti-ghost feature is not available here, which means you can not use 3 keys simultaneously while gaming i.e if you sprint using W + SHIFT key then you cannot jump using SPACEBAR or any other key. I have faced it in Assassins creed and PUBG where you have to jump heavily while running. So make proper research before you buy a normal keyboard for gaming. I had no idea about this feature earlier. And as per amazon policy, you can't get a refund, only a replacement. So you will be trapped. Apart from this, it's a good keyboard for typing and normal use."
5,"I bought it for Rs. 450. The printed price is Rs. 649.This is a soft keyboard.Pros-1. The build quality is excellent.2. The keyboard is a soft keyboard. It means that there is no space for the dust to go inside the keyboard. The space between the buttons is filled by the plastic cover. (as shown in the pics).3. It has all the required buttons.4. The number-pad is given at the right side which is an additional advantage.5. The buttons are extremely soft and easy to press.6. The cable is also very good and lengthy. It is around 1.5m long.7. There are two stands provided at the bottom (one at left and one at right). You can use these stands and thus make is somewhat inclined in order make its use more comfortable.8. The lights for Numlock, Capslock, Scroll lock are provided. These light in white color and are quite bright.9. Less chance for dust collection in the keyboard as there is not much space for the dust to go inside.Cons-1. The keyboard is way too soft. If you are a hard keyboard user then initially you'll face some difficulty using it. It may happen quite often that you press any key for on letter and the same letter may get printed more than 2 times. So if you are a traditional keyboard user (hard keyboard user) then you need a few days to get used to it.This is actually not a con because this is somewhat advanced design.2. Somewhat costly. You can get some cheap keyboard in local market but obviously the quality of those is nowhere close to this one.Final comment- If you want to purchase a keyboard for a laptop or PC and if you can afford it, it is the best available choice in the market. Go for it without thinking twice."
3,"This sleekly designed keyboard comes with chiclet styled keys (keys with low height, like on the iMacs or laptops). I went for this design because of the low key height, so that even if they get hard with dust later on, the low height will make it less stressful to press.. The narrow design of the keyboard is good for making it fit in small space. There are small, sleek indicator lights on num/cap/scroll locks.However, on the negative side, the keys double press for fast typists like me. I have to correct a lot of my typing once I am done using this keyboard. Another problem are the media keys that rely on ""function"" keys. You can activate them for the session permanently by pressing a combination of the FN and ESC, but that doesn't remain after restarts, and also makes the actual F9–F12 keys secondary.For the cost spent, this is a decent keyboard, but not as great as other reviews make it out to be."
1,"I've been using this for a year. The keys were soft when it was new. Over the months, the keys slowly became hard. It was gradual so it was difficult to notice the change until my finger tips started paining and I realised that it's because of the hard keys. This product has around 4.5 rating. I am guessing all have reviewed after purchase and not updated after a year of use!"
1,"The keyboard is of cheap quality, the cheapness is to the extent of keys getting struck all the time. I am very disappointed for the value I am receiving. I am sure such a cheap quality can't be unnoticeable to users and even getting to think that if Amazon is manipulating user reviews to trick buyers go for products which are not worthy of buying. The review ratings are like a joke now."
2,"#Design:Noting to say here we can see what is in the picture it's almost same, although I expected little slimmer like my laptop, it is double the height of my laptop keys, (I had added an image for its real comparison)I went for this design because of the low key height, so that it will be less stressful to press.but here comes the twist after use of 2-3 month the ctrl button becomes very hard and it slows down my typing speed,to press the ctrl button, need to press on the centre of the button if you try to click on the corner it will not press even if you put all the pressure you have in your little finger.#Problems I face (issue)1. buttons not slim as expected2. some buttons get very hard which need extra attention while typing.#Openion / Summarydon't buy if you want something slim and soft button to work,No issue if you only want to play games or not a regular user."
1,"Given the Brand's name I bought this keyboard blindly.But I found the keys pretty hard to press on the first day itself. I thought it maybe because it's new and would be easier with time. But to my horror, the keys went becoming hard and hard by the day.Now, after around 1 year of usage, the keys have become too hard to type anything smoothly. Every time I type I have to make sure all the letters are in place. Fingers also have started to pain.WORST EXPERIENCE.GENUINE REVIEW AFTER ALMOST 1 YEAR OF USAGE"
1,"I'm writing this review after using the keyboard for more than a year.Please do not buy this keyboard - I'm currently having a bad experience in gaming or even moderate typing. The keys stick to board and I have to tap hard to get them unstuck.I'm looking for alternatives now. My previous Keyboard was extremely good, lasted for almost 10 years and was of Logitech brand. Don't go for DELL keyboards. Not worth the money."
5,A very good product. Durable. After using for past 1 year it's still working like the same way it is working at the time it was new . Didn't face any type of problem till now. Very nice product. The key is also good very comfortable during typing.
5,"One of the best keyboards I have ever used. Very good for heavy and extensive daily use. Being used to Macbook keyboard and other keyboards, the different position of CTRL Key, Command key in Mac, Option key and Alt keys....will take some time in getting used to it. Other than that, this is the best quality keyboard with no noise at all, cannot hear typing. Overall Keyboard is compact and small, the main Querty keyboard is the size of 15.6 inch Macbook keyboard, but again not a problem for me. I just hope that this should last longer, next time going to buy the same. A really Dell brand high class product."
5,"This is the best PC keyboard I have used so far. Quick type. Laptop feeling! This chiclet is just so lovely. I am sure this is one of the best keyboard for PC. However, there is one problem. I feel the gaps while typing and this mean keys are not where the keys is normally found. This means when tying R you may type T. Migrating from Laptop keys is the issue because in Laptop there is absolutely no gap. I feel one has imagine the keys a little left and it can be get used to. After two days I am 95% corrected the typing errors without looking at the keyboard. I want to take it to 99% in the next 5-6 days. Ihope my will help those who want to get into the technicalities and details. But yes, it does give ""that laptop feeling"" while pressing them. I think it will be last for more than 5 years even if it is used roughly. You can say ""manhandling"""
5,"The keyboard is very smooth comfortable to operate.Pros:1. Chiclet type keys like laptop.2. Good key layout.3. Very easy to clean with a brush.4. Less sound and feather touch.5. Easy to install, just plug n play.Cons:The keyboard is somewhat long than normal keyboard, some may find it difficult to put in a keyboard tray."
5,"Got this delivered, couple of days back, well withing time and neatly packed. Its a superb keyboard, have used it quite a lot, in the past 2/3 days and the typing experience has been sublime. The keys are well placed and the build quality is excellent, so should be able stand the test of time. My laptop's keyboard has been acting up a bit so couldn't have asked for a better substitute. Its efficient/comfortable and convenient.Thanks Dell/Amazon!!"
5,"I used it to replace an 8 years old Dell KB 212 that came with my Dell Inspiron 620s. Some of it's keys recently stopped working. Could have been dust or water damage. Now if i wanted, i could get a mechanical keyboard, may be Redgear with brown switches but i really don't think they're worth it as the price difference is just too much. Also, i wanted a compact keyboard similar to my Dell KB 212 and there was no keyboard that was even close to Dell KB 216. So i hurriedly ordered it and to my surprise, it actually feels better and is even smaller than Dell KB 212. Though the biggest change i see is that it's silent which is good and 3 Extra buttons for volume. Highly recommended."
4,"The first time I ordered the keyboard, I received a defective one wherein the down arrow key wasn't working. I promptly applied for an exchange and got my replacement from Amazon without any hassles.It's a great keyboard considering I use it only for programming or writing code. It's not ergonomic but even after using it for 8-10 hours a day, I don't face any issues. I haven't used it for gaming at all.Overall, for plain typing or programming tasks, this is great value for money."
5,"I touch type and that at times results in genetic typing...my earlier keyboard, though not mechanical would make a considerable sound.It was bothering everyone around at office.Also the keyboard was reaching end of life.Also the earlier keyboard was wireless....It would lag at times for no reason and after pressing say 10 or so characters in rapid succession it would kind of hang or seem to ""buffer"" and then all characters would appear at once. The batteries were also depleting frequently...my heavy usage could've been one reason....but...they would deplete in 3 to 4 months...So decided to go for a USB keyboard..I did a lot of research before going for this.. Very happy with the keyboard...It's astonishing quiet, the keys feel good under the fingers...build quality is amazing....Very happy user here."
4,"I am a programmer who types a lot of code each day. Most of the keyboards I have used has faded the key prints.  This is a chiclet keys, easy to type if you are used to laptop keyboards.. Spacing is odd, and even prone to typos.. They keys started getting polished because of the heavy typing. also some keys which i use the most (ctrl, space, a, s, shift, backspace, arrow keys) have started wearing down to bottom. Still the most durable chiclet keyboard I have used. With audio controls, this is the best entry level keyboard.. Still the keys have become noisy..."
2,"It's noisy!Seems flimsy, cheap and plasticky.Not like the keyboard on my Dell laptop in terms of touchThe labelling of the letters is stuck over the plastic keys and it's so evident - feels like it will get worn out very soon - or can get scratched if you have very 'curious nails'.The size and layout seems fine.The look seems elegant and sleek.Overall I am not happy with the quality of this product when it comes to touch (which is important as that's how you use a keyboard!).There are some useful functions like volume keys and so on, but not useful to me personally as I don't use my PC for media at all.I had to buy this as I wasn't getting a DELL wireless keyboard without a mouse - as I had purchased a DELL mouse few months ago - weird restriction from DELL! I was let with no choice other than buying a non-DELL product or an extra mouse or this.Maybe my expectations were high from being a historical HP customer who is used to reasonably quality products? I don't know. So far I'm not pleased with the purchase."
4,Update:Thank you for the replacement exchange. The replacement keyboard works fine. Does the job well unlike the previously shipped one. All keys working and smooth. So increased the ⭐ rating to 4 from 1 as per my previous review as below.Review 2 days agoAt least 5 keys were not working so I have requested a return and replacement. There was no refund option so Awaiting a working product. I will update the review once I receive a replacement keyboard
3,"Just received it. Cheap quality plastic is used. I have been using this same model keyboard from last 4 years(2017), the one i purchased in 2017 has really good quality plastic keys. But since the wire was damaged, i wanted to have same model keyboard, order and got this, now i am disappointed.Dell shouldn't compromise on quality, increase the price, that's fine. I love spacing, layout and size of keys, hope it had good plastic too."
4,Product quality is good. easy to use...
5,"This is a pretty descent for people who want to do occasional typing. Key travel is good and feedback is okay.But dont get this keyboard for gaming. Lacks anti ghost support meaning you cannot use 3-4 keys at a time which is important in many games.For programmers, look for a mechanical keyboard rather than this."
2,"I'm using this keyboard for the past 1 year. The keys started to stick on the bottom when pressing after 3 months itself. That makes the typing experience annoying all the time. Now also while typing this ""A"" letter stuck (Stay pressed) while pressing.On gaming the problem is really a headache most of the time I don't even know what happens on the game then I came to notice the ""Ctrl"" button is staying pressed. Very Annoying."
5,"This was bought in 23rd August,2019 and is still working without any issues till date (21st August,2021).I bought it for the slender chiclet keys which are soft enough to be used.The LED for Num lock, Caps lock and Scroll lock are present. But, we would need the Fn key to enable the scroll lock which isn't such a big deal;as I haven't ever used scroll lock in my over 16 years of using PC.The right click button on the left of the right Control key is the one which some keyboards don't have on them. The right click key present here is a life saver when the mouse doesn't work; as I can navigate with keyboard shortcuts alone with expertise."
5,"I am using four keyboards.1. Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L white LED Cherry MX Blue switches.2. TVS Gold Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches.3. Asus Cerberus gaming keyboard.4. This very keyboard for which I am writing a review.I must say, if you want to do programming, just grab this keyboard with your eyes shut. Superb keyboard. Even if it gets damaged at any point of time, you can certainly buy a new one coz its cheap. Don't get me wrong, This is a durable keyboard. Got comfort for hands, even better than the cooler master's keyboard. I back-light is not a concern, buy this.you can get 11 dell keyboards in price of 1 cooler master masterkeys L pro white led keyboard. I am so happy with this keyboard. The chicklet keys are breeze for typing. I have typed more than 3000 words with this keyboard without fatigue. Just buy it. It's worth every penny."
4,So far so good. Tactile buttons. Surdy looking. No squeaky sounds. Button placements seems good. Overall a nice keyboard. Watch out for lighting deals to save extra
2,"I'm writing this review within first two hours of  delivery.Its not that cool as I thought of a dell product.cons:1)The backspace key don't work as other normal key work .  you have to use two finger to press button with same force or press it hard as you press enter.2)The buttons are not at all smooth to press, you have to put some force.3)The wire quality is not good.4)Made in China"
1,I don't know whether the seller or Dell is doing bad here. The quality of the keyboard is very poor. The keys are supposed to soft press. But this remembers me of the old typewriter. Keys are very hard. Very poor keyboard. Programmers do not buy this at any cost. I'd be returning this if possible.Nope! no return for this item.
5,The ideal keyboard for PC.Easy USB connection.Keys are really smooth to press and well organised.You might find some extra function keys than the old keyboards.The only thing I feel missing is its palm rest which isn't available for separate purchase on Amazon.But haven't faced any significant problems without them though.Overall very good product!
1,The buttons are not bright white as seen in photo. The size of buttons is very small and  it is not silent type key press.. it does not look original product as I use the same dell keyboard in office. It Looks like a cheep Chinese product. But I got it for 560rs. I would not have paid more for this keyboard... after couple of months I will have to buy a better one...
1,"After two days of use, i face the following issue with the keyboard. Many times, when the letter ""e"" and ""o"" pressed even once is typed continuously for 10 to 15 times. I had to press backspace and write again. Very low quality. I could not return and option is only for exchange of exact same item which is even more bad."
3,"I am having problems with this keyboard since it is not standard size. Touch typing is difficult since the fingers land on the wrong key. The key size and key spacing is not standard. The product description did not mention this, although it uses the word ""compact"". I cannot return this also, which is disappointing."
1,"I wanted to replace my aging hp keyboard that came with my computer because keys were getting sticky. Just in a few months the keys of the new keyboard have started getting stuck in pressed position resulting in likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I have to go back often and delete extra text and unpress the stuck key. This is supposed to be a good basic dell keyboard, but looks like poor quality control"
4,"Okay, so I think this is a very good keyboard from dell. But I was looking for a keyboard which looks and works like a laptop. With the keyboard having low-key travel I thought it would work great but it was nowhere close to a laptop's keyboard. very much higher key travel and softer keys instead of chicklet style keys which didn't give that satisfaction of typing for long durations. I would have kept it but the full-size feature of the keyboard worked as a curse for me having typing on the laptop for a long while, I just can't accept a keyboard that big. So unfortunately I have to return it. but the keyboard is great if you are a beginner and you are looking for a keyboard on your PC. I don't think so that any company other makes great keyboard with low key travel so I will probably order something from abroad as after looking in the Indian market, I don't think so that anything can satisfy my needs as of now for the budget I would like to spend on my keyboard.Well that's all for today folks so if any day you're thinking so buy this keyboard having laptop-like feel in mind then please consider something else, other than that you can go ahead and get this one!"
2,"I am writing this after using it for 4 months now. My Dell Latitude is a small sized laptop with which I used to have Logitech keyboard, which was very good but that belonged to the office. Just a week before the official lockdown announcement I started to work from home and that Logitech stayed back in the office. I always wanted to have a chiclet keyboard and ordered this. The Keyboard itself very solidly built, fill points to that. The problem I am facing is that it will stop working after 3-4 hours of use. First you will notice a lag in response and after that it just stops working. I have three other laptops and it behaves the same.  That's the reason for 2 stars."
5,"Hi, I am working from home. I already have a mechanical keyboard. But, it makes hell lot of clicky sounds which gives me headache at times. I was looking for a keyboard which makes near to no sound on clicking. Finally, I zeroed on to this keyboard. And, trust me this keyboard has made me so happy. I liked its chiclet keys. Affordable and soft keys. It is not for gaming purposes but only for normal day-to-day work. Thanks Amazon you are the saviour in this Pandemic.. 💕💞"
5,"Pros:Compact keyboard, soft touch but there is enough pressure that prevents accidental & very delicate touches from registering a keystroke. Your wpm will really improve after switching to this keyboard from a fully mechanical keyboard.Cons:The space bar could have been a bit more wider and curvy in design. function keys' width could have been more, just like a mechanical keyboard."
1,Don't take anybody this is the waste keyboard and mouse don't use this model please try another models
5,"Mouse is very comfortable and Size is really Big..(comparison pictures attached)Previously I was using Zebronics PRAXIS keyboard.. wanted to buy that, but was not available as it is discontinued by Company."
3,Nice and awsum product....
4,Product is good and very useful. Plastics also good quality. Mouse has trouble working on bright surface whether opaque or semi-opaque mouse pad. Had to buy a dark color mouse pad Rs. 40.Kids drop the mouse more 100 times from a height of 4 feet but every time it survives very nicely !!
5,"Very good product does its job, cost effective also."
5,Great product for value for money.Plastic quality can be improved for keyboard but mouse is pretty good.For daily use it can usable.
5,The keyboard and mouse is very good for your everyday use. I bought it because my laptop's keyboard was not working and it does the job very well.
5,beautiful & awesome
5,Got it as a back up to my wireless keyboard n mouse when system crashes. Coz it happened recently and wireless was useless till I got windows reinstalled at a vendor.Good finish and fell of plastic. Immediately connected which is nice.Using mouse for my laptop which is nice breather to the mouse pad.
5,"Normal, no negative impact... usefull for continues working"
5,i bought it for RS.299 in Great Indian Sale100% Value for money & still working properly
5,It is a good keyboard. Unlike other mouseit's mouse has a detailed touch. It responses very quickly.
5,Good product
5,"Excellent than expected 👍. Good quality.One thing like a suggestion is that, keyboard and Mouse wires are like very thin, consider a little thicker wire.Overall the product is superb."
5,Keyboard is to smooth and good for office use.
5,Liked
5,Goid peice  works well as an externa kl keyboard and mouse to my HP tab
5,Awesome product
5,Good Product with cheap and best very economic with efficient quality
5,Excellent product from zebronics. By seeing the price I thought that the material quality will be cheap. Felt wrong when I started using it. Keyboard has Soft keys interface. Go for it.
5,Good product and smooth button key
5,After delivered to me am open the box at the times some key are removed not plugged properly. After that place prop.in keyboard.No others issues.Please ensure one more time before delivery.Mouse too good.
5,"On my first delivery,  some keyboard keys were not there. So i returned it and got good keyboard. So far looks great"
5,Happy to received this . Both items New and working good thanks to dealer.
5,Nice 👍
5,"Best Keyboard using since 4days Exellent Performence . |Best For Gaming and Office Work|Good delivery, fastPlayed many games on it eg. Gta Vice City etc. Thank you Amazon And Zebronics"
5,Keyboard button are so soft to touch gives a feel of mechanical keyboard overall Very happy with this product
5,Not bad! I am happy that it was available online. I don't have to go to the shop.
5,Again satisfied with Amazon... Great product and good delivery.. TYSM
5,"Awsome product, value for money"
5,"good product, right performance."
5,Good
5,Hi super
5,Keyboard is silent its too good to type at night Product is too good and completely Swadeshi Jay Hind.
5,"It has been quite handy, and had an exquisite performance with my laptop."
5,Good to use...
5,Not made for gaming for daily use it is great...
5,This is helpful we can use this in any laptops good for gaming means this the best product
5,Combo offer is best
5,Awesome product
1,"Bought it two days ago. Outside packaging was good but original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle was missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement."
5,"Excellent keyboard and mouse combo. Silent touch is very nice, I can't hear any sound from keyboard very quiet. I like it is water proof and has vents and holes in the bottom to drain any accidental spills. Mouse works and tracks nicely, accurate to the clicks and double clicks. One dongle only for the keyboard and mouse so no need to worry about using up 2 ports. Both mouse and keyboard has a place to plug the USB dongle while not in use so you don't fear of losing. Also both mouse and keyboard has on-off buttons so you can save battery by switching it off by your end of day."
3,"No issues with the functioning of the keyboard and mouse. They are both working well. I am satisfied with the ""silent"" feature. However, I found the keyboard keys slightly harder on the fingers than I would like. And my biggest issue is, the mouse doesn't come with rubber base. So it slips if you use it on a slanted table/desk. It's not even standing on normal mouse pads. I have to find a mouse pad that has a non-smooth antislip surface.Update after 6 months of minimal usage : Left button of the mouse stopped working. The mouse is useless now."
5,"The keyboard is excellent. As described in the product description it is very silent. I can’t hear it over my fan. That is more than good enough for me. I bought this product assuming that I can connect it to Logitech unifying receiver. I have a M720 mouse which I love to bits. I wanted to give this mouse to my wife and use just the keyboard. I realized only after unboxing that it will only work with the USB dongle it came with. I wanted to return the product, I tried using the keyboard for a day and decided the keyboard alone was worth paying the 2,500 and I kept the product. I wish the keyboard is supported by the Logitech options software. I could have changed the key binding of some of the shortcut keys given at the top.Don’t get me wrong mouse is not bad, it just too small for me. I am very used to my M720 which is almost as big as MX Master. Mouse tracking is good. But, as mentioned in some other reviews it is super light and have very little resistance on a wooden table. It just flies from one corner of the screen to another. May be with some use I can get used to the weight of this mouse. It is not a fair comparison to compare this to my M720 as that mouse alone cost almost twice as much as this combo. This mouse is supported by the Logitech options software and you can assign around 5 shortcuts to the mouse which is great to see at this price point."
1,Very poor order delivery. First time the order was received without the usb receiver. Returned and reordered. The rellace.ent came without the mouse !!
3,"After 2 days:Keyboard is not working in Mac and Ubuntu/Linux OS.I need to close to the USB receiver ( 2-5cm distance) in order to work.For this price 2395 it is not worth.Other keyboard K220 bought a year before working fine. Need a replacement.Initial Impression:This is one of the best keyboard and mouse i ever used.Typing speed is absolutly very smooth and there is no key press sound. Very little noise but it wont disturb any one who is near by.Mouse is really silky smooth and no click sound at all.only thing it has very soft keys no soundmouse is really smooth and very silent.Price wise this is little high 2395, if it is 1999 it would be best value for money.one USB nano receiver is great to handle both keyboard and mouse.I am using this keyboard for my raspberry pi 4. Since RPI4 has limitted USB ports so using this one USB receiver is really helpful."
1,5 stars for product but 2 stars for seller.Product received was not seal packed. I could make out that tapes were opened and then re-pasted. The mouse from keyboard mouse combo was not working. Keyboard was working very well.So i placed return with replacement order. I received the replacement within a day but i was scared looking at the condition of the replaced product box. It was battered with tape applied instead of original seal tape. I have uploaded photographs of the packing.Fortunately this time both mouse and keyboard are working and are working good.
3,"I received the the product in just 9 hours, delivery wise and packaging wise everything was good, the boxes were in very good condition without any damageChanging my comment on the product in just two days.  1) I feel the key press should have been little more softer  2) I did one test with this keyboard and the dell laptop keyboard in the night when it completely pin drop silence  environment.  what i observed was that the dell laptop keyboard is also not silent but the key press noise is lower  compare to the Logitech keyboard.  i tried typing few sentences with the Logitech keyboard and same sentences again with the dell laptop  keyboard.  3) if you type slow also there is noise on the key press.  4) found that only the alpha keys , numeric keys(not the numpad keys) , arrow keys,  5) space bar, tab, enter, shift, alt, ctrl key are somewhat silent compared to the alpha and numeric keys  6) Price is very high  and the usb receiver is also not unifying one at this price.  7) even the click of the mouse button is not silent as mentioned. I have Logitech M331, which is way silent than  the M220 mouse provided with the keyboard.reducing my rating of this product just because it does not meet the requirement of silent touch, also i have given the product 3 star just because it is not that bad as well if you see the other aspects of product like the plastic quality is good, you have volume control option and also I don't have any doubt on the battery life because i have already used Logitech product earlier as well and they proved to be lasting longer compared to dell mouse where i used to change the batteries twice or thrice in a month."
5,"i liked the keyboard, i have the habit working late with my kids working beside. typing my older keyboards wake up my kid and disturb his sleep. this is one is so silent soft work. very sift srispy typing feel i get. it has capslock indicator which is sufficient for as numlocks and scroll locks i hardly use.Mouse too is very silent soft. it has very high promising battery life, hop it lasts long.It has been 8 months, now i observe first signs of low battery, connectivity issues comes up. Yes alkaline batteries do last long, really long in this keyboard"
5,"Writing this review after one week of use.It is a very good quality combo set of keyboard and mouse.. Received in perfect condition. Keyboard and Mouse both are super silent (no tik-tik anymore). Full size keyboard. Medium size mouse (Model: M220-SilentTouch). Just plug the tiny receiver, switch ON the keyboard and Mouse buttons and it immediately starts working. Get rid of hassles of wiresI had also checked Logitech MK270R combo which was approx. Rs.1000 less than this but finally decided to go with this due to the factors such as Silent Touch, Longer Battery Life and Newer Model. And after using it for a week, I think it was a good decision.I recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of wiring around their PC/Laptop and looking for clean desk.Overall a very nice product and good buy."
5,"Finally the best after trying 3 different one, tired the Dell entry level combo (that was undoubted worst) then tried Logitech MK345 it works like a typewriter ( key punch sounds) , sold that on olx for half the price when I purchased this one . Not about the product . Its just AWSOME ! , the key feel and the mouse both . Keyboard is very well built and feels great . Both keyboard and mouse have rugged feel when you touch. Its great in the Work from Home environment specially if you work late night and don't want to disturb  someone with the keystrokes and mouse clicks . Not only keyboard even the mouse clicks are (almost) noise less . This is not 100% silent but no one should be able to hear and gets disturbed by the keystroke noise . if you want to quantify of noise eradication will it eradicates more than 90-95% key click noise"
4,Wow.. i am really surprised with this keyboard. This is exactly what i was looking for in a keyboard all my life. I have been searching for a keyboard where i dont get those irritated clicking noise in my mouse and keyboard both and wanted a very soft touching slient option. My search ended here. But my search was little ruined as the layout of the keyboard is not to my taste.The buttons dont have spacing between them. Even the lines between keys are not much. I want a better layout to make this as perfect choice of keyboard for life.I like big layout style keyboard for faster typing speeds along with hand rest at the bottom and multimedia keys for faster handling of medias.
1,"The moment I opened the package, I could see that it was already opened by someone and then put together half heartedly. I anyway gave it a chance and connected to my laptop. The connection was fast and there was no visible lag. However, the keys were malfunctioning a lot. Changing language automatically, some of the keys not working at times (you have to remove the receiver and plug it in again). I have raised a request for the replacement. Will update once the replacement is here."
4,"What I like:1. Excellent keyboard. Just the right weight, sturdy, does not slide away when you type, good wireless connection, smooth & silent typing, good travel of keys. Note: This keyboard makes absolutely no sound at all and if you are one who enjoys your keyboard's sound - this is not the product for you.2. The mouse is precise in its working. Clicks are silent.3. Product is well packaged. The receiver is kept in an easily accessible place in the carton box.4. There is a place to store the receiver (below the keyboard), if you wish to carry the product around.What could have been better:1. The mouse is very small for my hand. For this price, they could have given a full size mouse. The current mouse is not comfortable to use if you have medium to large hands.2. The scroll wheel of the mouse is very noisy.2. The caps-lock LED is almost useless as it is too dim to be visible during the day."
5,"The keys are silent - they don't make clicky noises. That's not to say it doesn't make sound, it does. It's just muffled and low-frequency.The keys are sturdy and seem to be of good quality for the price. I personally feel there's a bit too much resistance though. Typing casually is fine, but if you're a writer and write multiple pages per day, maybe you should consider chicklet style keys. I use this primarily for work, to compose a few emails per day, interact with others on chat, and create occasional documents, and I have been very satisfied with it. On long typing sessions, it sure gives your fingers a workout, but it's not a deal breaker."
4,"The keyboard is extremely quiet, although the typing is not that comfortable due to the key feedback being a little too hard. Maybe that will be ok after getting used to it.Separate indicator for caps lock but none for num lock. Otherwise keyboard has all the keys in the right place.Truly plug and play with both Ubuntu and Windows"
4,"This is a good product. I am writing this review after using this keyboard-mouse combo for around 1 month and I am satisfied with this product.Keyboard is about 90% silent and is easy to use; no tak-tak noise but still some sort of sound is there while typing, which is ok. Also Mouse is working good and has a good grip."
4,"I don’t think I can get used to using this silent touch, basically compared to the mechanical keyboard I have used, I think I keep getting the keys wrong always, it feels small and does not fit well. The typing experience is a bit down but it’s super silent for one and has the promised wireless. Basically I needed it for using whenever I get on bed, so it doesn’t father me much now, but as a main keyboard it lacks at a lot of places, at this price range"
4,Box was a mess(the sets box). But the product itself is very very silent. If you using mk270 then the difference will be the feel of mesh can be felt clearly. So if you dont mind little hard on gaming you can go for it else 270 or some other i guess? Only 4 stars since box is ruined.Ps: The switch sure helps out the battery.
1,The keyboard isn't working properly. There is so much lag sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Such a pathetic product with such high price. Bought it after reading reviews but all my money got wasted. Logitech being such a big and famous brand selling such kind of products. Shame!!
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Product is amazing. Very soft keys and silent as they mentioned.  Mouse is good as well but in my case i got used one so asked for replacement.
5,"Connected immediately to my macbook with no issues at all.Is very smooth, silent and seamless typing experience - I am sure it will help improve the productivity. Mouse is working quite well too.  Build quality is pretty decent and it claims to be spill-proof which I hope I don’t have to test... ;)"
4,"Very good product no doubt but there are some disadvantages in it, which should be modified I think!First of all, there's no Num Lock indicator in the keyboard.Secondly, dislike the mouse, the keyboard on/off switch don't have any color (Red/Green) indication."
5,This is one the best silent wireless keyboard & mouse.FN keys dosn`t have any secondary keys like (multimedia shortcuts) which is good thing for the ppl who uses software like autocad & 3d design software & dedicated multimedia buttons are provided on the above of FN keys.this model is very very silent & good for those who is doing WFH & so that no one gets disturbed by keyboard/mouse pressing sounds & this keyboard & mouse has on/off switch too.loved it very much.CAPSLOCK INDICATOR LIGHT PRESENT & it dosnt switches off automaticaalyBUT NUM LOCK LIGHT NOT PRESENT.
4,"It's good only for a limited use, not for programming or typing.I liked its silent touch technology. Worth it!Only the wheel of the mouse makes high noise, in fact some poor grade kind of mouse noise.Again, the Amazon delivery is the worst, no bubble wrapping, no brown paper box. One of the corners of the keyboard got broken a bit."
4,Overall product is good. I cannot comment on battery as its news so use ur judgement. The only sketchy part is the on/off slide switch they are of plastic and i don't know how long would they survive esp the mouse one.. I felt they should have used the metal switch like dell which could be robust for the price we are paying. That's it for now. Cheers!
1,"I bought this product and found Keyboard is not working properly. I had requested for replacement of the product. But, the replaced product was not in good condition at all. I have returned all the keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle. However, the replaced product which I got today looks like the original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle were missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement.  I need to apply for replacement again which is really annoying. I think whoever from Amazon is reviewing these comments should immediately act on it to get the good sealed product with good condition should be delivered on time."
5,"Very good and interesting product. The silence while typing is very weird initially cause the feeling of keys while typing is same. Only complaint would be that mouse is size small and not most ergonomic, but cant complain too much at this price point."
5,A good keyboard with silent touch and mouse with silent click as expected. So far working well. Hope it lasts well. The functioning of the keys is much better than the earlier Logitech model that I was using.Packet delivery was professional.
3,"It is actually a silent keyboard when compared to other regular keyboards. Although it has some sound though from the key travel, it's not loud enough to disturb anyone outside the room. I am using a full size keyboard after years and it's actually quite comfortable after you get used to it.I do not like the mouse at all. It's not ergonomic design so using it for long working sessions is very uncomfortable. But that's least of the problems. The mouse hangs between two monitors which is very annoying. I have tried adjusting the settings but this problem hasn't resolved."
5,To unleash the full potential download Logitech Options software from Logitech to customize the mouse buttons and actions. To customize keyboard download Karabiner-Elements and you can map all the keys.Overall the experience is splendid and the keys are great for typing!!
5,"Logitech MK295 wireless keyboard and M220 wireless mouse combo is a great buy in terms of product quality. Buttons are really silent. This combo stands up to my expectation in terms of quality. I believe the Price is a little on higher side. If it could be priced in range of INR 1800 - INR 2000, it would make this product Superb value for money."
5,"I have used many logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the past, but this model is fun to use, just because of its silent feature. Many in the past has failed due to mouse click issues and dongle issues, hope this lives to the expectation."
5,"I was using mk275 logitech prior to this. Had a bad experience with that one, noisy keys, with couple of keys not working properly. Was skeptical about this one. BUT - this is an excellent keyboard. It really is silent! no noise. All keys have excellent feel, not missing any letters. It also has a capslock indicator. I would say its really a great keyboard and mouse combo. Go for it."
1,"the keyboard is great and very sleek and silent. but couple of keys not working when i used it. unfortunately i noticed the issue after the return window elapsed. now i am left with a keyboard without caps lock ,shift key and number 7"

5,"What a buy this was for a first Mechanical keyboard, Instantly feeling the difference in typing and gaming, took a couple days getting used to but since then the additional benefit is clear to be seen.I got it dirt cheap considering what it goes for usually, on the prime day sale.The RGB is exactly as everyone describes it , words don't do it justice.Typing is great too, zero to minimal fatigue to fingers even after 5-6 hours of continuous coding sessions, in love with the Cherry MX Speed switches.They don't even make any sound if you don't press a key all in.Would definitely recommend if you can afford to spend that much on  a keyboard!"
5,"I have been using this for last 3 months. Today 2nd April 2021 keyboard is extremely good. I use it every day( Monday to Friday) 10 hrs for all my office work. I never used it for gaming but i can say it is worth buying to have if you work in software industry. As a techi i always want to keep my tools at best to avoid health issues.Comfort is extremely good. Icu software to modify options are also user friendly. I have same company wireless mouse so i can modify options of both keyboard and mouse using same Icu software. I felt rs 17k is costly but after using this keyboard few months i am satisfied with the comfort and other best keyboard features, moreover it is one time investment for next 10 years in my case.I recommend it. I observed that this is high quality product. Everything including cables are also sturdy and strong.I will update again if I see any issues in coming months."
1,Product is awesomeBut there was no separate box and the original box was damaged along with dent at the side of keyboard. The seller ease e9 accessories.
5,"No other words to describe this beast of a keyboard. Buy the Cherry MX Brown version if you're looking to type and game with this. The braided cable with 2 USB type-A connectors is solid, so is the body. Comes with extra key-caps and key-remover. Packaging is premium. Keyboard on the whole is just a pleasure to type on. Amazon delivery quoted a later date but then got it well in advance. Retailer was Appario Retail (who can do a better job of packaging this thing - came with just an amazon white cover- not that it'll affect the build, but for a premium product, better packaging is expected-cardboard box with bubble-wrap at least). One of the best keyboards for gamers and programmers alike."
5,"Original price was 15k, I had my eyes on this and corsair k70 rgb since a month but I was waiting for a price drop in sale. Finally got this in republic sale for 11.5k (same price as k70). Honest advice if its not around 11-12k don't go for it, go for k70 instead. An led strip and 6 macro key are not worth 3k i think.If I talk about the quality and the feel, it's excellent.I have cheery mx brown switches. It is very silent and gives a nice tactile feedback. It feels like linear switches most of the time when you are typing fast, you will only feel a slight bump when you slowly press it.About rgb, oh man it will blows your mind. You can watch review videos on youtube for more info on this.There are not much logitech and razor keyword options in India. So this is next best thing.Highly recommend."
5,"The K95 Platinum RGB is the flagship keyboard by Corsair that represents the company's commitment to highest standards quality in P.C components industry, The cherry MX Speed switches are fast like really fast which is good for competitive Gaming, even gentle press are registered effortlessly. The RGB bling add flavour to my all corsair build powered by iCue, its gorgeous.The single peice alluminium body is quite sturdy that makes it quite bully like a laptop bulky.the double sided wrist rest feels nice but get dirty quite easily make sure to keep it clean regularly; the USB pass through is 2.0 not 3.0 or 3.1 which is unacceptable by 2019-2020 standards, while the braded cable is quite stiff making routing of the cable a tiresome job.The biggest con i believe the keyboard has the spacebar which tilt towards the pressing side sometimes and stay that way until manually removed and placed."

5,"This keyboard seems like a tank. Great sturdiness and chassis. Palm rest also feels planted when clipped with the board. Coming to the keys, I went for brown switches and damn it feels quality under hand. Perfect balance between silver speed and blue switches was all I wanted. It is Tactile, comfortable and fast enough.If you are a developer you surely will enjoy this. I feel the price is a mind blower for a lot out there but If you can afford it, you gonna feel the justification few years down the line and also I at my time of purchase k70 mk.2 was pretty close to this one, hence I got this. It's a flagship product, hence you'll get all glory of RGB and customisation. I hope corsair's service is also as nice as this keyboard is."
5,"Very nice keyboard, the shipping was also done surprisingly fast considering it is from US.- Its Macro keys are great, the Chery MX brown switches are a joy to use and the customizability from the CUE software is fantastic.- Reversible Wrist rest is good and decreases strain- The ""Gaming"" font is very ugly to look at, older K95 had a more sophisticated font."
4,"This is one crazy looking (Gun Metal version).You will fall in love at first sight.The quality, crazy font everything just perfectSomething which I wasn't comfortable and require some timeThose extra macro buttons change they way you use keyboard (I kept on hitting wrong keys)Mx Speed is too speedy to handle, miss that Mech keyboard feeling"
5,"If you've come till here, you've probably already seen a lot of videos on the features. I'll tell you every one of those are awesome. I got it during sale. I love those macros that I paid extra for (over k70 mk.2). I use this keyboard for gaming and for work too. Whenever I start working daily, there are a series of actions that I take everyday I start. Guess what? I have it on a macro and now all I do is press a button and all of it is done. I don't have to repeat it every single time now"
5,"Awesome keyboard for gaming. Key travel (cherry mx speed) for activation is very low so I'm not sure if it is suitable for everyone but for the ones who wants fast reactions without pressing your keyboard like a wild madman, this one is for you. Per key RGB is awesome. Customize the lighting to thr end of your imagination. Volume roller is a cool feature and I think all multimedia keyboards should have that... But then again that's what makes this one different. It's a little too expensive though. I got it for ₹10,999 on sale. If you have the greens (or any other digusting colors that our PM gave us) go for this one."
5,"One of the top selling keyboards worldwide, Feeling very comfortable with the palm rest and eye soothing beautiful RGBS, I bought MX cherry for both gaming and typing, Sound is very low, Loving to type :) Bought it for 12,999 INR, Wait for Amazon offers, They are the best."
5,"Awesome keyboard, the typing experience is truly amazing on this! The RGB colors are pretty cool. The keyboard is a little on the heavier side though"
5,"In my opinion the only thing that should be stopping you from getting this keyboard should be the price. Apart from the price, it is a fantastic keyboard. The cherry mx speed is such a pleasure to type. A solid investment should you want to get it. The build quality of the keyboard is top notch, you can feel the premium look."
4,"This is a great keyboard but highly overpriced. the Volume scroller broke within a few weeks, but the rest is all good. the Black keys are extremely fast and its only good for gaming. the color and light options are bloody amazing!"
5,The keyboard is just as advertised. Works very well and the setup is smooth.My only issue is with the seller and the packaging. The keyboard arrived with the box severely chipped and some keys out of place.
4,"The keyboard is such a freaking good build- good, but i found a flaw in space key. It's only useable from between cant use it from sides... Maybe its a problem with my item or..."
5,"Got my hands on this gold and I gotta say it's one of the best mechanical keyboards I've used. 9/10. You do have 3 memory slots onboard for the RGB but sadly you cannot change it to custom and overwrite using ICUE. Other than that, go for it if you got the money"
5,Awesome keyboard. Great feel and smooth operation.Perfect for day to day use. Lots of customisation options.
5,"Nice and sturdy keyboard, overpriced a bit, and not sure if thats due to the customs and all. complement my corsair LED mouse pad."
5,Beat key feedback always. Lights are awesome also silver buttons are just simply awesome but if you coming from red cherrys you hold on to this !! Rest are awesome just go for it !!
5,"Product is awesome but Packaging of products is horrible, Keyboard was totally open, main seal was broken like some one checked it and placed in box.For package i will give you 0 🌟"
5,Video Player is loading.
5,Awesome keyboard from Corsair and price worthy performance
4,The keyboard is awesome. But this Is the second time I am ordering the same. Both time the box which is in inside was torn badly and board was having little scratches at corners.one main con of this board is that the space bar rattles compared with Huperx alloys.
5,"Typing is very good and precise, thanks to cherry mx brown.RGB is fantastic.Satisfying clicks and media controls"
5,very good product
5,this product is really goodthe brushed aluminium finish makes it look premiumthe mx speed switches are very fast
3,This product is not good. These buttons are automatically removed for a little touch. can i able to change this keyboard?
5,Excellent Product...
5,Over priced for import! But a great delivery experience. Needless to say that it's the best keyboard in the market as of now
5,Awkward software and difficult to programming for RGB
5,Kids love it
5,Liked everything
4,Matel Fram bend depends upon your use.
5,"Typing this review on the K95 itself. The delivery was extremely fast (3 days) all the way from the USA. Now the keyboard i got was the gunmetal version with MX Speed switches and this thing means SPEED! The keys are extremely fast! It took me 2 days to get used to these keys but i have to say, they are amazing in gaming and typing as well! The keyboard itself is made out of brushed aluminum and is very heavy! The lights are rgb and look amazing! Overall the keyboard is very good but i still dont know why you would wanna pay 18K rs for it. I'm stupid rich so i bought this keyboard.... I love it so much :P"
5,"Earlier I was a bit skeptical about spending ₹6.5K for a keyboard and mouse (as I had to use it for a MacBook), but decided to give it a shot.To be honest I don't regret about a single rupee spent on it. The keyboard works great, and same with the mouseAnd I'm at loss of words about how much compatible these are with my MacBook, and the way these two work together, is really productive!The only setback I faced was that the left control and fn buttons were swapped, so that needed some getting used to.Also, the multiple device support is also coming in handy, so along with my laptop, I have a smartphone on a mobile holder, that I control with this combo, without having to take the phone in my hand, and breaking the keyboard-mouse combo flow."
1,"Keyboard :I have been in core IT for more than decade and used few different sets of the keyboards. found my self consistently mistyping and most annoyingly hitting the caplock Key. As most of the professionals get used to the Laptop keyboard mechanism, this may not suitable for them. Had Returned and ordered Logitech K480.Mouse :its M720 Triathlon.Its good mouse with Lot of Features and Ergonomic , will get used to it in day or 2.But keeping the Ergonomic, comfort, Portability and Price into the Consideration, have migrated to Logitech K480 and MX Master 2S would be best combination by adding the 1k.  if you are not in hurry to replace the mouse urgently would suggest to wait for sale to grab both of them for lesser Price."
4,"Combo consists of (m720 Triathlon mouse and mk850 mouse)#Mouse (is an M720 TRIATHLON)1. Works with Ubuntu 18.X version and one need to load the solaar software for this. (same for keyboard)2. Works well with the mac 0sX also. (Same for key board)#Keyboard(is a mk850)3. keyboard is just very smooth .. needs a little time to get adjusted. once done its a beauty.4. for a programmer it is way beautiful since i am a mostly Unix/linux  flavour OS user, which means i am a terminal addict.5. Mac OSX functionality is also present which will only make the life much easy for any programmer,6. one thing which i find is the volume control ( which i have to check on Mac yet )7. I have not found much to nitpick as of now.Suggestions for people may if you work with multiple devices purchase one more unified reciever for the the other device since BT would consume more power.  It would cost arround 550 Rs and give a much  better controll."
1,"3 Months of Usage:Typos on account of spongy keystrokes continue to afflict efficiency on a day-to-day basis.Caps Lock key has the worst feel. One could open the keyboard and clean up the guides in the back tray. But at this price range, it should not be needed.Saving up for a Kinesis Split or Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard now.I am a bit put off by the experience of an item with such a high mark up for being a luxury item.-----Initial:The keystrokes are very spongy. Keys take a long time to return to the original position (in vertical travel). This causes more errors in typing. It also distracts oneself when trying to work on some coding since the backspace is so soft and spongy. I hope it clears up this feel in days to come. If so, I will update the feedback after 3 months."
4,"Liked: Keys give an almost silent  assuring tactile feedback. Keys placed  in a raised comfortable manner, pleasure to type with this keyboard. Adjustable height, good palm rest.Not liked: High cost of keyboard, Rs 5999/-!!! There is no print-screen key!! Or if there is a keyboard shortcut I am not aware of it.Overall a good keyboard. Four stars because of above shortcomings. I don't know how long will it last . With such cost it should last for several years without another urge to change this keyboard also."
4,"Pros:1. Stylish. Goes well with Office/Gaming Setup.2. Very easy to setup with both Windows/Mac3. Customization software available to configure mouse and keyboard buttons.4. Ergonomic design.5. Strong bluetooth connection. Dongle given for non-bluetooth devices.6. Switching device is a breeze.7. Keys have both Windows and Mac key names in them (Ctrl vs Command etc).8. Can do file transfer between systems.Cons:1. When moving the mouse too fast, you may hear batteries roll. Not expected from this model.2. Back side of the Keyboard and mouse feels flimsy because of the white plastic. A grey or black would have been better choice.3. Keyboard keys are too soft if you are upgrading from a mechanical keyboard. Not a big deal but takes some time to get used to.Having said that, completely recommended for anyone who works with multiple devices and don't want to spend on MX Keys/MX Master."
1,"I bought the product on 29 Jan 2019 fascinated by the features it provided. My first costly investment in a high-end keyboard and a mouse.Starting with mouse, the left click doesn't work smoothly anymore. Have to hit it very hard for it to work.Some of the keys don't work on the keyboard. Plus the lights of 1/2/3 doesn't work.Apart from this connectivity issue started crawling from very early.p.s.: And here I am again to buy a new pair. Definitely this time will buy something more basic so that it doesn't hurt when it stops working. In a nutshell, fancy features but not that durable."
1,"500 rs mouse would have worked longer than this. And now I have to take this to a walk in center which is almost 100 kms away from me to get it replaced. When you pay this much for a keyboard and mouse, one would expect it to work without any issues longer than this."
5,"The price tag might seem to be a bit high - but you can go for it blindly if you are ready to spend for a comfortable  and ergonomic combo.Pros:1. Seamless switching capability between multiple devices.  Works very well with my office Lenovo Windows laptop and Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Android tablet.2. Keyboard's curved design is very ergonomic.  You will appreciate the design once you start using.3. No need of a USB dongle for connectivity for first two devices you pair.  If you need the third device to be connected simultaneously to the first two, only then you will need to use the dongle provided along.4. Mouse is well contoured for your right hand.  Left hand users should stay away - don't buy.4. Additional buttons on the mouse are completely configurable.  There are 3 such buttons (one set similar to the usual forward/backward buttons and the other an almost hard to notice button called Gesture button)5. Keyboard is 80-90% silent while usage, but has adequate key travel.  I felt that the Enter key doesn't have key travel like the other keys - this might improve over time perhaps.6. The middle click wheel of mouse has a toggle button to switch between ultra smooth and ratchet mode which is a very welcome feature.Cons:1. Mouse right click and left click aren't quiet.  I felt this should've been taken care especially when Logitech already have M221 which is way too cheaper to own in their range which is ultra silent.2. No Backlit functionality for keyboard - this isn't a big complaint though.  I understand the difficulty to manage battery life on a wireless keyboard."
1,"I bought this because I use multiple machines with shared monitor. I liked the the multi device capability and bought this. However keyboard is bad. It's keys were plasticky. ""H"" key was not getting registered most of the time. I had to hit it hard to make it work. Its a membrane keyboard with weird bump in the middle in the name of ergonomics. I think the shape is the cause of the inconsistent activation pressure required across the keys. Mouse is fine and device switching worked fine during limited period I used this keyboard.I couldn't get the replacement I was in the middle of the shifting. Dumb amazon service couldn't get the addresses updated even after multiple calls. Amazon service is also becoming pathetic as it takes long time to speak to customer service representative and then most of them will give you same solutions thats available on website. I think Amazon has truly become number one courier company as there is no product/service ownership. Overall distasteful experience. Substandard product paired with even pathetic customer service."
4,"Tl;drExcellent mouse if you are right-handed, excellent keyboard if you use number keysPros:1. Good design. Not sure if it is as ergonomic as it claims to be, but any day better than a macbook keyboard.2. Key travel is satisfying. Minimal errors.3. The device switching speeds and reliability is excellent4. Logi options software is amazing, letting your customize both your keyboard and mouse to make you forget your trackpad.5. Fast scroll in the mouse is a godsend if you are a programmer and your colleagues are fans of monolith code: can scroll through thousands of lines of code in milliseconds.6. Though AA and AAA batteries in 2021 can be considered a con, can also be considered a pro in a world where all you don't have to remember to charge is yourself.Cons:1. Plasic body. Though has no flex, at 6.5k, leaves something to be desired.2. The bent shape of the keyboard, makes it harder to lug around in your backpack.3. Logitech should offer a 10key less option for this. If you use dual monitor setup, your desk might not be enough for the mouse.4. No backlight. Though can give a concession since it came out in 2016 and is wireless."
4,"Firstly, the packaging includes a USB miniature dongle referred to as 'Unifying Receiver' which is a is a small dedicated USB wireless receiver, based on the nRF24L-family of RF devices, that allows up to six compatible Logitech human interface devices to be linked to the same computer using 2.4 GHz band radio communication.  The 'Unifying Receiver' is tucked away in the product packaging and can be easily missed out. There is a receptacle made for it within the mouse body for storage. Ordinarily you don't need the receiver because the mouse-keyboard combo work great on Bluetooth, and therefore you are liable to ignore it's utility and lose it with the packaging. Bought seperately it costs as much as the mouse-keyboard combo. I had a hard time trying to tell Amazon Customer Support that it was missing even though the packaging details referred to its inclusion. I almost gave up at Amazon insistence that the component was not s part of the combo product until I intuitively checked the unboxing video for the product on YouTube."
5,"Well I after I received product I saw amazon packaging seal was broken as well as main box package seal was also broken but luckily product was untouched inside it, if only inside packe seal broken instead both then i would have been replaced product as it will be meaning refurbished product, but since both delivery and inner package seal broked I assumed some one definitely opened and saw what is the product inside it,Any way I tested both keyboard and moise and I'm relly happy with purchased, it is really seamless access the device, i connect two laptop and one mobile and so far no complaints no issuesBut for sure amazon should be really careful with their delivery services"
4,"So here's my review of this keyboard and mouse.Mouse :One word for it, Awesome.Pros:1. Feels brilliant when you hold it2. Has loads of features.3. All additional buttons can be customised.4. Very handy overall.Cons:1. Doesn't really look fancy.Keyboard :Pros:1. Features are fantastic.2. Very ergonomic.Cons:1. No tactile feedback2. Typing feels mushyPersonally i dont like the keyboard but now I'm stuck with it cuz amazon doesn't give refund.I'd rather ask people to buy G213 keyboard and buy the mouse separately.I'll update the review after using the keyboard for a while. Let's see if I get used to it."
5,As you can see im using it with my macbook pro via the Bluetooth media. The unified device also works but i needed to free some port hence the Bluetooth connection. There was not lag that i got using the product. I also simultaneously use it on my android mobile and the connection switches effortlessly. In fact im typing this reveiwing using the keyboard. Amazon devlivered the product on time. All in all im very happy with the product its comfortable and easy to use on my macbook and android phone. Highly recoomended
5,"My old Logitech MK 250 left click was not working after 1 year of extensive use wanted a new one and bought this after a lot of research,Excellent Keyboard and mouse combo,Very comfortable and value for money,Blue tooth pairing is a bliss was able to connect my android smart TV box with this as well ,Very satisfied, If you are looking for a multipurpose luxury keyboard go for this, Ordered Microsoft- had to ship from US to India and was to take a long time canceled it as found this updated new model beauty in India and bought it immediately, Awesome delivery by Amazon prime got the product in 1 day.Just buy it highly recommending it."
5,"I went for this combo for the following reasons:1. It is multi-device compatible which means you can use it with Windows/Mac as well as your Android/iOS devices.2. It has both Bluetooth and a single unifying receiver: You can either use Bluetooth or the dongle receiver that is provided in the box to connect the devices. This is a nice thing to have as you don't have to depend on the dongle and the need to have usb-A ports on the device you want to connect it with.3. The Logitech Options app is just brilliant. You can use it to check device status like battery and customise various functions of your mouse and keyboard to the next level.4. I was in need of only a keyboard but the mouse has been quite a big upgrade from my older plug and play mouse. I just can't stop using the hyperscroll wheel and it's other buttons to quickly access various functions like opening control centre or copying and pasting too! This is also an optical mouse that uses infrared as opposed to laser and is more accurate and has a great ergonomic design as well.5. The palm rest on the keyboard has also come in handy and has a good feel to it.I do face some lag/connection issues once in a while, but it's not something that bothers me very frequently.Overall it's a great buy and I have been completely satisfied with the purchase."
3,"Smooth keys and mouse. The angular design of the keyboard provides ergonomic comfort.June 28, 2020: I’ve been having trouble with this combo keyboard and mice and after some research I figured that I was missing the unifying receiver. For some reason I never thought of checking in the past year or so but after adding a windows PC the combo kit was freezing every few minutes. With the MacBook it need a bit of nudging to get them to work again. Finally I was looking for answers and figure that the unifying receiver could improve the performance and boy i was right a bit too late. The unifying receiver has been sitting in the box for the past 12 months or so and today after plugging it in it’s working without any issues. Will be watching it’s performance over the next few days.Don’t connect using inbuilt or external Bluetooth dongle. Use the unifying receiver.It surely is a bit complicated to use but if you learn about all the features and use the software Logitech Options and use the Unifying receiver it should solve most set up teething issues."
4,"I purchased this around the 5/6k mark which was way above it's nearest competitor at 2k. I did this so as to better assure a good quality wireless keyboard/mouse combo for playing PC games on the TV. The keyboard has a soft cushion at the bottom and the keys all feel top quality. The mouse feels good in the hand and is easily customisable. The issue is that the keyboard is a little fragile. Once, the keys were not responsive and only responded once I  flexed the keyboard a little. I don't think I should be able to do this thus my comments regarding it's potential fragility."
4,"This is a very good product. I have two laptops at my home and I need to keep switching between them regularly. This keyboard is just so so useful and the Logitech Flow works seamlessly, albeit with the slightest bit of lag. It is almost magical how both the mouse and keyboard just shift between laptops.The only flaw I can find in it is that if I connect my office laptop to the VPN, then I cannot use Logitech Flow to switch between my devices. I have to then use the number buttons on the keyboard and mouse to switch between my devices. But, that is a very very minor inconvenience.The keyboard is also very comfortable.Note that if you do not have multiple devices, then it is better to look for an alternate configuration ( See this: https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B06X3YC1MD)."
4,"I would say for this price this is a good enough combo for normal purpose use.If you are someone who just does browsing watches videos uses mouse more than using keyboards. This is the product for you.But for the people like me(software engineers, coders, content writers, etc ) looking for a great typing experience will be hugely dissappointed.Though the mouse is quite pleasant to use and has fast scroll wheel like mx masters 3. As well as good ergonomics and feel.So if you are ready to make a slight compromise with the keyboard i would say go ahead with this combo."
4,Liked the keyboard in general as it functions quite well though the keys themselves feel too soft. The thing that I dislike most about all Logitech keyboards are there rather flimsy risers that they have at the back. They break at the slightest of pressures rendering the risers useless. And you can’t even order replacements.
4,"I had my doubts - One keyboard - three devices and not to mention - And yes - it is Pricey! But works !!!I did have an initial issue in connecting - that was resolved in a few minutes - but after that was a breeze.. Connecting my laptop, phone and desktop...The one thing I miss compared to the previous one i had was the holding slot for the phone - but hey - this is better....And yes - The mouse works only on one device - either the laptop or the desktop... switching from one to two - does not move the mouse, even if you try to shift the mouse connections - so you might need to keep a spare mouse for the desktop - unless it is a Pad / Phone... Or unless I am missing something"
5,"VALUE FOR MONEY! I was looking for a multi device keyboard and mouse for a long time with moderate budget and finally hands on this one! Simple and elegant.Keyboard may look outdated. Hey come on! Its Practical. And that's what I need.Mouse! I love MX Master 3 and i wanted it but its expensive. But this M720 mice almost satisfied my need. Not so cool as MX Master! But yeah, it's Practical.Keyboard bulge makes little more comfort for typing. The wrist rest pad make it more easier. Practical, right?Mouse holding position is Perfect.I have connected with 3 of my devices (Details below with spec. and their purpose with me. I think its too much of showing off!

4,"Pro: ability to instantly switch between 3 devices. Custom programable keys can be configured to perform different functions in different applications. Like custom key 1 in outlook can be configured to perform a specific step and the same button can perform a different function in photoshopCon: It's a shame that the keyboard not back lit. Such an expensive device missing one of the basic features like eyboard back light,doesn't justify the cost."
5,"I really liked the product. Before I had this USB switcher and I used to switch from office laptop to personal laptop with a button on it. my table setup was messed up with all the wires.With this wireless and multi device keyboard, I was able to get rid of almost 5 set of wires. With my office setup I am using the transmitter that came in, setup is pretty easy. just connect the transmitter and it gets configured to switch 1 on keyboard.I don't experience any lag or slowness in mouse even though its wireless.For personal laptop I used the bluetooth connection and configured at switch 2 (Had to install logitech options software on personal laptop for this). Switch 3 is unused.Even with bluetooth it works pretty smoothly.DrawbacksEnter key is bit small, takes time to get used to itNo light for numlock (probably they wanted to save battery with this)The bottom part is more dust prone"
5,"Excellent Keyboard and Mouse combo , this product is really gem considering its pricing, when i ordered i am skeptical about the performance of this combo set but it created an addiction within three days of use, and today when i am using logitech's old combo set , it remind me how pathetic the old combo is , but  it is not the old keyboard , but this new keyboard help me in my productivity."
3,"I will definitely say that its is easy top connect and the design suits your daily needs. But beware of below things:1. If you are using it regularly the buttons will tend to get stuck. While checking my outlook mails, I clicked the delete button once and it started deleting others as the button was stuck.2. I also use it for PC, so it doesn't work when you are installing fresh windows. Which is expected, so always have a wired one handy."
4,"The keyboard and mouse both are performing as expected. The only thing was that I had to change the battery inside mouse. I use it along with a MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini. It’s very easy to switch between the devices.In Bluetooth mode, they are working without any lag.Only con I can find is that if you need a clicky feel in your keyboard, then this keyboard may not be for you. And that’s why I have reduced a star from the rating."
5,"This wireless keyboard and mouse are very versatile and easy to customize with the software that can be downloaded from Logitech. The design is very ergonomic, and the battery usage seems to be more efficient than other devices. The keyboard is so silent that you won't feel that you are actually typing something and it comes with a waist support that is also helpful for long run work. The soft cushion will give you extra comfort everytime. Apart from this, it comes with dedicated shortcuts like Calculator, screenshot and with every function you will be notified on the screen. The white colour numerical is for multiple devices. Easy to instal with any devices, just hold any of these white colour swithces for 3 secs.Mouse: This is superb in class and easily fits in the hand. Good for editing works and coding work. It comes with super smooth scroller function and switches for multiple device connection. Switches can be customised through logitech application.Both of the devices comes with separate on and off switches and with a single adapter. Although, if your device have in built Bluetooth, doesn't need to connect with the adapter. Both of these devices are good for long run and comes with AAA batteries which can be changed laterWorks fine with windows and Mac Book Pro and air ( has dedicated key for Mac as well as for windows)Only cons is that they are not providing usb extender as mentioned in the box."
4,Pros -1) Keyboard is very comfortable and hand support is amazing2) Keys are amazing and perfect for office work3) Mouse design is brilliant and works on any surface and both can be connected to 3 devices4) I used with macBook Pro and bluetooth connection is seamless5) Scrolling of mouse is amazing6) Low noise keyboard and quality of material is such that it does not accumulate dirt7) Keyboard has back stand of 2 sizesCons -1) No backlit2) Side scroller in mouse would have been great3) Mouse could have been slightly lighterCan't comment on battery life yet
5,Logitceh always offer best in class product for computeing need this set of MK 850 Performance Keyboadd & Mice Combo is nothing less it is a fantastic product but offered on little higher price point but nothing to complain about as it is Logitech product it is good package and having good typing experience they call it combo but the have combined two different products K850 Keyboard & M720 Mice but they are good.
1,"Got it today. Connected to first device. Mouse and keyboard works throuth the unified usb device. Connected keyboard through bluetooth to second device. Even though i press second key in mouse, it doesnt connect to second device. Tried pressing all buttons on mouse. Mouse doesnt connect to other devices. It always sticks to first device. All logitech documentation says install software. I cant install in my office laptop.. :( struggled 2 hours finally gave up and returning it."
5,Ergonomic keyboard and mouse with sturdy yet soft keys. The scissor keys effect is visible in the key output. The mouse is silent with a mellow click and is super efficient. I use it on my work laptop so can't possibly use the logitech software to pair my phone as well but am super happy with this investment
5,"Very fine button quality on both keyboard and mouse. I have purchased more than 7 wireless keyboard/mouse combo within 3 years but not even Logitech's other products under 5k could beat this one.Integrates with my Gaming laptop, M1 Macbook and OnePlus 9 Pro all at once with easy switching capability. Has 3 device switching buttons.Didn't tested on iPad but should support that too."
4,"I have been using this for almost 2 months now. It has been a good addition to my WFH arsenal. I have always loved the feel of typing with a mechanical keyboard. The keys may work a little different if you're using Mac, but still works seamlessly once you get a hold of it. It is a much better deal for those who do not use Mac's 2/3 finger gestures, because if you do, you might want to switch to magic mouse, which is a deep hole into your pockets.Performance wise, I have noticed minor lag every now and then while using mouse but this goes off when you remove/replug the bluetooth adapter.So far, i am satisfied with the sturdy build and overall performance for the bucks that i have spent."
4,Long Hua Switches..
1,Lung Hua switches not Cheery MX Blue FAKE
5,"Check the images I uploaded, especially the comparison with HP K100. In fact, there is no comparison of HP 100 with this keyboard. Because that is of 500 bucks and this one is five times costlier than that. The size of TVS Gold Bharat USB wired is big enough. More than it would have been awkward and uncomfortable.In looks, the keyboard is sturdy, solid and strong and in operation, it is soft and melodic key typing sounds. It is not noise if one likes the keyboard and if not then the sound is noise and size is absurd.I urge the sellers to upload the product images so that the customer could have a good look of product from angles to make the decision to buy. I also urge my fellow customers to please upload product images for being helpful to others. Hope mine will help someone else.The keyboard is as good as shown on the webpage in the product image. I thought the model must be older. But to my surprise, it is manufactured in Feb. 2020. Above all TVS electronics is Karnataka based company which make this keyboard an Indian product so on that count also I feel good to have this.It is with a USB keyboard. MRP is Rs. 2770 and I got at Rs. 2568/- as Appario Retail was selling more than it.Only thing i fear is that the colour of keywords on keys is less bright compared to other but that do not affect it's working.My views are that the product must go on for years and for such a product some cost has to be paid. I have two other regular mechanical keyboards lighter in weight and good performance, but this one has no comparison. This keyboard is not a 'use and throw' hardware. As I said it will get old with me. Hopefully I will need another mechanical keyboard in year 2030. Get it and forget to purchase any keyboards for years to come."
1,"I wish to return the item as it is a low quality item and nothing close to what a ""classic"" original TVS Mechanical keyboard should be. It has some inferior quality switches (Lung Hua make) and not the Cherry MX Switches that the original classic make used. This item was delivered on 22 June but I could check the item only today as I was out of town and due to COVID lockdown there were no options to reach home earlier. I reached home today in the morning and today in the afternoon I opened the item and I am not happy with the product and hence want to return. But unfortunately the return window closed yesterday and Amazon would not allow me to return the item. I request the seller to take a note and help me with a possible return."
4,"I had to return this keyboard.Just for context I use a CoolerMaster keyboard with cherry MX brown switches. I needed another keyboard for office but was looking for a cheaper alternatives with mechanical switches.This keyboard provided a great typing experience given the price point but I had to return it because it didn't matched three of my usecases.1. It's very big and bulky, it takes up a lot of real estate on my table where i keep dozen other things.2. The Chinese blue switches were pretty awesome in typing but very loud for my office use.3. The backspace button was small, I use it a lot and prefer it wider like in other standard layouts.Although the built quality is not that sturdy and can easily flex but i felt pretty confident that it would last long.Overall i would suggest to give this keyboard a try as it provides great typing experience with good tactile feedback without burning a hole in your pocket. It just didn't workout for my usecase."
2,"I was bit apprehensive since the key switches are not from original cherry mx manufacturers. However it turns out that the keys do have good tactile feedback and true mechanical feel. Happy with the purchase. Feels solid and durable.The only thing which bothers me is the missing Fn key. It should be possible to map the ""Menu"" key to ""Fn"" key using OS specific key mapping software ... but that will be a hassle. That is the only reason it has lost 1 star.EDITED ON 9 Feb 2021The key ""R"" was giving problems for past few months, I had to apply extra pressure to make it work and today it stopped working completely! I bought this on 12 Feb 2020, so I have 3 more days to claim 1 year manufacturer warranty but there is no TVS service center in my town and not sure if it is even worth it. The cherry MX like keyswitches are not user replaceable and local shop could not repair it. Though there is no issue with all other keys, I was hoping to replace the defective key with one of the number pad keyswitch but it is not designed that way. One important reason to buy mechanical keyboard is it's reliability too but looks like the keyswitches used are not high quality cherry MX switches but of some low quality. So I have reduced my rating to 2 stars."
5,"You will not get disappointed with this product ever. It has the best keys with a spring action. If you are a stock market trader or have a habit of pressing the keyboard with a heavy hand, you will love this product. I have been using TVS key board for the last 10 years and they simple awesome.  The Millenials may not like it as they are used to laptop keyboard which are soft."
5,"I was bought this for my employees. I thought it is a budget keyboard nothing fancy.But the performance is truly amazing. I never expected this much smooth. It is looks like old IBM keyboard.Previously I tried Redgear brown switch Kailh, Zebronics max pro blue - outemu switch.This TVS gold is absolutely fantastic.The design of the keyboard slightly curved in the middle is so good to type.I recommend for who used to coding a lot & typing large amount of text everyday.  I am enjoyed so much."
5,"One of the best mechanical keyboards at the price. It is clickety / clackly - ma not be great for really quiet offices, but just right for home use, the tactile response is just amazing. This is my second TVSE keyboard, the controller chip died on the previous one, and buying a new one is simpler than getting the controller chip replaced - AND yes, it will end up either in the plastic recycle bin or on a landfill somewhere.For the moment, am holding on to the old one, to see if I can replace the chip, when I have some time on my hands.Great for casual gaming as well !"
1,"There is no serial number mention in bill copy, Now the one Keyboard got errors, in service centre they asking for serial number In bill without that you cannot claim warranty like wise it comingI need solution"
1,"Duplicate product received, this is not cherry me blue product. This is Long Hua keys product which means clone of Cherry MX blue... Please Amazon sell only original genuine product. We trust you..."
5,"I was doing good research on keyboard for my mac However among all others options and choices my decisions were turning towards this keyboard only.. reason were, i have used it personally 10 yrs back, smooth cherrymax and click sound and long lasting it is.The challenge was, how will i use it with my Mac.  Since there are not much reviews around mac usage and secondly it is already popular for windows among others mechanical keyboards. So i did bit more digging, bought 2 connecters 1st for multi usb purpose and 2nd with type c port to connect to mac... And voilla this approch worked. Once arrived, have connected without any issue and it worked like charm for me. Additionally have changed windows key to cmd key which let me use it like normal mac keyboard. I am happy and feel comfortable in using the same.Thanks!"
5,"The legendary TVS GOLD is i believe one of the most widely distributed mechanical keyboards out there. This specific one that i got has Longhua switches and a small backspace button, so you will need a few days to get used to it. The pressure needed to press the switches is around 40grms, So you will feel very comfortable typing on it if you are upgrading from a membrane (or god forbid one of those chicklet style keyboards) All in all the keyboard feels heavenly and it comes with a pretty solid warranty as well, covered by TVS electronics. I would buy it again in a hearbeat."
4,NOT COMPARABLE  TO ALL SYSTEMS SOME KEYS DOES NOT WORK  AND OLD PATTERN DOES NOT WORK ON NEW SYSTEMS
5,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON IN 3 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ORDER. PACKING IS NOT GOOD FROM THE CONCERN. BUT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD AND NEW ONE. IAM A PROFESSIONAL TYPE WRITER. WORKING IN SYSTEM FOR LONG TIME IN EVERY DAY. MEMB' KEYBOARDS ARE NOT GOOD FOR TYPING. SO I SEARCH A GOOD MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FROM LONG TIME. FINALLY I FOUND THIS KEYBOARD RECENTLY. TYPING EXPERIENCE IS SO GOOD, KEYS ARE VERY STRONG. BUT ONLY THE PROBLEM, BACKSPACE KEY IS VERY SMALL. IT'S LOOKS LIKE A 90s KEYBOARDS LIKE IBM. OVER ALL I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THANKS TO TVS"
5,"I have two of these. The first one I bought many years ago and it is my primary keyboard and comes with the original blue Cherry MX switches.The second one I purchased for my parent's house when I am visiting and need to work from there. These are the Long switches and some folks have complained but I haven't been able to make out any difference in normal use.The keyboard is very clickety and works really well. Rugged. The original TVS gold keyboard I am using I purchased in 2016.For this price point, this is a solid, mechanical keyboard with made-in-india to boot. Will recommend it."
1,"I have used this product earlier. The keyboard itself works fine. But there is a catch. TVS has shipped a warranty registration card along with the product. To claim warranty, you have to post this card after writing your address and contact number.I am least interested in providing my contact details to TVS just to use the product. Also, TVS may reject warranty claims if this card is not posted. If the seller had written about it prominently on Amazon page, I would not buy the product at all."
5,"The TVS box packing looked little a bit beaten up but the keyboard itself looks like unused. Coming from a membrane keyboard, the feeling is amazing. My typing speed has improved by at least 10% compared to the membrane keyboard verified by typing speed test. This is the Long Hua blue switches.Works good on Mac but the numlock, printscreen, left click buttons doesn't seem to do anything on Mac. Scrolllock acts as screen brightness down, pause acts as brightness up. Maybe we can remap using USB Overdrive app in Mac. The backspace button is a bit smallIt is a joy to type on but might be noisy while typing in Zoom, Google Meets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Found Karabiner which remaps the unused keys in Mac and setting noise cancellation to max in zoom actually cancels all keyboard sounds"
2,Received a used product. Warranty sticker was removed and the body looked used and damaged. I had ordered the same product before and was satisfied with it. However for the second order received a probably used one. The keys do not make a clicking sound. I wouldn't recommend.
5,"Hello Friends ,I tried 3 keyboards before settling down on this one.1. Zebronics max pro :2. Cosmic byte - CB-GK-13 brown switch .3. TVS gold bharat :out of three, tvs is just the best .I was looking for keyboard only for work purpose i.e coding/programming.This keyboard is just best. don't think, just go for it. you won't regret it."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Definitely hands down the best budget mechanical keyboard in the market. It's really good for its price. The typing feels awesome and can't stop till fingers hurt. Not a great one for gaming but purely for typing.
5,"I am using this key board for a couple of weeks and it is ok ; only with a longer use can I give a proper review. But the reason why I bought this, is because my dad uses a similar TVS Gold keyboard, which he bought in 1996 and it is still working perfectly fine. That’s 24 years! Made in India rocks!"
1,If you want a good mechanical keyboard without any freaking RGB stuff and gimmicks then go for it earlier i was using tvs gold prime with cherry mx red so it was obvious that after using that tvs keyboard would be my next choice but the seller is selling it way above mrp its actual mrp is 2100 but i got it for 2700₹ that's not fair but still tvs is a good brand with good service get the warranty extension by buying the 1 year warranty extension plan from tvs for 150₹ only .Note from 2018 onwards tvs has started using long hua Chinese clons of cherry mx but still they are great.Edit reviewThis keyboard stopped working within replacement days i have ordered the replacement version hope so it comes fine rest i will update :)
1,"Don’t buy this compromised product. I had requested for return and refund, but Amazon did a replacement. I am not going to use it just because amazon thinks my problem was with the particular piece. These are made from substandard materials."
1,"Within six months keys stop working. It's not doing any action on keypress. After spending Rs 2675, working like this then it's not value for money. Very disappointed by TVS Gold :("
5,"Once you use this, you will never downgrade back to non mechanical keyboard. Most affordable mechanical keyboard and most importantly its made in India by an Indian company.  Now I feel people and companies should buy only mechanical keyboards as it lasts long and increases productivity. You look forward to type rather than avoiding. Brings joy to typing."
1,"I have just wasted my Rs. 2600 on this item, as no local service center is available and serial number mismatch on invoice and product, and Amazon CC executives were behaving rudely and told me that i should have checked serial number on delivery. So beware of this seller."
5,"My father is using this keyboards for years and so I also replaced my new keyboard with this very expensive TVS Gold. To be honest, you will notuse ANY keyboard once you will try this. This is almost immortal and amazing keyboard for extensive users. Highly recommend."
1,"I am utterly disappointed by the product. There is no click on the P key and the print is wearing off on frequently used keys after just ~20 days of use.I paid ~2700+ for this keyboard when cheaper keyboards were available, and didn't deserve this."
4,Good quality keyboard. Definitely the you can get at this price point. The only problem I faced is that is layout is different than most laptop keyboards these days. In particular the \ key and Ctrl key are placed to differently that I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also it is a bit too big.
5,"buyed this for working with zbrush software.there is no ghosting issues.keys are soft,and you can hear a clicky satisfying sound like the sound from we click on mouse.i also wanted the numberpad,because in blender,i can rotate the viewport,so it comes handy.i also found that they test every single keyboard and add a sticker on the back of the keyboard,and tick it with a pen.nice build quality also.the problem i faced that my desk tray doesn't fit this keyboard.so i rebuild my desk for this keyboard to fit in.and this keyboard also have a classic vibe and aesthetically pleasing.i hope my review is helpful to you😇"
5,Keys are very soft now I can type more than 50 wpm I do typing daily for more than 3 hrs. I would recommend for those who wants to type faster and for thosewho types daily for  more than 1 hour
3,"comfortable but very noisy, due to lower quality of switches used the TVS seems to have stopped using the high quality cherry keys and opted for cheaper chinese version.TVS seems to have lowered the standards and raised prices."
3,"TVS Gold is always all-time favorite KB for developers, yes the quality is not that good compare to what TVS used to produce in older times. But in the current market TVS KB is the best option.only one issue from the amazon supplier, I got the physical GST bill of someone else in package."
4,Nothing can beat the clippity clappity of a mech keyboard and this one does that just fine. The keyboard is however very clunky. I was surprised with the size of the kb when I opened the packing to be honest. I would have preferred something much too smaller but I couldn't find any tkl at that price. Overall a good buy.
3,"Read it properly. This keyboard is a great stealth keyboard for typing and normal use but for gaming, it is not suitable. I have had the worst issue. One of the main features for a keyboard mainly for RPG games, the anti-ghost feature is not available here, which means you can not use 3 keys simultaneously while gaming i.e if you sprint using W + SHIFT key then you cannot jump using SPACEBAR or any other key. I have faced it in Assassins creed and PUBG where you have to jump heavily while running. So make proper research before you buy a normal keyboard for gaming. I had no idea about this feature earlier. And as per amazon policy, you can't get a refund, only a replacement. So you will be trapped. Apart from this, it's a good keyboard for typing and normal use."
5,"I bought it for Rs. 450. The printed price is Rs. 649.This is a soft keyboard.Pros-1. The build quality is excellent.2. The keyboard is a soft keyboard. It means that there is no space for the dust to go inside the keyboard. The space between the buttons is filled by the plastic cover. (as shown in the pics).3. It has all the required buttons.4. The number-pad is given at the right side which is an additional advantage.5. The buttons are extremely soft and easy to press.6. The cable is also very good and lengthy. It is around 1.5m long.7. There are two stands provided at the bottom (one at left and one at right). You can use these stands and thus make is somewhat inclined in order make its use more comfortable.8. The lights for Numlock, Capslock, Scroll lock are provided. These light in white color and are quite bright.9. Less chance for dust collection in the keyboard as there is not much space for the dust to go inside.Cons-1. The keyboard is way too soft. If you are a hard keyboard user then initially you'll face some difficulty using it. It may happen quite often that you press any key for on letter and the same letter may get printed more than 2 times. So if you are a traditional keyboard user (hard keyboard user) then you need a few days to get used to it.This is actually not a con because this is somewhat advanced design.2. Somewhat costly. You can get some cheap keyboard in local market but obviously the quality of those is nowhere close to this one.Final comment- If you want to purchase a keyboard for a laptop or PC and if you can afford it, it is the best available choice in the market. Go for it without thinking twice."
3,"This sleekly designed keyboard comes with chiclet styled keys (keys with low height, like on the iMacs or laptops). I went for this design because of the low key height, so that even if they get hard with dust later on, the low height will make it less stressful to press.. The narrow design of the keyboard is good for making it fit in small space. There are small, sleek indicator lights on num/cap/scroll locks.However, on the negative side, the keys double press for fast typists like me. I have to correct a lot of my typing once I am done using this keyboard. Another problem are the media keys that rely on ""function"" keys. You can activate them for the session permanently by pressing a combination of the FN and ESC, but that doesn't remain after restarts, and also makes the actual F9–F12 keys secondary.For the cost spent, this is a decent keyboard, but not as great as other reviews make it out to be."
1,"I've been using this for a year. The keys were soft when it was new. Over the months, the keys slowly became hard. It was gradual so it was difficult to notice the change until my finger tips started paining and I realised that it's because of the hard keys. This product has around 4.5 rating. I am guessing all have reviewed after purchase and not updated after a year of use!"
1,"The keyboard is of cheap quality, the cheapness is to the extent of keys getting struck all the time. I am very disappointed for the value I am receiving. I am sure such a cheap quality can't be unnoticeable to users and even getting to think that if Amazon is manipulating user reviews to trick buyers go for products which are not worthy of buying. The review ratings are like a joke now."
2,"#Design:Noting to say here we can see what is in the picture it's almost same, although I expected little slimmer like my laptop, it is double the height of my laptop keys, (I had added an image for its real comparison)I went for this design because of the low key height, so that it will be less stressful to press.but here comes the twist after use of 2-3 month the ctrl button becomes very hard and it slows down my typing speed,to press the ctrl button, need to press on the centre of the button if you try to click on the corner it will not press even if you put all the pressure you have in your little finger.#Problems I face (issue)1. buttons not slim as expected2. some buttons get very hard which need extra attention while typing.#Openion / Summarydon't buy if you want something slim and soft button to work,No issue if you only want to play games or not a regular user."
1,"Given the Brand's name I bought this keyboard blindly.But I found the keys pretty hard to press on the first day itself. I thought it maybe because it's new and would be easier with time. But to my horror, the keys went becoming hard and hard by the day.Now, after around 1 year of usage, the keys have become too hard to type anything smoothly. Every time I type I have to make sure all the letters are in place. Fingers also have started to pain.WORST EXPERIENCE.GENUINE REVIEW AFTER ALMOST 1 YEAR OF USAGE"
1,"I'm writing this review after using the keyboard for more than a year.Please do not buy this keyboard - I'm currently having a bad experience in gaming or even moderate typing. The keys stick to board and I have to tap hard to get them unstuck.I'm looking for alternatives now. My previous Keyboard was extremely good, lasted for almost 10 years and was of Logitech brand. Don't go for DELL keyboards. Not worth the money."
5,A very good product. Durable. After using for past 1 year it's still working like the same way it is working at the time it was new . Didn't face any type of problem till now. Very nice product. The key is also good very comfortable during typing.
5,"One of the best keyboards I have ever used. Very good for heavy and extensive daily use. Being used to Macbook keyboard and other keyboards, the different position of CTRL Key, Command key in Mac, Option key and Alt keys....will take some time in getting used to it. Other than that, this is the best quality keyboard with no noise at all, cannot hear typing. Overall Keyboard is compact and small, the main Querty keyboard is the size of 15.6 inch Macbook keyboard, but again not a problem for me. I just hope that this should last longer, next time going to buy the same. A really Dell brand high class product."
5,"This is the best PC keyboard I have used so far. Quick type. Laptop feeling! This chiclet is just so lovely. I am sure this is one of the best keyboard for PC. However, there is one problem. I feel the gaps while typing and this mean keys are not where the keys is normally found. This means when tying R you may type T. Migrating from Laptop keys is the issue because in Laptop there is absolutely no gap. I feel one has imagine the keys a little left and it can be get used to. After two days I am 95% corrected the typing errors without looking at the keyboard. I want to take it to 99% in the next 5-6 days. Ihope my will help those who want to get into the technicalities and details. But yes, it does give ""that laptop feeling"" while pressing them. I think it will be last for more than 5 years even if it is used roughly. You can say ""manhandling"""
5,"The keyboard is very smooth comfortable to operate.Pros:1. Chiclet type keys like laptop.2. Good key layout.3. Very easy to clean with a brush.4. Less sound and feather touch.5. Easy to install, just plug n play.Cons:The keyboard is somewhat long than normal keyboard, some may find it difficult to put in a keyboard tray."
5,"Got this delivered, couple of days back, well withing time and neatly packed. Its a superb keyboard, have used it quite a lot, in the past 2/3 days and the typing experience has been sublime. The keys are well placed and the build quality is excellent, so should be able stand the test of time. My laptop's keyboard has been acting up a bit so couldn't have asked for a better substitute. Its efficient/comfortable and convenient.Thanks Dell/Amazon!!"
5,"I used it to replace an 8 years old Dell KB 212 that came with my Dell Inspiron 620s. Some of it's keys recently stopped working. Could have been dust or water damage. Now if i wanted, i could get a mechanical keyboard, may be Redgear with brown switches but i really don't think they're worth it as the price difference is just too much. Also, i wanted a compact keyboard similar to my Dell KB 212 and there was no keyboard that was even close to Dell KB 216. So i hurriedly ordered it and to my surprise, it actually feels better and is even smaller than Dell KB 212. Though the biggest change i see is that it's silent which is good and 3 Extra buttons for volume. Highly recommended."
4,"The first time I ordered the keyboard, I received a defective one wherein the down arrow key wasn't working. I promptly applied for an exchange and got my replacement from Amazon without any hassles.It's a great keyboard considering I use it only for programming or writing code. It's not ergonomic but even after using it for 8-10 hours a day, I don't face any issues. I haven't used it for gaming at all.Overall, for plain typing or programming tasks, this is great value for money."
5,"I touch type and that at times results in genetic typing...my earlier keyboard, though not mechanical would make a considerable sound.It was bothering everyone around at office.Also the keyboard was reaching end of life.Also the earlier keyboard was wireless....It would lag at times for no reason and after pressing say 10 or so characters in rapid succession it would kind of hang or seem to ""buffer"" and then all characters would appear at once. The batteries were also depleting frequently...my heavy usage could've been one reason....but...they would deplete in 3 to 4 months...So decided to go for a USB keyboard..I did a lot of research before going for this.. Very happy with the keyboard...It's astonishing quiet, the keys feel good under the fingers...build quality is amazing....Very happy user here."
4,"I am a programmer who types a lot of code each day. Most of the keyboards I have used has faded the key prints.  This is a chiclet keys, easy to type if you are used to laptop keyboards.. Spacing is odd, and even prone to typos.. They keys started getting polished because of the heavy typing. also some keys which i use the most (ctrl, space, a, s, shift, backspace, arrow keys) have started wearing down to bottom. Still the most durable chiclet keyboard I have used. With audio controls, this is the best entry level keyboard.. Still the keys have become noisy..."
2,"It's noisy!Seems flimsy, cheap and plasticky.Not like the keyboard on my Dell laptop in terms of touchThe labelling of the letters is stuck over the plastic keys and it's so evident - feels like it will get worn out very soon - or can get scratched if you have very 'curious nails'.The size and layout seems fine.The look seems elegant and sleek.Overall I am not happy with the quality of this product when it comes to touch (which is important as that's how you use a keyboard!).There are some useful functions like volume keys and so on, but not useful to me personally as I don't use my PC for media at all.I had to buy this as I wasn't getting a DELL wireless keyboard without a mouse - as I had purchased a DELL mouse few months ago - weird restriction from DELL! I was let with no choice other than buying a non-DELL product or an extra mouse or this.Maybe my expectations were high from being a historical HP customer who is used to reasonably quality products? I don't know. So far I'm not pleased with the purchase."
4,Update:Thank you for the replacement exchange. The replacement keyboard works fine. Does the job well unlike the previously shipped one. All keys working and smooth. So increased the ⭐ rating to 4 from 1 as per my previous review as below.Review 2 days agoAt least 5 keys were not working so I have requested a return and replacement. There was no refund option so Awaiting a working product. I will update the review once I receive a replacement keyboard
3,"Just received it. Cheap quality plastic is used. I have been using this same model keyboard from last 4 years(2017), the one i purchased in 2017 has really good quality plastic keys. But since the wire was damaged, i wanted to have same model keyboard, order and got this, now i am disappointed.Dell shouldn't compromise on quality, increase the price, that's fine. I love spacing, layout and size of keys, hope it had good plastic too."
4,Product quality is good. easy to use...
5,"This is a pretty descent for people who want to do occasional typing. Key travel is good and feedback is okay.But dont get this keyboard for gaming. Lacks anti ghost support meaning you cannot use 3-4 keys at a time which is important in many games.For programmers, look for a mechanical keyboard rather than this."
2,"I'm using this keyboard for the past 1 year. The keys started to stick on the bottom when pressing after 3 months itself. That makes the typing experience annoying all the time. Now also while typing this ""A"" letter stuck (Stay pressed) while pressing.On gaming the problem is really a headache most of the time I don't even know what happens on the game then I came to notice the ""Ctrl"" button is staying pressed. Very Annoying."
5,"This was bought in 23rd August,2019 and is still working without any issues till date (21st August,2021).I bought it for the slender chiclet keys which are soft enough to be used.The LED for Num lock, Caps lock and Scroll lock are present. But, we would need the Fn key to enable the scroll lock which isn't such a big deal;as I haven't ever used scroll lock in my over 16 years of using PC.The right click button on the left of the right Control key is the one which some keyboards don't have on them. The right click key present here is a life saver when the mouse doesn't work; as I can navigate with keyboard shortcuts alone with expertise."
5,"I am using four keyboards.1. Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L white LED Cherry MX Blue switches.2. TVS Gold Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches.3. Asus Cerberus gaming keyboard.4. This very keyboard for which I am writing a review.I must say, if you want to do programming, just grab this keyboard with your eyes shut. Superb keyboard. Even if it gets damaged at any point of time, you can certainly buy a new one coz its cheap. Don't get me wrong, This is a durable keyboard. Got comfort for hands, even better than the cooler master's keyboard. I back-light is not a concern, buy this.you can get 11 dell keyboards in price of 1 cooler master masterkeys L pro white led keyboard. I am so happy with this keyboard. The chicklet keys are breeze for typing. I have typed more than 3000 words with this keyboard without fatigue. Just buy it. It's worth every penny."
4,So far so good. Tactile buttons. Surdy looking. No squeaky sounds. Button placements seems good. Overall a nice keyboard. Watch out for lighting deals to save extra
2,"I'm writing this review within first two hours of  delivery.Its not that cool as I thought of a dell product.cons:1)The backspace key don't work as other normal key work .  you have to use two finger to press button with same force or press it hard as you press enter.2)The buttons are not at all smooth to press, you have to put some force.3)The wire quality is not good.4)Made in China"
1,I don't know whether the seller or Dell is doing bad here. The quality of the keyboard is very poor. The keys are supposed to soft press. But this remembers me of the old typewriter. Keys are very hard. Very poor keyboard. Programmers do not buy this at any cost. I'd be returning this if possible.Nope! no return for this item.
5,The ideal keyboard for PC.Easy USB connection.Keys are really smooth to press and well organised.You might find some extra function keys than the old keyboards.The only thing I feel missing is its palm rest which isn't available for separate purchase on Amazon.But haven't faced any significant problems without them though.Overall very good product!
1,The buttons are not bright white as seen in photo. The size of buttons is very small and  it is not silent type key press.. it does not look original product as I use the same dell keyboard in office. It Looks like a cheep Chinese product. But I got it for 560rs. I would not have paid more for this keyboard... after couple of months I will have to buy a better one...
1,"After two days of use, i face the following issue with the keyboard. Many times, when the letter ""e"" and ""o"" pressed even once is typed continuously for 10 to 15 times. I had to press backspace and write again. Very low quality. I could not return and option is only for exchange of exact same item which is even more bad."
3,"I am having problems with this keyboard since it is not standard size. Touch typing is difficult since the fingers land on the wrong key. The key size and key spacing is not standard. The product description did not mention this, although it uses the word ""compact"". I cannot return this also, which is disappointing."
1,"I wanted to replace my aging hp keyboard that came with my computer because keys were getting sticky. Just in a few months the keys of the new keyboard have started getting stuck in pressed position resulting in likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I have to go back often and delete extra text and unpress the stuck key. This is supposed to be a good basic dell keyboard, but looks like poor quality control"
4,"Okay, so I think this is a very good keyboard from dell. But I was looking for a keyboard which looks and works like a laptop. With the keyboard having low-key travel I thought it would work great but it was nowhere close to a laptop's keyboard. very much higher key travel and softer keys instead of chicklet style keys which didn't give that satisfaction of typing for long durations. I would have kept it but the full-size feature of the keyboard worked as a curse for me having typing on the laptop for a long while, I just can't accept a keyboard that big. So unfortunately I have to return it. but the keyboard is great if you are a beginner and you are looking for a keyboard on your PC. I don't think so that any company other makes great keyboard with low key travel so I will probably order something from abroad as after looking in the Indian market, I don't think so that anything can satisfy my needs as of now for the budget I would like to spend on my keyboard.Well that's all for today folks so if any day you're thinking so buy this keyboard having laptop-like feel in mind then please consider something else, other than that you can go ahead and get this one!"
2,"I am writing this after using it for 4 months now. My Dell Latitude is a small sized laptop with which I used to have Logitech keyboard, which was very good but that belonged to the office. Just a week before the official lockdown announcement I started to work from home and that Logitech stayed back in the office. I always wanted to have a chiclet keyboard and ordered this. The Keyboard itself very solidly built, fill points to that. The problem I am facing is that it will stop working after 3-4 hours of use. First you will notice a lag in response and after that it just stops working. I have three other laptops and it behaves the same.  That's the reason for 2 stars."
5,"Hi, I am working from home. I already have a mechanical keyboard. But, it makes hell lot of clicky sounds which gives me headache at times. I was looking for a keyboard which makes near to no sound on clicking. Finally, I zeroed on to this keyboard. And, trust me this keyboard has made me so happy. I liked its chiclet keys. Affordable and soft keys. It is not for gaming purposes but only for normal day-to-day work. Thanks Amazon you are the saviour in this Pandemic.. 💕💞"
5,"Pros:Compact keyboard, soft touch but there is enough pressure that prevents accidental & very delicate touches from registering a keystroke. Your wpm will really improve after switching to this keyboard from a fully mechanical keyboard.Cons:The space bar could have been a bit more wider and curvy in design. function keys' width could have been more, just like a mechanical keyboard."
5,"No doubt, Its a 5 star product but it comes with its own set of minor issues which may affect certain set of users only.Rest its a wonderful product from Logitech. You get full functional keybaord in small comfortable to carry package with every required key on board. Typing is a breeze on this keybaord with soft responsive keys.UNBOXING1. Keyboard2. USB unifying receiver3. 2 AAA batteries pre installed (pull off white pullout from batteries, to power up keyboard)4. Two extra battery covers to choose your flavor (in all pink, blue, white)PROS:1. Full qwerty keyboard with numpad2. Keys are soft & responsive with proper feedback3. Full row of function keys with alternate shortcuts4. Light weight & overall small profile for easy carry on5. Comes with unifying receiver (look below for details)6. Nice looks, though not premium7. Good quality wrt soul porpose of keyboard ie typing8. Battery test: Working properly since 15th oct. Rest for how long it lasts, time will tell. Logitech claims 2 yr life, but i will update my review whenever battery replacement is required. Just for an idea, my mouse lasts for upto a year with single duracell, so we can expect good life from keyboard also.9. Upper arrow key is slightly projected, for easy identification in cramped layout of arrow keys. But you need to get used to it.10. Plug n play. Easy setup. Just connect & use.11. Works good with smartphone & smart tv also. Infact no setup required in case of android device, be it tv or mobile. Just plug in receiver & both keyboard & mouse will work without any issues.12. Price bracket. If you get to grab it on lightening deal, then its cherry on cake.CONS:1. Slightly thick profile especially in front zone, that too without a wrist rest, so may feel uncomfortable in long typing sessions.2. No caps, num, indicator, so you need to rely on software based on screen caps indicator. (in my case, my laptops own keyboard has caps led, so it indicates caps status)3. Would have preferred full size arrow keys. They could have reduced size of shifft key instead to accomodate. To cover all keys in small package, they have highly customized the layout. It will take time to get adjusted to it.4. Slight flex  in lower middle zone near space key due to improper height of mid zone rest pads. Theres 1-2 mm gap below them when keyboard rests on flat surface. So it can be fixed.5. Some basic fn shortcuts missing as per laptop perspective.-Theres this software named Setpoint by logitech available from product download page which you can use to customise FN + Function keys shortcuts. But you wont find setting to add brightness +/-, wifi toggle, touchpad toggle, projector etc. Its havving general shortcuts like my comp, copy paste, play pause, control panel, page up down etc.UNIFYING RECEIVER:It allows upto 6 compatible devices to connect to computer with just one receiver. Look for unifying symbol on device (orange square patch with clear asterisk mark) (pic attached)For easy setup,1. Install unifying software from logitech2. Start it and click on advanced3. Click on pair & follow on screen instructions4. All connected devices will be listed(Alternatively you can also follow direct steps on screen & click on next)Tested on Logitech B175 mouse & working properly. Both keyboard & mouse seamlessly connect to unifying receiver. B175 comes with normal reciever, but mouse is compatible with unifying technology.GENUINITY:Some users have commented on receiving fake or first copy product. I have received genuine product, successfully registered on Logitec site without any issue.Advice: Be carefull while choosing seller, to avvoid issues like this, check their ratings, amazon fulfilled tag etc. So far i had an awesome experience with Appario Retail.FINAL VERDICT:Its a perfect low cost, compact & effective device. You wont regret getting it. Its pros outweigh its cons. Havent faced any serious issue so far. Its all good & perfect company for may Dell XPS L502x."
4,"Its a nice keyboard and works great.PROS:1 light weight and compact2 unifying supported3 long lasting with batteries(24 months)CONS:1 has a bit flex when typing in center of the keyboard2 the stickers on keys are very reflective and not visible properly some time.3 has no indication leds for caps, num and locks4 up and down arrows are smallOverall a nice keyboard and would suggest if u can compromise few features for compactness and wireless."
1,"Do not buy this product. its fake.I got a duplicate item ,failed to register on logitech site.Logo  on the product differ from the original logitech logo even though the product in the picture given here has original logo ."
4,"i brought this keyboard for 650rs during a deal. and i still consider this as one of the best wireless keyboards under 1000rs but still it has some cons. now lets look at its  pros and coneslets starts with the pros◒ it is one of the smallest full sized keyboard with a number pad, you can easily carry it around in your laptop bag◒ i heard the battery life is awesome and it uses 2 regular AAA batterys which are cheaply available in the market◒ it is from a trusted company and my previous experience with Logitech customer service is good◒ you will get a slot to keep the dongle  in the keyboard itself and you will also get 3 interchangeable battery covers with the keyboard◒ i didnt face any connection issues or lag while using the keyboardnow coming to the cons◓ the frame of the keyboard is week and you may get irritated with it flex while typing especially with the stands on◓ the navigation keys have an odd shape and its hard to use the up arrow properly◓ overall the quality of the materials feels cheap and i don't think it can survive a drop or rough use, so you will have to use it carefully◓  if you intend to play games with it, just don't. then i will suggest to buy something wired or invest more to get something more rugged◓ overall if you are looking for a wireless keyboard you can carry around in your bag you may go with this one. But as i said this is not intended for gaming or rough use if this review helped you please press that helpful buttonUpdate after 6 monthsEven after six months  of use the keyboard is working perfectly and i didnt have to change the batterys yet. That battery cover gets easly scratched though (images are included)"
1,"Initially the keyboard was good, now the keys are not functioning properly. I have to press really hard to make the keys work. It's not just one or two alphabets but most of the alphabets are having the same issue. This is not a durable product. I am forced to change my initial review."
1,"Those who r giving high rating have any idea of how a keyboard should be? Why we use a keyboard?If you are buying the keyboard for general browsing then this keyboard is ok but you if use the keyboard for writing blogs, journal or writing assignments then this keyboard is not for you.The keyboard is flexible like rubber. Not stable at all. Compactness and flexibility make sure that your typing is full of errors because you can't be sure which key you are pressing as the keyboard is flexed. I am surprised why can't they make a stable/hard base.If portability is the only requirement then you go for this else don't waste your money. Don't even buy this as a backup keyboard for an emergency, ₹100 local USB keyboard will work far better than this one."
1,worked fine only for a few days. post which either the shift key or the ctrl key would get stuck and cause issues with typing. Not at all expected from logitech
4,"Logitech K230 is a wireless keyboard that comes with some interesting features. It is a compact keyboard which is  smaller as compared to the other keyboards. It is an affordable wireless keyboard and here, we take a look at its pros and cons:PROS.#.Good Wireless Connectivity.#.Security-128-bit AES Encryption#.Long Battery Life#.Travel Companion.#.Plug And Play.#.Value for money#Compact Design.CONS.#Some Fn Shortcut Keys Are Missing.Moreover it comes with 3 years warranty, which is quiet goods. Overall its good product to buy for daily use."
4,"Keyboard is compact, takes very little desk space and looks sleek.The keys are soft and its Great for typing.Ignore the reviews posted that it's not good for gaming. I've played warzone, fortnite etc. And faced no issues.Although while gaming it has key ghosting if more that 6-7 keys are pressed at the same time. Not an issue for most games your left hand has only 5 fingers.Latency: No issues, Modern wireless keyboards have come far as to face not such delayed response times. I can say the same for this keyboard as well.It'll take a few days to get used to."
1,I absolutely HATE it!I didn't return it right away as I waited to acclimatize to its HORRIBLE key placement - truth is even today after nearly 8 months of use I still have to look at the keyboard to hit the Delete & Backspace key.The reduced size is good to look at and also makes for a cute product shot but the buck stops there.
4,"It's not a deal maker or a deal breaker. It simply gets the work done, hands down. Numeric keypad is useful in such a compact size. Light weight makes it portable. You get two different coloured battery covers (on the left) as spare or to customize your needs.Logitech Unifying receiver is an added advantage as I am already using a Logitech wireless mouse. Just download the Logitech Unifying utility software and pair both devices to either of the receiver. Arrow keys are a bit small but I think you'll get accustomed to it. No Caps, Num, Scroll lights, but yeah there's FN key atleast. I think, you can't ask for much from Logitech at this price."
1,I am not sure how this is rated so high yet a poor choice compared to other keyboards.1. The size of the keyboard is smaller than typically expected. You have to squeeze your hands to type and it is inconvenient.2. The keys on the lower row can easily come off in few months as it is not covered.It falls short on ergonomics and nowhere good for anyone who wants to type for a long time / with ease.3. The key tap is neither soft nor quiet.4. The product description image looks nice but it is a cheap plastic.4 You can replace but you cannot return this itemI wanted to replace my Dell keyboard for a better one but after buying this I started to like Dell keyboard better.
5,"PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - Logitech's very sleek, compact yet spacious, smartly designed keyboard. Its black in colour with Logitech written in grey strip (also complimentary blue and pink Logitech strip offered) branding on left side of the keyboard under which you have batteries. Battery placement was quite impressive. No need to toss your keyboard for battery replacememt. So it's been 2 months plus and I have no complains whatsoever. Working smooth. The spacing between alphabets/numericals is good for easy typing. ""Ergonomically designed"" with raised buttons. The range keyboard covers is jaw-dropping (pretty huge distance between desktop on study table and keyboard on bed and still works wonderful during movie times). Keyboard can be kept at an angle for more height/ comfortable typing with the help of brackets given backside of the keyboard. Requires gentle pressing of keys. User-friendly, hassle-free, does not require any Installation of software to be done. Compatible with almost all laptops/desktops I believe. No flaws found.BRAND - One can blindly trust Logitech. True to its claims and functions and does the job.SELLER - Sold by ""Appario Retail Pvt Ltd"". Nicely bubble wrapped and delivered.PRICE - It's high but against quality given its totally worth every penny. Its a long time investment.DELIVERY - Was on time and as expected.PS - Keyboard is provided with set of batteries."
5,I liked below:Compact SizeNumber pad like normal keyboardSmooth and big buttonsUnifying receiver to connect 6 unifying wireless devices. (same unifying receiver of my keyboard paired with my old wireless logitech mouse without any hassle. Both the new kew board and the old wireless mouse working like a combo unit using single unifying receiver supplied with the unit)I did not like:There is no On/Off marking at the power switch at the back panel. I had to use external marker to note on/off of the unit.
3,"The keyboard got problems within a month of purchase - a few keys started working on their own, without pressing them, making the keyboard useless. Fortunately the Logitech Service Center in my city replaced it with a new one on the same day.Pros:1. Small & compact.2. Comes with a Unifying Receiver and Unifying support. So can be used with other Logitech Unifying supported devices with only a single receiver plugged in. I use my mouse (Logitech M235) such.3. Has a Numeric keypad.4. Logitech service is good as they provide replacement asap. And there's a 3 year warranty.Cons:1. No Caps lock on/off indicator. Same with Num lock.2. Flex in middle part of keyboard.3. Placement of certain keys is not good."
5,"Product came with clean packing. The adapter and keyboard wqs well packed. Comes with 2 AAA batter fitted itself in keyboard one had to pull the paper tags to make it working.Now coming to the product. Product is working fine. Those who complaining about the product should visit logitech website and download the required software. You should also update the adapter firmware as it will smooth your experiences. And also download the software for keyboard which will help you to customise the shortcuts. Overall a great product. Buy without any doubt because according to price it good.Just one complain keys like shift , enter , arrow and , ptrscr , scroll etc is very very small . But if one need just the keyboatd for the sake of doing few stuffs its a good go.I am not a gamer so won't be able to say how it behaves in games. I don't switch off this device as it has auto sleep feature which i guess works great . Using since 15 days working great till now. Registered on logitech website product shown as genuine and got registered."
3,Does its job.For day to day typing and use its decent. Pros:Key travelKey feelPortableNo noticable input lagSturdy.Full numpad layout.Cons:Minimal key separation causing multiple keys to clickUnnatural key positioning diagonally across keys requiring adjustingSmall ctrl keyNot comfortable for gaming ( you shouldn't be buying this for that anyway)No special key LEDs ( caps/num)
3,"Cursor key is one of the most used key for gaming/ documents and it is the most badly placed key in this keyboard .. it almost impossible to hit upper arrow with pressing any additional button with it. its kind of frustrating. and as amazon do not have return facility, Its useless product for me. I even trust to sell it as low as 500 but the next person returned it just after use of 30 minutes due to the same problem.  That much annoying design it has. Dont look as the cheapest price tag for logitech keyboard. It is one of the worst of logitech. I have 7 keyboard mouse of logitech and they all works fantabulous but this one Sucks."
4,"This keyboard was perfect suit for my needs. I needed one that fits on my table and isn't stretched across the table. This kind of gives a feel of the 14"" laptop keypad. Its easy to type and occupies less space. Some of the pro's and con's after a month of use -Pro's:1. connects in a flash. the USB nano head comes with a small asterisk painted on top to indicate which side should be plugged into the PC. Does not fumble while plugging it in. Once plugged the connectivity is instant. Did not observe any lag in typing and keystrokes reflected on screen.2. Extremely compact. Got all the keys crammed in. Easy to type3. Convenient - easy to carry around and also occupies less space on the table topCon's:1. Certain utilitarian keys are missing. e.g. The right click key, backlight to indicate whether caps or num-lock is on2. the arrow keys usage needs some practice and skill3. Due to its compact nature some times your fingers might press the adjacent keys instead of the ones you want to hit. Takes a bit of practicing."
5,"Very soft keys. And stylish look. Three color battery cover, on/off switch. N software for battery indicar and media keys function. Full size keyboard with number pad. And unifying technology was a master point. Because I have brought m235 mouse separately and joined with single dongle.  And I have registered both products in Logitech website so I get three years warranty. Thanks Amazon n seller."
3,"The keyboard feels cheap in quality, little bent at the middle and squeaking when pressed the plastic areas at the sides, though the packaging is great with 2 extra battery covers. The size of the keyboard is nice but the right Ctrl key placement and volume keys in relation to Fn key is aweful. There is lag in video games as expected due to its wirelessness, especially in racing games the lag is very noticeable. Overall okay keyboard at this price."
4,"Product plastic is very average quality, not flimsy, but not strong. Key spacing is little congested, however after few days of use you can easily adjusted to it.  Up arrow key is little and placed little higher so we can easily recognize without seeing.Performance wise this keyboard is performing very nicely, range is good and no lag observed. Instantly connects when you plug the unifying receiver to it.I observed one issue in the product serial numbering which is also confirmed by Logitech. Box serial no is different and product serial no is different. As per Logitech, keyboard S/N no is important and that need to be registered at their website.Lets hope it last as it is expected. Will review again if any issue I encounter with this product."
2,"The size is very small. One can't type and do regular work on it.I never thought the keys will be this much small, that wont be able to type.Seeing the picture made the purchase and now its kept idle as can't be returned as well.Later on got different keyboard for using by visiting shop physically.Wont recommend the keyboard. Wastage of money only."
1,very difficult to type usin this that keys are difficulty to press as we are accompstomed to regular keyboard thse keyboard are too small and keys are place at irregular distane .even pressing shift keys are difficulty and those keys .dissapointed and htat space bar keep on pressing when i sleep and use this keyboard .dissaponited .why they made is so small .zebronics companion was better did a mistake ordering this any way had it been bigger would have given 5 star .need to order another good qualitythis i shall use while on the go traveling time any way if i practice in this keyboard i may l oose that typing skills in that regular keyboard .
5,"This is our second Logitech keyboard, the first was the MK250 set. I gave that set to my cousins. This board comparitively is much smaller and easier to carry in a slim profile laptop bag. Love the Logitech Universal set point application. The keys do have a bounce but there is no ""clicky"" sound. It is a slimmer board so the plastics are not thick, there is a bending that will occur if you purposely try to bend it. All the hotkeys/function keys are present as well as the number pad. There are NO LIGHTS on this board, BUT if and when you engage Caps lock or Num lock it will show on screen and if your laptop has these lights it will be lit up as well. This is an exact setup and length as my 15"" Toshiba Satelite C55 board. Overall it's a nice unit to have if 1) your desk space is minimal and 2) if you take your laptop and keyboard in a laptop bookbag or satchel."
4,I have been using this from beginning of Feb 2021. It is good but here few issues I would like to bring up:1. The letters and symbols on the key are protected by some coating they are such a strain to eyes and many a times I have to move your head to get the clear letter. For those used to typing without looking at key board it is fine but nor for others like me.2. I have already changed the battery once on 8th March 21. So it has come only for a month. The Logitech key board I was using for last 20 years (Bought in Dec 2001) had a very good battery life almost one year.But for the above it is very good.
1,"It's a pathetic keyboard. Coming from Logitech such substandard quality is a surprise to me! I ordered one and post receipt I realised that no matter how close or far you are from the PC, the keypad is unable to transmit properly thereby resulting in half of the things not being typed properly. Post pressing a particular key, its takes about 2-3 seconds for it to appear on the screen. And sometimes it doesn't even appear and to top it, the same letter appears continuously on the screen despite releasing the key.I returned the item and ordered a new unit. The new unit behaved well for a week or so and thereafter it too started giving the same problem. I think there is some fundamental problem with the design of the keyboard. I tried the keyboard on both my laptop as well as my PC but the problem persisted. Now with the return window closed, I am stuck with this defective item which works as per its own whims and fancies, typing and churning out letters on its own once a particular key is pressed.Overall a bad piece of equipment coming from a renowned brand such as Logitech.Bottom line: Don't buy it. It's a complete waste of money and is useless since it cannot be used even for basic typing without getting frustrated."
5,"Pros:This is the only reasonably priced keyboard I could find with Logitech unifying receiver, which could be useful for future mouse pairing with same receiver.The keys are reasonably quiet while being tactileVery compact form even with separate number pad.VFM at INR800Cons:There is no off switch. Need to check how long the battery lasts.The battery covers options doesn't include black (minor gripe)The piece I received had a very hard 's' key and I was about to return (replace) it. But with little bit of usage, it appears fine now. However this points to poor quality check by Logitech.Some may need time to get used to the placement of arrow keys, Home, End, Page up/down, but this is a necessary trade off for the compact size."
4,"Product Description: ***** Received as describedPacking: ***** very goodMaterial: ***** plasticValue for money: ****Box contains:✔️ 1 Keyboard✔️ 2x AAA batteries✔️ 1 receiver✔️ Dimensions: LxB = 14cm x 4.5 cm approxPros: • Compact design •  Plug and play •  Long battery life of 24 months(as claimed) • Encryption enabled(hope it will save fron keylogger)Cons: • No Caps indicator • No Num lock indicator • Small Up/down keysThis is my 2nd K230 keyboard, old one lasted for 3 years before dying.I ordered the same as there was a deal going on amazon for 699₹.My need was a wireless, ergonomically designed. Keys are soft to press, I opened the old one and found there is a plastic membrane. It lasted for 3 years so could say it's bit sturdy. If you need a compact keyboard and want to carry a keyboard in travel bag, then go for it without second thought.I would definitely recommend this purchase."
4,"Bought this keyboard as I wanted a keyboard which is unifying receiver ready.  Not only is the keyboard unifying receiver ready, it actually comes with a unifying receiver making it a bargain for Rs. 699/-I did not use the receiver that came with the keyboard; instead paired it with an existing receiver to which all my other keyboards and mice are paired.Keyboard has been working as expected and quality is good as you would expect from a Logitech product.The keyboard is great for cramped spaces and is also a good choice if you have to move around the keyboard or would travel with it.The issue with the compact dimension is that keys are space closer to each other and spacing is different from other keyboards including other Logitech keyboards.  The function keys, cursor keys and Home/End/Pg Up / Pg Down keys are also smaller and these together can introduce typos when you are touch typing, i.e., typing without looking at the keyboard.  I am hoping that the error rate will come down as I get used to the keyboard.  Will update the review based on usage."
4,"Its a good wireless keyboard just plug and play so easy to use and its usefull for just daily tasks like typing and etc, its a bit small in size than other keyboards but for gaming its not ideal at all, if you want this gaming dont go for this i reckon coz the keys are on stiffer side and the key travel is deep so 'No' for gaming. Finally its good bank for buck for normal usage but definitely not for gaming. Thanks :)"
4,"Keyboard is compact. Key placement is also good. I bought this for daily office use. And my most of the work involves in writing code. So being compact, my fingers can reach the keys without much of wrist movement and gives me a confident feedback while typing. Connects like a gem and never had any issues so far. Been using it for last 2 months. The only downside I see is the function keys are slightly hard to hit. But nevertheless recommended keyboard! specially for programmers."
1,"Keyboard looks good, has swappable color cover for battery port (Silver, Blue and Pink).However, the biggest issue is that the keys are spaced too close to each other, arrow keys are horribly placed, numkey spacing is fine but keys like enter, backspace are too small. Result? Large number of mistakes when typing anything. Even the Function keys are immediately above number keys and you are bound to make wrong function calls due to this. Not even talking about lack of basics functions like lights to indicate caplock is on.Basically, its a keyboard that fails as a keyboard."
5,"No doubt, Its a 5 star product but it comes with its own set of minor issues which may affect certain set of users only.Rest its a wonderful product from Logitech. You get full functional keybaord in small comfortable to carry package with every required key on board. Typing is a breeze on this keybaord with soft responsive keys.UNBOXING1. Keyboard2. USB unifying receiver3. 2 AAA batteries pre installed (pull off white pullout from batteries, to power up keyboard)4. Two extra battery covers to choose your flavor (in all pink, blue, white)PROS:1. Full qwerty keyboard with numpad2. Keys are soft & responsive with proper feedback3. Full row of function keys with alternate shortcuts4. Light weight & overall small profile for easy carry on5. Comes with unifying receiver (look below for details)6. Nice looks, though not premium7. Good quality wrt soul porpose of keyboard ie typing8. Battery test: Working properly since 15th oct. Rest for how long it lasts, time will tell. Logitech claims 2 yr life, but i will update my review whenever battery replacement is required. Just for an idea, my mouse lasts for upto a year with single duracell, so we can expect good life from keyboard also.9. Upper arrow key is slightly projected, for easy identification in cramped layout of arrow keys. But you need to get used to it.10. Plug n play. Easy setup. Just connect & use.11. Works good with smartphone & smart tv also. Infact no setup required in case of android device, be it tv or mobile. Just plug in receiver & both keyboard & mouse will work without any issues.12. Price bracket. If you get to grab it on lightening deal, then its cherry on cake.CONS:1. Slightly thick profile especially in front zone, that too without a wrist rest, so may feel uncomfortable in long typing sessions.2. No caps, num, indicator, so you need to rely on software based on screen caps indicator. (in my case, my laptops own keyboard has caps led, so it indicates caps status)3. Would have preferred full size arrow keys. They could have reduced size of shifft key instead to accomodate. To cover all keys in small package, they have highly customized the layout. It will take time to get adjusted to it.4. Slight flex  in lower middle zone near space key due to improper height of mid zone rest pads. Theres 1-2 mm gap below them when keyboard rests on flat surface. So it can be fixed.5. Some basic fn shortcuts missing as per laptop perspective.-Theres this software named Setpoint by logitech available from product download page which you can use to customise FN + Function keys shortcuts. But you wont find setting to add brightness +/-, wifi toggle, touchpad toggle, projector etc. Its havving general shortcuts like my comp, copy paste, play pause, control panel, page up down etc.UNIFYING RECEIVER:It allows upto 6 compatible devices to connect to computer with just one receiver. Look for unifying symbol on device (orange square patch with clear asterisk mark) (pic attached)For easy setup,1. Install unifying software from logitech2. Start it and click on advanced3. Click on pair & follow on screen instructions4. All connected devices will be listed(Alternatively you can also follow direct steps on screen & click on next)Tested on Logitech B175 mouse & working properly. Both keyboard & mouse seamlessly connect to unifying receiver. B175 comes with normal reciever, but mouse is compatible with unifying technology.GENUINITY:Some users have commented on receiving fake or first copy product. I have received genuine product, successfully registered on Logitec site without any issue.Advice: Be carefull while choosing seller, to avvoid issues like this, check their ratings, amazon fulfilled tag etc. So far i had an awesome experience with Appario Retail.FINAL VERDICT:Its a perfect low cost, compact & effective device. You wont regret getting it. Its pros outweigh its cons. Havent faced any serious issue so far. Its all good & perfect company for may Dell XPS L502x."
4,"Its a nice keyboard and works great.PROS:1 light weight and compact2 unifying supported3 long lasting with batteries(24 months)CONS:1 has a bit flex when typing in center of the keyboard2 the stickers on keys are very reflective and not visible properly some time.3 has no indication leds for caps, num and locks4 up and down arrows are smallOverall a nice keyboard and would suggest if u can compromise few features for compactness and wireless."
1,"Do not buy this product. its fake.I got a duplicate item ,failed to register on logitech site.Logo  on the product differ from the original logitech logo even though the product in the picture given here has original logo ."
4,"i brought this keyboard for 650rs during a deal. and i still consider this as one of the best wireless keyboards under 1000rs but still it has some cons. now lets look at its  pros and coneslets starts with the pros◒ it is one of the smallest full sized keyboard with a number pad, you can easily carry it around in your laptop bag◒ i heard the battery life is awesome and it uses 2 regular AAA batterys which are cheaply available in the market◒ it is from a trusted company and my previous experience with Logitech customer service is good◒ you will get a slot to keep the dongle  in the keyboard itself and you will also get 3 interchangeable battery covers with the keyboard◒ i didnt face any connection issues or lag while using the keyboardnow coming to the cons◓ the frame of the keyboard is week and you may get irritated with it flex while typing especially with the stands on◓ the navigation keys have an odd shape and its hard to use the up arrow properly◓ overall the quality of the materials feels cheap and i don't think it can survive a drop or rough use, so you will have to use it carefully◓  if you intend to play games with it, just don't. then i will suggest to buy something wired or invest more to get something more rugged◓ overall if you are looking for a wireless keyboard you can carry around in your bag you may go with this one. But as i said this is not intended for gaming or rough use if this review helped you please press that helpful buttonUpdate after 6 monthsEven after six months  of use the keyboard is working perfectly and i didnt have to change the batterys yet. That battery cover gets easly scratched though (images are included)"
1,"Initially the keyboard was good, now the keys are not functioning properly. I have to press really hard to make the keys work. It's not just one or two alphabets but most of the alphabets are having the same issue. This is not a durable product. I am forced to change my initial review."
1,"Those who r giving high rating have any idea of how a keyboard should be? Why we use a keyboard?If you are buying the keyboard for general browsing then this keyboard is ok but you if use the keyboard for writing blogs, journal or writing assignments then this keyboard is not for you.The keyboard is flexible like rubber. Not stable at all. Compactness and flexibility make sure that your typing is full of errors because you can't be sure which key you are pressing as the keyboard is flexed. I am surprised why can't they make a stable/hard base.If portability is the only requirement then you go for this else don't waste your money. Don't even buy this as a backup keyboard for an emergency, ₹100 local USB keyboard will work far better than this one."
1,worked fine only for a few days. post which either the shift key or the ctrl key would get stuck and cause issues with typing. Not at all expected from logitech
4,"Logitech K230 is a wireless keyboard that comes with some interesting features. It is a compact keyboard which is  smaller as compared to the other keyboards. It is an affordable wireless keyboard and here, we take a look at its pros and cons:PROS.#.Good Wireless Connectivity.#.Security-128-bit AES Encryption#.Long Battery Life#.Travel Companion.#.Plug And Play.#.Value for money#Compact Design.CONS.#Some Fn Shortcut Keys Are Missing.Moreover it comes with 3 years warranty, which is quiet goods. Overall its good product to buy for daily use."
4,"Keyboard is compact, takes very little desk space and looks sleek.The keys are soft and its Great for typing.Ignore the reviews posted that it's not good for gaming. I've played warzone, fortnite etc. And faced no issues.Although while gaming it has key ghosting if more that 6-7 keys are pressed at the same time. Not an issue for most games your left hand has only 5 fingers.Latency: No issues, Modern wireless keyboards have come far as to face not such delayed response times. I can say the same for this keyboard as well.It'll take a few days to get used to."
1,I absolutely HATE it!I didn't return it right away as I waited to acclimatize to its HORRIBLE key placement - truth is even today after nearly 8 months of use I still have to look at the keyboard to hit the Delete & Backspace key.The reduced size is good to look at and also makes for a cute product shot but the buck stops there.
4,"It's not a deal maker or a deal breaker. It simply gets the work done, hands down. Numeric keypad is useful in such a compact size. Light weight makes it portable. You get two different coloured battery covers (on the left) as spare or to customize your needs.Logitech Unifying receiver is an added advantage as I am already using a Logitech wireless mouse. Just download the Logitech Unifying utility software and pair both devices to either of the receiver. Arrow keys are a bit small but I think you'll get accustomed to it. No Caps, Num, Scroll lights, but yeah there's FN key atleast. I think, you can't ask for much from Logitech at this price."
1,I am not sure how this is rated so high yet a poor choice compared to other keyboards.1. The size of the keyboard is smaller than typically expected. You have to squeeze your hands to type and it is inconvenient.2. The keys on the lower row can easily come off in few months as it is not covered.It falls short on ergonomics and nowhere good for anyone who wants to type for a long time / with ease.3. The key tap is neither soft nor quiet.4. The product description image looks nice but it is a cheap plastic.4 You can replace but you cannot return this itemI wanted to replace my Dell keyboard for a better one but after buying this I started to like Dell keyboard better.
5,"PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - Logitech's very sleek, compact yet spacious, smartly designed keyboard. Its black in colour with Logitech written in grey strip (also complimentary blue and pink Logitech strip offered) branding on left side of the keyboard under which you have batteries. Battery placement was quite impressive. No need to toss your keyboard for battery replacememt. So it's been 2 months plus and I have no complains whatsoever. Working smooth. The spacing between alphabets/numericals is good for easy typing. ""Ergonomically designed"" with raised buttons. The range keyboard covers is jaw-dropping (pretty huge distance between desktop on study table and keyboard on bed and still works wonderful during movie times). Keyboard can be kept at an angle for more height/ comfortable typing with the help of brackets given backside of the keyboard. Requires gentle pressing of keys. User-friendly, hassle-free, does not require any Installation of software to be done. Compatible with almost all laptops/desktops I believe. No flaws found.BRAND - One can blindly trust Logitech. True to its claims and functions and does the job.SELLER - Sold by ""Appario Retail Pvt Ltd"". Nicely bubble wrapped and delivered.PRICE - It's high but against quality given its totally worth every penny. Its a long time investment.DELIVERY - Was on time and as expected.PS - Keyboard is provided with set of batteries."
5,I liked below:Compact SizeNumber pad like normal keyboardSmooth and big buttonsUnifying receiver to connect 6 unifying wireless devices. (same unifying receiver of my keyboard paired with my old wireless logitech mouse without any hassle. Both the new kew board and the old wireless mouse working like a combo unit using single unifying receiver supplied with the unit)I did not like:There is no On/Off marking at the power switch at the back panel. I had to use external marker to note on/off of the unit.
3,"The keyboard got problems within a month of purchase - a few keys started working on their own, without pressing them, making the keyboard useless. Fortunately the Logitech Service Center in my city replaced it with a new one on the same day.Pros:1. Small & compact.2. Comes with a Unifying Receiver and Unifying support. So can be used with other Logitech Unifying supported devices with only a single receiver plugged in. I use my mouse (Logitech M235) such.3. Has a Numeric keypad.4. Logitech service is good as they provide replacement asap. And there's a 3 year warranty.Cons:1. No Caps lock on/off indicator. Same with Num lock.2. Flex in middle part of keyboard.3. Placement of certain keys is not good."

4,"Product Description: ***** Received as describedPacking: ***** very goodMaterial: ***** plasticValue for money: ****Box contains:✔️ 1 Keyboard✔️ 2x AAA batteries✔️ 1 receiver✔️ Dimensions: LxB = 14cm x 4.5 cm approxPros: • Compact design •  Plug and play •  Long battery life of 24 months(as claimed) • Encryption enabled(hope it will save fron keylogger)Cons: • No Caps indicator • No Num lock indicator • Small Up/down keysThis is my 2nd K230 keyboard, old one lasted for 3 years before dying.I ordered the same as there was a deal going on amazon for 699₹.My need was a wireless, ergonomically designed. Keys are soft to press, I opened the old one and found there is a plastic membrane. It lasted for 3 years so could say it's bit sturdy. If you need a compact keyboard and want to carry a keyboard in travel bag, then go for it without second thought.I would definitely recommend this purchase."
4,"Bought this keyboard as I wanted a keyboard which is unifying receiver ready.  Not only is the keyboard unifying receiver ready, it actually comes with a unifying receiver making it a bargain for Rs. 699/-I did not use the receiver that came with the keyboard; instead paired it with an existing receiver to which all my other keyboards and mice are paired.Keyboard has been working as expected and quality is good as you would expect from a Logitech product.The keyboard is great for cramped spaces and is also a good choice if you have to move around the keyboard or would travel with it.The issue with the compact dimension is that keys are space closer to each other and spacing is different from other keyboards including other Logitech keyboards.  The function keys, cursor keys and Home/End/Pg Up / Pg Down keys are also smaller and these together can introduce typos when you are touch typing, i.e., typing without looking at the keyboard.  I am hoping that the error rate will come down as I get used to the keyboard.  Will update the review based on usage."
4,"Its a good wireless keyboard just plug and play so easy to use and its usefull for just daily tasks like typing and etc, its a bit small in size than other keyboards but for gaming its not ideal at all, if you want this gaming dont go for this i reckon coz the keys are on stiffer side and the key travel is deep so 'No' for gaming. Finally its good bank for buck for normal usage but definitely not for gaming. Thanks :)"
4,"Keyboard is compact. Key placement is also good. I bought this for daily office use. And my most of the work involves in writing code. So being compact, my fingers can reach the keys without much of wrist movement and gives me a confident feedback while typing. Connects like a gem and never had any issues so far. Been using it for last 2 months. The only downside I see is the function keys are slightly hard to hit. But nevertheless recommended keyboard! specially for programmers."
1,"Keyboard looks good, has swappable color cover for battery port (Silver, Blue and Pink).However, the biggest issue is that the keys are spaced too close to each other, arrow keys are horribly placed, numkey spacing is fine but keys like enter, backspace are too small. Result? Large number of mistakes when typing anything. Even the Function keys are immediately above number keys and you are bound to make wrong function calls due to this. Not even talking about lack of basics functions like lights to indicate caplock is on.Basically, its a keyboard that fails as a keyboard."
1,"Updated Review: Horrible purchase.You can't clean the keyboard easilyThe keys flick out while typingBattery life is super awful for both mouse and keyboardBought 3 sets, all 3 same issue. It isn't cheap because the experience and aftercosts are awfully excessive. Regret it with utmost frustration.Old review below isn't valid anymore but leaving it so you can see what really happened and how awful this set is.Old Review》Over the decades I have purchased many Wireless Keyboard-Mice set including big brand names like Logitech, Microsoft and Dell. While they are good quality but are often too expensive for most buyers or the lower range sets do not have the quality required. This keyboard and mice set by Zebronics is finally the answer to both the problems.Pros:1. Sturdy make and elevated keys are really super convenient to use.2. Very easy to clean and maintain without much hassle3. Battery lasts really long and best point - single battery each for both keyboard and mouse.4. Mouse is just the right size, neither too bulky, nor too small.5. Low Battery indication is super handy in the keyboard.Cons:1. Mouse does not have low battery indication but then again with only one battery requirement, its not a big one2. No Indicators for Num, Scroll, and Caps-Lock keys being active.If you look at the entire package, and pricing, it is great value for money. I was skeptical at first but after buying one set and seeing its performance over 6 months, I purchased yet another set and intend to replace all sets one by one with the Zebronics Companion 102 model specifically.My recommendation - GO FOR IT!"
5,"Have been looking a good range wireless keyboard for a very long time and now i can lit up my head that i have got a perfect wireless keyboard and mouse. I strongly recommed it to the office users as most of my presentation i bring up laptop and all the time i have to walk near the laptop to change the slides, now why worrie? when i got this wireless keyboard to change the slide from the place where is stand. I also use it for my personal home use where i can sit in the couch and watch my fav movie from lap and no need go near to the lap to change the movie just sit on my couch and use my fav keyboard...Zebronicz is always the best in the market and this item is far good.. I blindly recommend it.. I give my personal guarenntteee.."
5,"Guys this product is too good 👌 in its range ... I bought it in 9€ price might be fluctuate as per demand ... Lets come on its review keyboard buttons are amazing , sensitive enough , design is well and good  , connectivity is at its best . Mouse design is ok , connectivity is super awesome ... I would recommend u guys to go for it 😁 I am totally satisfied with it .... Go for it 👍"
3,"I ordered this combo pack and was promptly delivered the next day. Thanks Amazon for the experience.The keyboard required 1*AAA battery and the mouse needs 1*AA battery which fortunately comes along with the package. The keyboard has floating key design which has good tactile feel to it and so far has been crisp. However the same cannot be said for the mouse as it feels small in the palm and has very inaccurate pointing.Overall, when compared the price with other big brands this package it an essential VFM product.Edit: Reducing a star because of the poor performance of the mouse, it lacks precision and battery life awful"
5,This combo of keyboard and mouse is very useful for daily activities on laptop l. The precision is good and the in built design is good.The only issue is sometimes the keyboard is malfunctioning sometimes and goes on typing the same letter for so many times.
1,"Cheee worst, this keyboard already stopped working and thanks to amazon for selling worst products at cheap price without maintaining any standard. No customer service from zeb as well wasted all my money"

5,Mouse battery consumption is too high
5,"very user friendly , light weight, responsive keysthanks"
5,"Everything is fine, except the absence of light indicator for. Caplock key. Battery for Mouse drain fast."
4,"This wireless keyboard is very good as expected. But with regards to the mouse, the build quality and the look should have been better. And both keyboard and mouse works really good. Good part is that have got batteries(Normal one, not a rechargeable) along with the packing that I received so no need of buying it again."

5,Very good product
5,"Recently I have purchased this product. One of the awesome part of this product is a single adapter can be used for connecting both the keyboard and mouse. I have using the keyboard and mouse for both coding and gaming purpose, it works good for me. And best of all is that it's price of 750rupees."
5,Always zeb good brand. It proves with this.
5,This product has nano technology which is good and both keyboard and mouse need only one sensor
5,I am using this product from last 5 month.It's working good.Battery life also ok for my light use.Little issue in Keywords key it's remove easily.

1,"I have used this product for 3 months and now I am suggesting you people not to buy this keyboard and mouse. Battery life is very less and build quality is also low. Please dont go with its cheap price. My mouse is not working properly. Sometimes it work. Sometimes doesnt. The light in its mouse is not optical means not invisible. For wireless mouse optical invisible light is must for more battery life. My keyboard is completly filled of dust which I cant clean. Finally I need to tell, please dont buy this."
5,As of now its working good but battery included with this worst. My battery stopped working in mouse.
5,Value for money
5,keyboard keys are going to smoothly
5,Good product
5,Good product
4,"Though not a gamer, I type a lot. I had a mechanical keyboard and because it was showing double-key entry problem so frequently in multiple keys, and cleaning didn't help, I decided to go for a new keyboard. However, a decent TKL mechanical keyboard in my budget wasn't available for purchase and hence decided to go with this mechanical-like membrane keyboard for the time being.The raised switches give it a look of a mechanical keyboard. However, the typing experience is not comparable to a mechanical keyboard. It does feel better than the usual membrane keyboard though. It does make some noise while typing, and it is not that pleasant like typing in a mechanical keyboard. So, if you want a silent keyboard, this is not the one for you. It does come with basic backlighting. RGB colors are available but without many options. Three brightness levels are there, and a dedicated key to toggle light state. Windows key lock function is also there. Though the product description says, 'Dedicated Software Application' is available, I couldn't find one in the Amkette website.Coming to the typing experience, the keys are comfortable and spacing is adequate. I could achieve an average typing speed of 54 WPM with 100% accuracy. It is reasonably good. The build quality is also good for a keyboard at this price, and it seems a well-built product to last. The braided cable (which is not detachable from the keyboard) is good, and the length is adequate.The rubber padding in the bottom is not good enough (and is not available for the top legs), and hence the keyboard tend to move around at times, especially with the top legs extended.The right arrow key in my keyboard wasn't working properly. It needed extra force, like press it down really hard, to get the key register. Anyways, I pulled the keycap and added a small piece of double side tape and it solved the problem. Though I contacted the seller, they replied to contact via WhatsApp and all. Since I could make it work, I didn't bother. It is too much hassle to return and get a new keyboard, and I needed the keyboard badly. Hopefully, it will last."
4,"Prior to buying, I have been using the Logitech G102 Prodigy Wired Mouse for my desktop uses, which costs about the same as this mouse. Therefore I can make some direct comparison between the two mice.Looks wise :- The mouse looks pretty great. I would argue, probably even better than my Logitech mouse. Although the mouse have only 4 LED options, for a budget mouse, I think it is fair. It doesn't get as bright as my Logitech mouse, which for me, I consider as a good thing, because while I am using the mouse in a dark room, I need just enough light to discern where the mouse is and not distract me (something that frequently happens with my Logitech mouse). It is a bit bigger than my Logitech G102 mouse. I don't mind it since they are still within the comfort range of my hands, but I can see how someone may not feel the same way about the size. The wire is braided and the braiding used is of fairly good quality. The USB plug is well built and very sturdy.Software and warranty :- As of writing this review, Amkette has not yet put up the software drivers for this mouse for programming the macros buttons, even though on their product box, it was mentioned that you can find them on their website links. One cannot not even register the mouse for warranty since they have not included the mouse as part of their product line up. I would urge Amkette to rectify this problem quickly. Such actions should have been completed long before shipping the product to the customer.Functionality :- Regarding the ""7 Programmable macro buttons"" as advertised, as mentioned above, without the software drivers from Amkette, the buttons cannot be programmed other than their already assigned functions.Left click, right click, forward and back works well enough. The scroll wheel feels a bit less sensitive in scrolling, almost as if a lag was programmed while scrolling. I am assuming the 2 center buttons are for increasing or decreasing DPI sensitivity, although I have not felt any change in the DPI.::::::::: Update after 15 days of use ::::::::::1. A day after posting my original review,  Software Drivers for the mouse were available for download. I checked whether the mouse can be registered for warranty. Sadly it wasn't.2. A week after posting my review, I was able to register the mouse for warranty as it was listed as their product line-up.3. Minor issue found after regular usage : Everytime I booted the PC / laptop, the mouse seemed to be defaulting to its 1st DPI level. Since I don't regularly change the DPI levels, usually I set the mouse on a comfortable DPI level and re-program the DPI button to do something else depending on the type of work I am doing. But once I am switching off my PC / laptop, the DPI level I have set is defaulting back to DPI Level 1. I have circumvented this by changing the DPI Level 1 to the DPI level I feel comfortable in the software driver itself. I realized later on, that this mouse does not have on-board memory like my Logitech mouse and therefore is reliable on driver setting for its default values."
5,Got it today itself..First impression: Got a very premium look.Nice quality RGB lightning and effect.Elevated keys.Braded cable and magnetic ring.
1,"Was disappointed by this product.1- Packaging was open inside box - there was no seal on box.2- Didn't like the quality of keyboard.3- The USB didn't work on any of the points in laptop.4- Tried contacting support team of Amkette, they were fast with their replies but easily gave up and didn't provide proper support.So I returned the keyboard and got from another company which was much better and worked smoothly plus got a high quality mouse along with keyboard.I would not recommend anyone to buy this Amkette keyboard. The quality testing team is not doing a good job."
5,"I received the item with a surprise gift from the seller which is a gaming mouse by the same brand. About the keyboard, I really can’t comment as this is my first mechanical keyboard, as I have been using controllers for a long while. I didn’t find anything to complain about. Other tenkeyless mechanical keyboards are way to expensive. It works with my PS4 for COD Warzone and Fortnite. Also with my laptop. Mouse is decent too. Thanks."
4,Bought this 6months ago and writting honest reviewPros 1.Best membrane keyboard which has a bit mechanical feel. using this for 6months and its awsome for games and typing 2.Rgb has 2 modes and its sick in this price range(899) 3.Awsome design and compact there is no TKL keyboard in the market at this price range really boosts your setup look.Cons 1.Spacebar feels dumb but i get used to it and its fine now 2.I got a problem that this keyboard jams and pauses mid game when rgb is turned on think its a defect only for me but its  fine i turn it off during some games(problem may be in my usb port not being able to give power for rgb lighting) 3.To make rgb feel nice they used some transparent like color for printing letters which lightly makes it glare if you use it without rgb (with rgb it feels good) 4.Keys are nice to press until now (nearly 7 months) but i guess it may wear over (semi mechanical feel)Nice buy you can buy this if you fixed your budget under 1k otherwise go for cb mechanical @ 2.5k overall satisfied with this product.(Mark usefull if you found it usefull)
4,"Delivery and PackagingI received the keyboard in a pretty limited packaging. It did not come with any cushioning to protect the product either. Moreover the product package had no seal of any sort which made it difficult to determine whether the product is a brand new one or a refurbished one.Typing ExperienceThe typing experience on the keyboard feels quite decent for the price that I got it for (899/-), and provides a decent feedback while typing. Admittedly, I haven't typed on mechanical keyboards before, but I guess this is as close as it gets to it at this price range. It feels like a marked improvement over the keyboard on my laptop which says a lot because my laptop has one of the best laptop keyboards in the market (Thinkpad keyboard). The back-light on the keyboard has three brightness levels and can have three effects (which is honestly useless to me). The colors of the backlight cannot be changed and only the breathing effects can be changed. So please keep that in mind. The backlight can be turned off if necessary, but the caveat is that the texts/numbers on the keys are hardly visible when the backlight is off. I'd have liked to have one color all over the keyboard rather than a gradient of colors, but that is kind of a personal preference. Something to keep in mind, and probably not a big deal for more experienced individuals. The keyboard wasn't difficult to get used to since it's compact and my fingers fall perfectly on the keys. The keys are spaced out quite well. It includes a couple of foldable stands underneath the keyboard that angles it for a better typing experience.Build QualityThe build of the keyboard leaves a lot to be desired. It does not seem durable. I'd be surprised if it lasts me for over a year. One of the screws on the keyboard was already loose and I had to manually screw it back in. A couple of the keys have their keycaps looser than the others. The quality checks on these keyboards don't seem to be too stringent.ConclusionThe price is where the keyboard is forgiven for most of the aforementioned shortcomings. Compared to most keyboards in the price range, it is one of the best and serves it purpose well. I'd recommend it as of the time of writing of the review."
5,Really steardy. Colors is goodNo individual lighting.The wire quality is superb.Dont know if it is relaible or notThe key strokes are goood for a membrane mechanical keyboardIts around 15inches length wise.
1,"Let me tell you all the consFirstly if you are a mechanical keyboard user like meYou should not even look at this product as this product is membrane (feeling of going from a mechanical keyboard to membrane keyboard is noticable)Chances are you will feel like it's hard to press single keyI might say single keystroke requires 90+-5 grams of force to pressThey say it has anti gosting keys(let me tell you the buyers of this product)anti gosting works trash as I said 90+ grams of force to press (keys take time to register)Your hands will pain like hell if you are not used to such cheap keyboardI myself use zebronics max pro mechanical keyboard I switched because my w key brokeIF YOU ARE A GAMER DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL""LONG SESSION OF GAMING MAY INJURE YOU"" I got the product (RETURN AND REFUNDED)"
5,"I have bought a new laptop and started feeling that the in-built keyboard might start to malfunction if I use too much (majorly because of gaming and typing keystrokes). I shortlisted two keyboards for my needs.1. HP K500 Gaming Keyboard (which was priced a bit more above than Rs. 1000, but was quite affordable);2. The Amkette EvoFox FireBlade Gaming Keyboard.I decided to go with the Amkette EvoFox FireBlade as I had bad experiences with HP products in the past (I have a 2nd laptop which is from HP and has keyboard and GPU issues; I got a HP mice and it died within 6 months of usage; and then there are more HP products I've used in the past which had given me pain).I got this keyboard and have been using it for quite a while now, and it is excellent for me at the price I got it for. The keyboard would be an excellent choice for people of both the worlds i.e., for someone who needs it for typing or for someone who needs a gaming keyboard to get started with in the gaming world. For a gaming mice to begin with, you can go for the Logitech G102 Light Sync. Back to the keyboard - The keys are really sturdy. The USB port is very well built. The braided cable (alongwith a magnetic ring) is fantastic too. The keys give an excellent tactile feedback while typing and gaming (as I type and game a lot). It is a TKL keyboard which results in a compact form-factor. You can bring up and down the brightness of backlighting of the keyboard with the Fn + Page Up or Page Down keys. There are shortcuts for multimedia (which is the least used feature for me).I assume it would survive a nuclear disaster or a zombie apocalypse someday (LOL, the keyboard is really good, to be honest). I remember, I accidentally poured a full glass of water and it survived and still works as brand new (LOL, seriously).What could've been a bit better:1. The backlighting. Don't get me wrong, backlighting is bright enough and lights up every key (but don't expect LEDs under each key) but the keyboard has only one mode of backlighting (breathing mode) which is kinda boring and might feel a bit cheap. And then, the right arrow key's backlighting is a bit lower than all the keys' but I am fine with it because of the pricing of the keyboard.2. Now, I would be really nitpicking here considering the price is really cheap but, the keycap of the spacebar is removable and scares me a lot, i.e., I fear it would come off some day if I stress it too much by typing or doing gaming (but thankfully and luckily, still hasn't come off. LOL)Overall feeedback :For someone who is looking to buy a gaming keyboard under Rs. 1000, this is certainly a better buy.  The performance and features it offers surpasses over the things that are needed to be improved. For me, it is a 4.5-star rated keyboard out of 5-stars (0.5 star deducted for the improvements this product needs)."
4,"I Got this beautiful keyboard in a single day delivery and a price of Rs. 1000.  I have been using a mechanical keyboard for some time and must accept that now am a fan of mechanical keyboards due to their smooth typing feel.Since mechanical keyboards have clicky switches, you cannot use them in the places, where you have some colleagues working with you. Due to this reason, I was looking for a keyboard which could provide mechanical feel with less or no noise.After a lot of searches, I zeroed for this one and after using it for a while, I thought of sharing my experience as a review of this keyboard.Starting with the pros, this keyboard provides the right mechanical feel and you do not feel any pain in the fingertips even when you type for longer periods. There is ample space between the keys hence you make fewer mistakes while typing. The keypress is deep and for people who are using mechanical keyboards for this particular reason, will find it satisfying.There is rainbow lighting provided in this keyboard which means every key has a fixed color LED behind it and you cannot change it. You cannot set a single color for the whole keyboard (which by the way is a feature of higher versions of the gaming keyboards). For people like me who are using this for typing and coding purposes lighting do not come to picture at all. I do not keep the lights open at all, even if they look beautiful and HI-FI but they may interfere in your concentration while typing. You can switch on/off the backlight using a dedicated key provided for that in the keyboard, also you can change the lighting modes using the Fn+ pg up/down buttons.For gamers, there is also a windows lock key, which means you can lock the windows key, which sometimes kill the gaming experience by popping up the start menu.Coming to the keystrokes, the keys are soft enough and not much clicky. It is somewhat near to the Cherry MX Brown/ red versions of the mechanical keys. It produces less noise but still, when you click the space bar there is some sound.The plastic used in the keyboard look decent (as per the price), the cable (around 4ft) is braided one which means it is entangling free. There is also a height raiser provided at the backside which helps you increase the height of the keyboard to provide a good typing experience.For the limitations part of this keyboard, as of now, I have not found anything which I could mention on the negative side. However in future, if I come across any cons, I will put them up here.Overall, it is a great buy for gamers as well as coders like me. Its a bang for the buck."
4,"At this price, it is a fairly good mouse.PROS:Value for MoneyLooksRGB LightingBuild QualityCONS:Bit HeavyThis mouse carries some weight. Choose wisely.If you are person who loves light mouse, this is not for you.Plus, the Firefox Software is not available in Amkette store but the link is given on package.It's not an signed exe package. Don't know why!! Windows will show few security pop-ups, skip through those, its OK to install.Its has very basic UI but does the job."
5,"This product is really amazing in every aspect.I needed a backlit keyboard for my laptop, as it lacks one, and this keyboard is just perfect for me.Moreover, though its not mechanical, but it feels and sounds just like one.Cable - Nylon coated Braided cable. Very strong.The USB pin is also very well built and looks very sturdy.Lighting - 3 levels of brightness + you can on/off the rgb lights as per your need. This is already brilliant in this price range, don't expect ultra-premium features at this price.For an idea about the size of the laptop, it is about the same size (in length) as my 15.6 inch laptop's inbuilt keyboard.I got it for 750 Rs in amazon great indian festival with lightning deal at 900 rs + rs 150 off due to rupay debit card. I am really happy to get this epic deal.Trust me, its the best keyboard you will ever find in this price range."

4,Using it with my MacBook works fine. The cPs lock light has gone off within few hrs of use. Caps lock is working though. I use it for regular work not gaming. Keys are smooth but noisy as compared to regular logitech keyboards. Lights look good.Previous logitech mk275 wireless stopped working in a year. So went with this product. So far so good.It's just my first day of using this for regular office work.Form factor is a great space saver.
4,Keyboard Looks like a Expensive Mechanical  keyboard. But actually it is a Membrane Keyboard. Keys are raised by Spring. Using it for 10 days. Its working good. Playing games.  There are only 2 light effects. Still and Breathing. And brightness can be changed. Adequate Bright not too much. Corners of the keyboard Are little less bright.  Its fully Plastic.  Not too light weght though. Good quality for 999 rupees.  Lets see how long it lasts.  Cable is breaded. Keyboard is small size looks good. I like it. Box pack was bad. No sealing.
1,"Writing review after 2 Months of use.Some buttons has become hard. I am into programming. I type a lot. When i try to press some buttons it doesn't press sometimes. It has become thay much hard.Some dust might get collected below keys and made it rough. But the real problem is non detectable keys.After keys get hard, i have to throw it away. There is no option to clean it. Even i had mailed to their support team . But they are busy only in selling products.Seems like TYPICAL CHINEESE PRODUCT.DON'T GO FOR IT. It's just a matter of time you will start to face problems and you have to throw it in dustbin."

3,"Let's start with what's good: It compactthat's it.key size felt kind of ok for me as I'm habituated to larger key size and prefer them, it braided cable but the quality is low, the same goes for built quality and key pressing feedback.So to sum it up if the keyboard cost around 600(based on built (quality) I would be ok or if there was no better keyboard at 900(its price when I bought it)."
3,"I bought this back in June and have been using it for almost around 3 months now. So far, the keyboard still works fine but for its price I definitely think it could have been of better quality.The pictures are definitely somewhat deceiving as it doesn't look as premium when you get the actual product. The paint job seems very cheap and the RGB lighting is very subpar. Stand outs though, it is a TKL (no Numpad) so for gamers who have less desk space, this is definitely a great keyboard.It definitely is anti-ghosting - so that's a plus. Hope Amkette looks into making their products look and feel more premium for the price because I feel like this keyboard could have easily been sold for 500-600 rupees. If you're willing to increase your budget by an extra 200-300 rupees, go for another product is my final verdict. I'll try to wear this keyboard as much as I can before purchasing a new one."
3,"Not happy with keyboard, returned it an hour after I got itI was actually looking forward to using this keyboard because of its reviewsThe keys on the keyboard shake a lot and are very flimsy, they wobble too much and when they do so, it sounds like Lego blocks moved around in a boxIf I press the keys in the center of the keyboard the whole keyboard dips into the center and that shows its pathetic build qualityWhen I typed using it, my speed was better, meaning it could be used for gaming due to its low latency ,but gamers need sturdy keyboards tooThe paint job is super bad, you could make out errors on the many keysThe RGB lighting looks good, but can be better with more color optionsAlso when I click on the 'E' key, both the D and E key gets pressed, so a big no for typistsAlso when my brother was playing Valorant, during the game the keyboard started malfunctioning, like if you hold W, you're supposed to move forward, but in this keyboard if you hold W, the game registers it as if I'm spamming W a few times in a second, so the character doesn't move constantly but keeps stopping and moving forwardVerdict: Dont go for it dear gamers and typists, the redgear blaze manta is a better option in the same price rangeVerdict : don't go for it, won't last long"

1,"If you are looking for a good keyboard with good feedback and comfortable ergonomics, then look elsewhere.This is a keyboard which would not make you happy.First and foremost, the build quality is absolutely shambolic. The paint is of low quality. There no defined lines. The letter start vanishing within 6 months. The buttons are loose and tacky. Shake the keyboard a little and you will knowSecondly, the feedback on this keyboard is extremely poor. The buttons get stuck while typing often.The response time is very poor for gaming too.The lighting is just a set of 5 LED lights under the keyboard with fixed colour.I regret buying this.Just look elsewhere for a quality keyboard."
2,this keyboard is really good for its price. Its keys are really good and it is great for gaming.I am giving it 2 stars because after 2 months of normal use it has stopped working properly.When I plug it in all the lighting effects work but I cant type anything. The keys won't register on all the devices I've tried. Also I contacted amkette around 1 month ago and they still haven’t replied.
3,"Ohh boy I expected something great but for 1000rs I would say okThe keys lit up well and they do a great job showing the key character at night (some don't show it that well ..It's a sparay painted nad laser removed the outline so if you scrape off the plack stuff you might actually illuminate the damage aswellYou can do this cool thing just signed your name using a sharp tool now the signature illuminates (I said ""you can "" but don't do it if you want to loose your warrenty )(It's a 3 mothns warranty not 1year )The keys sound no where like mechanical and doesn't even feels mechanical they key travel is very impressive so I give props to that .If you have big Hands avoid this the key caps are a bit smallAnd the part where the wire attached to the keyboard is flimsy and I think might wear down quickly.Braided babel but it's for show it's early tearing apart at the junction .Over all for 1000rs -OKbetter buy this at 800-850rs"
4,"The mouse is good, it's fast and fancy, a bit heavy but makes gaming experience a lot better. My family have been using Amkette products for over two decades now, I still have their Floppy Disks (a square thing before everything), also my last amkette wireless keyboard-mouse combo lasted 8 years..the mouse still works. Coming back to this Evo Fox mouse, there are technically better gaming mouse available in market for the same budget but I'm not sure they'll last long as most of them have poor quality check and you'll endup wasting alot of time and money in just claiming warranty. My expectation is that Evo Fox devices will last longer than others in the segment."
5,"Review- I use this for playing Minecraft pep. With the provided software I am able to program the mouse properly. All 7 buttons work perfectly now. Very comfortable and Stylish Mouse and the delivery was quick too.All what I can say is, this is a must buy product for budget gamers."
5,"I needed an interim key now which I would have to use for games like Dota 2, Cyberpunk etc. Got this till I thought I would save up for a much better keyboard. I was coming from a Logitech 402 which had stopped working so the quality and downgrade response from the key switches (or all thereof) were immediately noticeable. However, over time, this keyboard grew on me and now I’ll be keeping this one for a while.Would not recommend for people who type a lot but for gamers, sure. The lighting can either be off or have different levels of brightness but is not customisable. Don’t expect more at this price range.It’s fairly light but seems decently durable.If you’re on a tight budget and are primarily getting a keyboard for gaming, this one is recommended, hands down"

4,"PROS:1) Small and compact2)brightness of RGB well3) comfortable for eyes4)cable is braided, hence tangle free5)plastic and key quality good6) mechanical keysCONS1)no numpad 1-202) only TWO RGB options (fixed and breathing with fixed speed)3) green, red, blue from left to right--that is colour are placed in fixed positions4) Since no keys just right to arrow keys, you will definitely miss those shortcut buttons for JUMPPING/CROUCH etc which you are used to many games"
5,"I didn't want a Chinese product which market is flooded from and hence looked at it. This is from Amkette an Indian company. The Product is very durable, braided cord of one meter. Brightness of leds is very good. The mouse works straight out of the box without any additional software but if you wish to customize you can install the software as per instructions given on the box. It comes with two fox evo stickers.Size of the mouse is medium a little larger than most wireless mouse and it glides very well on a standard mouse pad with its Teflon / Rubber coating on bottom.Feedback of the clicks is very nice and wheel is super precise too. Forward and backward buttons work without any customization and I found them very useful while chatting on MS-Teams as you can switch forward and backward to a previous chat, which was not possible for me before.USB fits snuggly into laptops ports. Over all a very nice product and worth purchase at this price of 650. Go for it if you like and support make in India products."
5,"Just received the keyboard today. Packaging was really good (took me a while to open it lol 😆). Delivery guy was awesome. Was really quick and accurate on the address. So great service 👍. The keyboard itself is sturdy. As a professional web designer myself, which involves a lot of typing this keyboard certainly serves the purpose. Typing is smooth. The backlit keys are good and has a nice breathing effect, although I generally don't care about LEDs but its a plus. Gaming on this keyboard feels great since it's a gaming keyboard. Those 19 anti-ghosting keys are really handy while playing any Assassin's Creed games or Saints Row IV while involves a lot of running and jumping at the same time. All in all I'm very happy with the product."
1,"The product when ordered came defective most of the keys not workingTried contacting the support (Amkette) no response from their side, better buy another keyboardthe build was also not good"
4,"Only the spray painting below the keys is not at all good. Looks like it has been done by an ignorant amateur. Green Red Blue colours are static. AWSD keys area remain green, Space bar area is red and cursor keys area is blue. Only breathing effects of lights under keys and no colour change. Good keyboard to learn typing. Keys don't make loud clicking noise when pressed. Braided cable is long. Occupies less space and costs less so one can buy."
3,"See in this range you will get another option this mouse ia good for work purpose and for slow accuracy/DPI game like war thunder Snipe mode, But for game like PUBG it sucks at aiming and button are little hard. Downside rubber grip is not smooth as compair to other mouse. Its create grip on mat( I have razor Mat) which dont give smooth movement. My previous mouse is Razer Taipan, may for that i am disappointed."
5,It's motion detector aka the thing under the mouse sometimes is more working or sometimes is less... Sometimes it's senstivity is like 20 or at the same time it can be 100 BUT that isn't the good point. The good point is that me and all my friends praised this mouse unlike a mouse of zebronics I bought earlier. It is a bit like sticky so I have problems cleaning my mouse but ok. I use it for editing and playing games. So my suggestions are - You SHOULD buy it. It is total worth of your money. And the design is just so awesome to my eyes...
2,"KEYBOARDPros----1. Metal top and thick plastic base makes it very strong and minimum deck flex.2. Raised keycaps and tactile membrane keys. IT'S NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD.3. Long braided cable with strong USB connector.4. Decent rubber pads to stop slipping on the desk.5. Windows lock and RGB light brightness control buttons.6. Interchangeable WASD and Arrow Keys.Cons----1. Input gets stuck sometimes even if the keys are not stuck. Happens about 4 times in 24 hours on average.2. Sometimes input is not registered.3. Keys are not equally tactile. Space bar takes a lot of effort.4. Only 3 light colour combination, no effects. Forget about software synchronisation.5. It's NOT TRULY BACKLIT, key labels are not visible by the light, only the key gaps are lit.6. Packaging is bad.MOUSEPros----1. Ergonomic and grippy design, easy to hold for medium and large hands.2. Metal base allows smooth movement and weight to the mouse.3. 6 buttons - Left/Right/Scroll/DPI/Forward/Backward4. 4 DPI settings 1000/1600/2400/3200 through cycling.5. Long braided cable with stroNg USB connector.Cons----1. Sometimes input is not registered.2. Metal base is not removable if you prefer light mouse.3. Only RGB breathing effect, nothing else.4. Forget about any other features at this price with RGB.I bought this about a month ago and it's running good. The build quality is very strong, you can kill a person with the keyboard. The packaging is very bad, resulting in a lot of people getting damaged products.Even though there's issues with inputs for both the mouse and keyboard, it never happened during my daily 4 hour gaming binge. However, I don't recommend this for intense FPS gaming as it can be difficult to hold the mouse for very fast movements for a long time.The RGB is okay but the money could have been used for adding other features or making the existing ones better, or at least they could've made the key-labels visible by the light. I do not recommend buying this at Rs.1600 as there are other better alternatives available at that price or a little more, like the Cooler Master keyboard-mouse combo. Buy this if you get a sale where the price is closer to Rs.1000.Edit: As of 02/02/2020, the '1' and 'Z' keys from the alpha-numeric set have stopped working. I have reduced the ratings as the problems mentioned above have increased and new problem has come up. The mouse works fine, but if clicked too hard, next click won't register. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying at more than half the price, save more money and buy other better options."
5,"Okay, so I got this combo today. The packaging was a bit bad. The box was deformed at some point, but the keyboard and mouse were in excellent condition.Talking about the product, the build quality is awesome. The breathing LEDs are a charm. The mouse is way too smooth. The keyboard keys don't wobble and give somewhat a mechanical feel.In short, the headline is 100% right. Just go for it !"
5,"I was a bit skeptic at first when this was on offer for 1200rs, as i don't usually trust reviews here. but must say this one blew my expectations and i have a new found respect for reviewers too.The quality of the keyboard and the mouse is very good better than good i must say.The LED features could have been more elaborate well any ways u can turn them off on both the devices.(On the mouse long press the Dpi button to turn off the LED). ps-found it the hard way.STURDY, BEAUTIFUL AND VALUE FOR UR EVERY PENNY."
4,"This really a worth deal for 1150 which I got this pair of keyboard and mouse for . So now first of all I received this package 1 day after the estimated day the packaging was really bad and was making some noises then I found that there were two screws which were unscrewed in the process of shipping or something . The ergonomics of mouse is really good it just fits perfectly in my hands the buttons on the mouse pretty good but two side buttons are really clumsy to click I have accidentally the button I don't want to click like 1/5 times the keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling the wires are really good they are braided and have gold plating on the male usb end ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of individual key but you can try few zone lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights"
2,"While using in a room full of light this keyboard is value for money;However when you use it in a dark room, you cannot see what you are typing unless you are pretty used to typing without seeing.The keys are not backlit, the RGB lights are there but you still cannot see anything on the keyboard in a dark room."
4,The product is very good ..... Elite keyboard under fair price .....But the MRP isn't 2599... But it is 1599 (as shown behind the box).
5,Amazing build qualityAluminum build qualitySwitches are tactile and nice and solid feelMouse dpi is amazing very fast response rate for games like csgo and fortnite
5,"If your in a budget, you will really appreciate this combo.. This is one of the best that you can get.. If you can find it around or less than 1200, buy it in local shop. Bcuz, amazon ships this product is an extremely bad shape. Ive bought 3 of these in the past 2 to 3 years. 1 from local which was good. And 2 from amazon which was damaged a bit. Since there was a local service center I was able to get it replaced. If u dnt get a damaged one, then you'll definitely love this. Some pros and cons after using for 2 years.Pros:Stylish metallic lookKeys and mouse buttons are really durableAlthough it's membrane, key press is really smooth and silent.Mouse bottons are smooth and thumb buttons are easy to reach and would be grt while gaming.Sensors are very decent and will be perfectly fine unless you are a professional gamer.Keyboard has 3 adjustable height.If you feel the mouse to be heavy, you can remove the side and bottom plates but it'll void warranty.Cons:Scroll wheel will definitely fail at one point but this was not an issue for me as this can be fixed easily. Checkout YouTube for this.The rgb lights are pointless. Lights are behind the keys and keys doesn't allow light through them so you can't see the keys in a dark room.The package always arrives in a damaged state. So you gotta be lucky to get an undamaged piece.There's no software so mouse will always have a breathing light effect and keyboard has 2 to 3 modes which can't be modified. But this can't be considered a con for a product at this price and I always keep the lights off.Apart from these minor cons, the functionality and performance of this product is outstanding."
1,Ofcourse it looks well lit but the performance is poor. I got this product and after 2 weeks the scroll key in mouse started malfunctioning. After a month the keyboard started malfunctioning. If you consider budget wise you can buy this... But if you want to use it for a prolonged period of time then this product is not suited for you. Just after a month buying this product now I'm gonna have to buy a new keyboard and mouse.Not Satisfied with this product!
3,"I was wondering that it will be good thing to work during dark or night without disturbing others but it doesn't show up the keys, during dark and make difficult to identify the keys, lights glow below the keys and keys not made transparent so that it also glow. I later purchased other keyboard to solve my issue, I didn't return this because my son liked it due to changing light patterns and he use the desktop to play games or drawing."
1,Got in two days after ordering.. packaging was worst ever.. keyboard was damaged from outside.. slight 4 bends on body and a lot of scratches on back.. came in wet condition.. didn’t applied for replacement because it was working fine and also think that i was waste of time as it takes week to exchange.. be carefull although the product is goof..Edit: after giving one star.. it stops taking image in review..
1,"Why people are giving positive reviews to this mouse. Durability is good but problem is with the comfort and sensor. Normal mouse is better than this.This is not for gaming, It has a high lift off distance which is very much annoying while gaming. After 30mins of gaming my wrist hurts, so comfort is very bad.It is a very bad choice for gamers.I bought g402 instead of this."
5,"The mouse some times doesn't connect for 1 sec but is fine later (happens rarely but it does) isn't a big problem. Also, the mouse is really good cause my last mouse scratched my laptop's surface and the second I put it on my laptop it slid so smoothly. I recommend you buy this for a Laptop or a PC. The cable is long enough so that if my laptop is connected with HDMI to my TV I could still put my back by the bed and play normally(really helpful).The Keyboard has good lights too and is comfortable even when put on laps. It took some days but I got used to typing on this keyboard (as am a fast typer that was awfully quick for me. though it could have been better though that would increase the price a lot."
5,"I purchased this for 1100. Yeah was a steal at the price! Coming to the product, the build quality is top notch and this certainly doesn't feels like a super budget set. Just hold it on your hands and you'll know what I'm trying to say. Aluminium used and it looks so freaking good!The mouse does the job well too and the extra buttons can be easily maped. I use this in competitive FPS like Apex Legends, CS GO, PUBG etc and this comes in real handy. However note it'll take time for you to get used to it. It's a bit heavy to use but once you're used to it, there's no issue.A few things I didn't like were that LEDs weren't lit in the keys but just the gaps. I mean it still looks great but if you wanna use it in the dark, you wouldn't be able to see. Also the space bar takes a lil effort. The mouse is perfect and there's nothing to crib about there.However the packaging was just ""BAD"". Please look after it AMAZON.  I don't know why they did it but I just got the keyboard box without any wrapping or protection. ( It was a bit damaged from the the sideS too, Thank God the components were safe xD ).Nonetheless, it's a steal for 1100 or even 1200-1300. Full 5 stars from my side considering the price."
5,THIS IS THE BEST KEYBOARD AND MOUSE I HAVE EVER SEEN PLAESE GO FOR IT AS IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN HAVE IN SO MUCH LESS PRICE IF IT WERE OF EVEN 5000 RUPEES THEN TOO I WONT BE SHOCKEDP.S - YOU DONT GET TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL KEYBOARD AND MOUSE QUALITY EVEN IN THE PHOTOS GIVEN BY AMAZON  OR ON THE REVIEWS IN THE YOUTUBE. WHEN YOU GET THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD THEN YOU GET TO KNOW THAT THE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PLEASE CONSIDER TO BUY

1,"A super cheap keyboard mouse combo.Mouse:Pros:1. Main buttons are good. Tactile feel is okayish.2. Pretty responsive mouse.Cons:1. Light as a feather. Needs to have some weight, some minimum weight.2. Airy Side buttons though they work have no feel. People who experienced these kind of buttons can tell, they don't last more than a few days and also you can't physically feel any click, absolutely zero tactile feel except for a very faint click sound. So these are not really useful in gaming. You don't normally see these buttons anywhere, I saw these only once before on a very cheap Chinese made FM radio set as a on/off button.3. Metal back plate will scratch your table.Mouse Rating: 3/5 for this price.Keyboard:Pros:Feel is somewhat mechanical.Cons:1. Very elevated: The metal plate lies flat on table and keys are very elevated. It's insanely difficult to type keeping your wrist straight. While gaming there is zero wrist support. Wrist starts to pain in a few minutes. Carpel tunnel is guaranteed. See pics attached.2. The keyboard came very dusty and seems like used, see close up images attached.3. The RGB is only RGB not key backlight. What do I mean, light comes from the gaps but not from the letters on the keyboard. Meaning you cannot see illuminated ABC etc, only light from all around the keys but actual keys don't glow. See pics attached.4. There is no shread of ergonomics in the keyboard.Keyboard Rating: 0/5Okay mouse. Keyboard only good to hang as an RGB decoration."

4,"People who just started gaming i think this will suit you the best,the keys are very good you will get a good typing experience.Only thing that expected for more rgb light modes it has just 3 multicolored still modes and a breathing effect it would be best if it has rainbow and ripple effect.update after 1 year and few months: keyboard has stopped working , i notice some connection issues with the cable. mouse is fine."
5,"Pros.That RGB light 😍It was well known keyboard and mouse set. It was wonderful addition to your setup.Mouse buttons are clicky with satisfying sound. Keyboard keys are well spaced and easy to type fast.Cons.Keyboard buttons should have been backlit, it would be wonderful if it has. But this is what given.Overall best purchase and add a little spice up to my WFH setup."
5,"To be honest, the pics didn't satisfy me before purchase. I was not planning on buying this one, but the reviews changed my mind. I ordered it on Friday and got it on Sunday of the same week. The quality is just mind blowing, It has a grey aluminium like finish and works perfectly on Mac's. The RGB on the mouse and keyboard is just beautiful. The RGBin the keyboard has 3 modes. Both the keyboard and mouse have gold plated usbs and braided cables, so u don't have to worry about them tangling. The mouse has the same finish as the keyboard, and feels premium on hand. I don't know much about keyboard keys, but these feel way better than those 800Rs mechanical keyboards you get locally. The brightness and dpi have there own buttons on the devices. The keyboard even has a '₹' key. I will be honest with you, it looks better than the pics. There just isn't a better combo than this at this price."
5,"This is perfectly a premium gaming mouse. Very comfortable and sturdy build. If you play games for a long time you will absolutely have no complain, very comfortable to hold. The breathing LED lights make it more attractive and the two side buttons allows you a more powerful gaming.Thanks Amazon and Zebronics"
5,"I am not a gamer and haven't taken this for gaming purpose, I was looking for a top quality Keyboard Mouse Combo where I think Zebronics did a near perfect Job.I wasn't looking for anything else apart from a performance. This Keyboard does a decent job than ther Dell wireless & Logitech does. Keys are very well placed and ideal spacing of letters. Top notch quality of cables and length too which is very much required in wired devices.Mouse is also excellent and does a pretty good job. It certainly adds value to your Home Office. The back and forward button on the mouse is a very very useful feature.Rest all is gimick of that lights but it's not well crafted.. Truly Value for money."
5,"My kid specifically asked for this for gaming after seeing it at his friends' place. But given more school work/studies going online, it is a good full size keyboard for kid to minimize wrist fatigue. It is really good and in kid's words -- ""satisfying"" especially from mechanical type of feeling. Mouse is very cool too.  The smile on kid's face makes is a must buy for parents. Moreover it is an Indian brand so very proud of it too. It looks futuristic too from ""transformers theme"" styling perspective and subtle LED lighting. Quick delivery by Amazon despite lockdown etc. Big thank you and hi-five to Amazon and Zebronics."
5,"Its one of the best things i have purchased from amazon, build quality is nice, price is good, remember that its a milti light setting that means three diffrent color of light will be there on the keyboard at any particular time which is not that nice, in place of that if they would have gone with one color at a time thatw ould be nice other wise go for it"
5,About keyboardBest for gamingBest for typingWhile playing games you've to decrease your brightness otherwise you'll get RGB light's rays that will distract you too much...Increasing and decreasing brightness option i like it too muchThis is very affordable keyboard you can go for itAnd one more thing the keyboard body is that much powerful you can defend yourself while alien invasion..About mouseMouse has 2 LED lights inside its body and one of them is too annoying it's very eye catchy and annoyingYou can't increase and decrease the lights of the mouseThey should have given that option in mouse too but yeah don't worry about that too much because every person has different perspective i said mine but i believe me you can go for it..Apart from that mouse buttons are so cool while playing it's like you're in ufo and you're controlling it by the mouse.. actually it's button the quality itself is very different like matte finish and because of RGB lights you'll feel about that ufo stuff which I've said...Very good mouse and keyboardGo for it blindlyDon't waste your money in high price keyboard and mouseIt all work the sameAnd this one is very cool.
5,GAMING:- If you want gaming/Basic use/Heavy use Keyboard & Mouse .Just go for it. It has RGB colors. DURABALITY:-And much tough quality.Aluminium body. Dpi settings for mouse. For more info refer zebronics website. DISADVANTAGE:- You cannot see Alphabets & number on buttons in the night even if you on rgb lights. FEEDBACK:- Your selling product in india so recommend you guys to add rupee symbol
1,The product is supposed to work for at least 12 months. but stopped working after 4 months. Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer wanted to to visit their service center which is about 30 kilometers away on the other side of the city. It will cost me time and probably more money  than the product's price. overall appalling service from both.

5,"So as I told you that there is one secret function that no-one knows but before I tell you,this keyboard and mouse combo is best for work and some what good for gaming if you want to add RGB look to your setup so now I  revel that function that I also discovered it accidentally if you want to turn off the led of mouse there's no key for that only you can change DPI but along that if you press and hold that DPI key for 4-5 sec RGB led goes off this is not mentioned in manual also hope you liked this review"
5,Got this for ~₹1500. Great value for money. Pros: Very good. Strong metal body that can take punishment. Keycaps also feel durable.Has good travel. Don't feel like you have have to hit hard to register keysMouse is also decent with good sensitivity switchLighting is pleasantKeycaps can be replaced easilyAcceptable response timesCons:Membrane keyboard (Acceptable for given price point)Lights are not programmableKeycaps do not let light pass so keys are almost invisibleNo mousepad or palm rest(acceptable for price point)
5,"Under 300 rupees, this is best you can get.pros:full size keyboarddecently smooth keysless noise while typingrupee key presentinclined hinges for comfortable typingCons:wire length enough but less compared to other keyboardsno multimedia keys"
5,"Very good keyboard. Build quality is pretty good. Also has a good egronomical design and is sleek too. Keys are not too flat and at the same time not too bulky as well. Has a soft touch key press action that makes typing comfortable and smooth. Only drawback is that it does not have the LED light indicators for caps lock,  scroll lock and num lock and also no rubber bushes under the keyboard to prevent it from moving while typing. Otherwise this is a really good product for the price that it's being offered on amazon."
4,"Value for money product! Keys are not so soft, but good to work with it! As mentioned its splash proof but at the right top corner where 3 LED lights are placed for notifications of Alphabet lock, number lock and scroll lock there you can see a small gap in which there are more chances of water getting in and spoil the keyboard! However considering the price point it is the best in this segment! Go for it! Carbon fiber texture gives a extra premium look! Good to go!"
2,"The keyboard is very lightweight, however, it does not have the rubber grips at the base. So, the frictionless plastic bottom (raised 2cm² of it) against hard wood surface.. makes it a very annoying formula.It's flimsy, non-standard layout - minor issues that user could live with.. but this keyboard grip being skipped is horrendous choice at manufacturer's part. Then again, it's made in China and you can't explain any QA/QC at this price point."
1,This is the most bad product in the world. 😠.Just waste my money. Now I have to buy a key board again. The key are totally not working properly. I have to press it again and again but sometimes it types more then one latter or something it types nothing I hate it. Do not buy it at all. 😠😠. Amazon please review it and sell atleast that product which is working properly.
1,"Dont buy, even in 100 rupees it is costlier, cheap plastic material."
5,"Pros:1. Quite economical (also because am only using till lockdown... hence the keyboard looks as if will work good till next 7-8 months for sure).2. Good keyboard i.e.,, the keyboard material, keys, and nearly all keys are present.3. Light-weight.Cons:1. The keys make noise.2. Function key not present.3. No LED lights for caps or NUM lock keys.4. Looks like minor issue with Ctrl key, you need to press it twice/thrice to get it back to working.5. Key with radio sign (wifi/airplane mode) not present.But for this price range cons SHOULD be ignored.I've another keyboard from another seller for Rs. 700-750, but after 1 year of usage, it's letters print has started to fade n keys make noise... doesn't looks like worth the money."
2,Did not work as expected. Repeat rate could not be set and it always prints too many characters for each key press. Hence could not type.Returned for exchange. Can confirm its quality after the replacement.
1,"Used/discarded product sent, keys are jammed, full of dust, and non functional.  Package was of Quantum but product of Intex. Is Amazon now resorting such lower means to earn money? Sending any rubbish to customers after charging money......shocking"
5,The keyboard is soft and tactile like a very high quality keyboard. At the same time it completely justifies the quality it provides.Dont see much difference between this and the Dell keyboard I use at office.Great deal for the money you pay.
1,13th may delivered.. it was working fine for 10days..later started giving prob..if I press any key it is taking 2 times... If I press q it is taking qq.. not worth!Now 10days over and I cant return also.Go for Logitech.. expensive but worth!!!
2,"As soon as a month of usage, the keys started to become mushy and a single press triggers multiple entries and makes my typing experience very bad. literally, almost all the markings of the alphabets in the keys are gone for e now in just a month. don't buy if you can save extra 200 money to buy a keyboard. this is ok if you don't have more money to buy."
5,Very very light weight and it moves up m down when you when you start typing.  You will feel to exchange it however just within an hour or so of usage you will get accustomed to this keyboard and start appreciating it for the money it comes for. No problem whatsoever
2,I am writing after using for 2 months.. keyboard is not working..it used to connect to pc but not it's not working with the same PC.. I used it for only one pc..
1,Worst product I ever bought till now from Amazon  keyboard didn't meet my expectations and most importantly the reason for 1 start is is the poor quality of keybord ..while using keyboard it used to disconnect on own and then reconnect again in 3-4 seconds and the keys I pressed in between this used to get spammed and it disturbs a lot cause then u have to cut everything and write again and if u play games then if the key doesn't get response then there is just no use of keybord ...worst experience .. disappointed by quantum and from not I'll never buy quantum product I'll rather but zebronics it's 10 times better working than quantum 😤
5,"Nice keyboard,,, but I suggest you to buy by watching the palm rest keyboard,, to which you can type much easier...This keyboard is less palm rest space while continuously typing your hand will tired.. I watched later after ordering this, else I'll also go for that keyboard which has much space for palm rest,,,,Overall very nice keyboard,, I typed by taking the rest of table for palm"
4,"For under Rs. 500, this keyboard is well-built and of good quality. The keys are working fine. One downside is that it lacks those rubber stoppers on the bottom which causes it to slip and move around while typing. Otherwise, a very good product!"
2,"Low quality in cheap price.  Light weight and not in sync with surface are the drawbacks. While typing fast, keyboard seems dancing. Keyboard is elevated from the surface. Need to put more pressure on wrist n fingers while typing. Get a better one may be costlier if you are looking for a comfortable keyboard, or go with this if money matters."
3,Don't know id this is the case of mine only or overall but mine sometimes just doesn't work or the pc cannot read it while booting up and i would have to re-plug several times indifferent ports on my Gigabyte B450M DS3H motherboard which is very much annoying and frustrating at the same time.Rest it is a good keyboard for normal usage no problem whatsoever to date from October 2020.
1,Received damaged at bottom right corner. Build Quality is visibly not good. Don't buy.
2,"Poor quality. Its been 2 months, 7 letters already lost their prints. Many others are loosing theirs. I dont know what happened to the UV coating they applied. After a while half of the keys lose their prints. You are left to wonder what letter is where..."
5,"Right Shift key stuck all of the time, I thought it is manufacturing defect so I replaced but I noticed the same problem in replaced keyboard too. I think with this series keyboard design Engineer did blunder mistake while designing. Poor Keyboard please don't waste your money."
5,"The keyboard has been functioning perfectly from the very beginning till now/ I am sorry to say the previous one was defective. that is the a thing of the past, so let it be. Thanks ."
3,I was just looking for a temporary cheap solution. So bought this one. Though the Cable was broken and had to put electric tape. But keyboard works and delivered before time so I give 3/5. Will keep it and won't return.
4,"Very good keyboard, for basic use. Keys are spacious and soft touch. I am giving 4 stars since the packaging was not good and the corner of the keyboard is broken although it didn't affect the functionality"
2,Product seems ok at the price range but packaging of product was not satisfactory. It arrived with tampered state and with no extra care to prevent damage. Package was also not wrapped in Amazon box. I feel seller takes order for granted.
1,"It's the worst  keyboard I have ever used .Just after few days of light use , the keys become very hard and it's not usable now.My advise :Don't buy this keyboard at all."
5,Always I am very happy to Amazon and it's sellers. The product is excellent and it's works smoothly. The wire is something thin but it is well as this price. I strongly recommend to this product to bye.Lastly thank you Amazon and it's seller to provide me good product.
1,Some of the keys do not work unless the device is plugged out and back in. it is a Chinese product. :(
4,It is in working condition. The USB connection works fine. It did not take much effort to connect it and start using it.Reason for 4 stars: It looked a little old as if it has been used before.
3,"The keyboard looks and feels very flimsy. The design is also not super ergonomic. I went for a cheap one, should not have. Not very user friendly."
3,Good at this price of 300 .....but not good for tying as other keys got pressed while typing.....instead one should buy zebronic 500 rupees keyboard which has spaces between keys
3,"Product was lightweight and very thin, can't be used for long term, can be used as temporary, not value for money...😒😒...product packaging was good..and fast delivery.."
1,The product stopped working after 3 days of minim use and it is neither value for money nor it has appropiate quality. I wish to return it as soon as possible!
1,Got spoiled within 2 weeks of purchase. and even after having warranty the vendor does not respond
1,"the keyboard is malfunction  2, or more than 2 characters are coming on1 single keypress. some key need to press very hard, some key is showing multiple characters on a single keypress. I didn't check the keyboard on receiving the order, I bought it for the backup keyboard but when I try to use it it is not working"
1,Keyboard was broken from outside.very cheap quality spend 100 or 200 more but go for good quality products keys are getting stucked automatically while pressing them don't go for it guyssss
4,"It’s ok. Can’t say too good quality or compare to other brands, but it’s ok if you don’t want to spend more."
3,"So I ordered this one on 18th Aug 21 and today is 17th Sep 21. As you can see in the picture posted, the alphabets print is clearing out. Though the look and feel is good, but i guess the attractive low price of the product is taken down by it quality."
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ₹350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren’t workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
1,"This was my first Amkette product and I was in a desperate need of a keyboard given the WFH scenario. I usually read a lot of reviews before going in for a purchase and to be honest I did do a bit a research on this purchase as well. However, given the urgency, I probably cut a few corners in my product research. And I am suffering the consequences of it.Coming to the problem at hand, the first key to give up was the Shift. Then, after a few days 9,6 and 3 on the numpad gave up. I am at a point now wherein I get gifts in the form of a new key giving up every day.Can you imagine the horror, for someone who works in the IT industry, of not having a properly functioning keyboard. I am throwing this one out the day my new keyboard arrives."
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
3,"I ordered this keyboard back in june 2019. Within a year my numerical keys above the alphabet keys stopped working. And recently the shift keys and some of the other special character keys have also stopped working. For the price it is worth it if you are in a pinch and need a new keyboard, like I did. But I would recommend against getting it as a gaming keyboard or hoping that with will last for years."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
3,"Overall good and functional but build quality is flimsy. The image is a bit misleading in terms of build quality. Not gamed yet, but all keys are working. Note that the ₹ key will work with English India pack only. Its pretty good if you tend to work or play in total darkness but don't have the budget for a good quality backlit board. The plastic used is so cheap and feeble that even normal typing bends the board."
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ₹300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard 😂. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
1,"If you really want low budget Keyboard please go for zebronics or quantum.. I would recommend Logitech or TVS if you dont have budget idea. As I have a PS/2 Logitech keyboard for 13 years till now working well.For budget dont go for Amkette...I bought it for 275 thinking i saved money a lot. But It stopped working after 1.5 year but i  used that very very rarely..Most of the time it was unplugged and idle and untouched..So i cannot claim warranty .So i opened the keyboard and i was shocked there is only a tiny low quality toy microcontroller chip which will easily stop working if we drop the toy..Just like that of you drop the keyboard , there is high chance that it will stop work .I have dropped the logitech literally so many times but still it is working good. The quality is so so poor that the real manufacturing value of the amkette keyboard will not exceed hundred ruppess... The chip , soldering is so low quality .and low standard... Dont buy this keyborad if it is beyond 250rs.. And dont buy this if you have chances of dropping it.. The usb voltage fluctuation if occurred might also affect the chip very easily.. Go for branded please... Now the useless keyborad is used as a toy for kids to teach alphabets and learning keyboard without computer.. Thanks.."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
4,The keyboard is good.The keys are soft to press.it has a big backspace.All the keys are working fine.The extra multimedia keya are really helpful for me.There are two cons of the product1.The side multimedia buttons are made of rubber which does not feel durable.2.The wire of keyboard is Really small.if u are going to use it for laptop then it is fine.if you are going to use it for desktop then the wire length could be a isseue.
1,Received used product. It seems product is not genuine Hp product.It happened with twice on Amazon to receive used second hand product.Very disappointed..Never recommended any one to buy from Amazon.
5,"I have got this product today in two day delivery and I paid Rs 80 as delivery charge. And also got some Cashback. Must go for it.Some amazing features like light weight, smooth buttons and convenient for typing purposes."
1,"Orininal c2500 wouldnt be like this, you can check with the original image on ad, and product delivered, the window logo on window key is the way you recognize the product original or copy. better another 200bucks and buy original. rather getting repaired with copy in 6months. and wires are too week, board is not too strong, ill break in one bend. keys will get loose soon..  worst."
1,If you are really looking for a key board for daily use buy HP-KU-1156 or equivalent. 6HD76AA model is waste of money in my opinion. Also better you buy keyboards directly form shops so that you will know what you are getting. Since there is no return on this item i am thinking of throwing it in dust bin.
4,"The keyboard & mouse set is of good build quality. It matched the online description. The keyboard has great tactile feedback and provides satisfaction while typing. The mouse has good response too, be it the scrolling or clicking, both feels prompt. The price may be a bit higher compared to other brands like Logitech, iBall or Zebronics, but that's just me, nitpicking. Overall the combo is a good deal I could get at ₹840/-."
5,"i brought for my ofc, its good for the price.Pros: soft, light weight, mouse is ful size and comfortable to hold, easy to clean design.Cons: letters should have been much more darker ( means more brighter white color font)....you can buy for normal use, not for gaming pls....."
1,"I got a really bad keyboard and mouse. The quality is so bad that the keyboard is not fully flat. It has a curve due to the extreme cheap plastic quality. I was to continue using it due to the urgency but then some of the keys wont work. I needed to press two times. Password wont work and did not know the issue. Horrible product. I returned and got a Logitech combo at same price and no words to compare. Very good build quality, finish and I am sure it will run for several years. May be this HP product is good but what I got is fake mostly."
1,Pros: Cheap. Simple with no gimmicksCons: The keys are very hard to press. Broke after 6 months some keys not working. Keyboard real model name K45Other Thoughts: To be honest this is the worst keyboard i have used till date. My old acer keyboard was so good it worked for 5+ years and the keys were also so soft. It's a cheapo crap in the name of HP. Avoid at all cost buy something else.
4,This set I had to get it replaced twice within warranty. I don't know why but  my Keyboard stopped working twice within the warranty period. This is the first time I am experiencing something from HP. Now it is working well and I hope it does so in the years to come. My previous keyboard (also HP lasted 7 years)
4,"Basic set of keyboard and mouse. I got this as my keyboard had stopped working . The keys are a bit noisy and lack the premium feel, as mentioned , this is a basic keyboard with mouse which will suit your basic surfing and office needs, won't be much useful for gaming or rigorous typing work."
3,"The mouse works fine, but the keyboard is made of cheap quality buttons that started getting stuck while typing. The main keys like the shift, space bar and the backspace are the ones that keeps ghosting often. You might want to consider getting another keyboard. Since, the combo was a value for money, I opted for this one. Not worth the problems."
4,"Good professional layout keyboard without any fancy keys. For normal typing, it works well. But, some lengthy keys like spacebar already make some horizontal movements. Need to see the reliability in the long run. HP used to make sturdy keyboards earlier that used to last forever. Going by current standards, it doesn't seem to be the case.Mouse is good. Not much complaints there."
2,"The mouse is very light, and, good to use.The keyboard, however, very low quality. The keys are hard. Have to hit and not touch. The cheaper iBall keyboard is better. Bought this because of a discount.  Cost was Rs 649. Gonna keep the mouse, but will buy iBall keyboard."
5,"If you are looking for simple wired keyboard and mouse for your daily office purposes, this product is perfect. The keys of the keyboard are very deep which gives a nice old-school sensation while typing. The mouse is also sturdy and smooth. I wish the keyboard was backlit so I could use it at night with the lights off. But despite that I would say that in the wired category this keyboard mouse pair is the best."
3,"I have ordered this HP C25000 keyboard &mouse combo on 21st Oct, 2020 at 8pm and received it on 23rd Oct, 2020 by 10:30 am(being a Prime subscriber). Isn't it a swift delivery, yes never had this fast delivery on any ecommerce site.Coming to product:Con's1. Yes it seems to be a copy of original HP C2500 one.2. The key board is small and keys are too short, I am a medium handed persona and I can't type fast using this small keys, if I press one key, it may type two letters. Not at all suggested for office work which have extensive keyboard usage.3. A couple of keys seems to be very loose like both Shift keys, and T and a couple more keys very loose.4. Many said there is not much key tap sound, but it makes considerable noise while typing.Pro's:1. Mouse is big enough and works perfectly awesome.2. Both keyboard and mouse seems to be strong enough to last more than an year.3. Lookwise, stunning. Perfectly designed and apeleaing in looks.4. Brand, but again for me it seems a copycat.Hope this review helps. Thanks."
5,"All over good.durability 1year minimum for gaming users..light weight around 200grams.No technical issue, Buttons are very attractive and sweatable in case of typing..you can definitely purchase this combo pack.it will be very beneficial to you."
1,"Hi,After getting this product the key was very smooth and so comfortable to use, but after some time key of the keyboard start becoming jams and now some of the keys also not working...same with mouse, scroll got jamsWill not prefer this product to anyone, if someone cares for their money then he/she should go for another option"
4,Likes :comfortablesleek design of keyboardBoth light weightDislike'Clikkkk' sound when you click on Mouse.you may hear little noise in keys when you press on keyoard.. but not that bad..I would still recommend to buy this as this looks decent and working as expected.
5,"I use this set with my HP laptop for Work-from-home situation. I have not been a fan of chiclet-keyboard of any non-Mac laptops. So, I wanted a low-cost external keyboard. Ordered this set and it works fine. Touch and feel of keys are good. Of course, that is maybe because I like old-school type of computer keyboards! Overall good experience. Bonus: This Mouse, I am even using it for my MacBook Pro. Mouse works 10 times better than the so called magic mouse from Apple. Lol!!"
4,Good Product. When i open the box. Space key in missing but its still in the box. i fix it by myself and its wprking properly. Very smooth keys. Mouse is also very comfortable.  functioning is proper. You can buy this . after all good product. I'm using this for typing ot gaming purpose.
4,If u r on a tight budget go for it. But if u can spend more than 3k there r better options including mechanical keyboards. Both the keyboard and the mouse have USB connector. Performance is satisfactory. For the Price its a good deal :)
3,"Super flexible, feels like a little more force can easily break it. Light though. Better than chiclet i.e. laptop-style keys as these are half-height. Certainly helps in gaming. Do feel a little mushy, and give that feeling like, oh, this is so obviously membrane, and certainly even the cheapest mechanical kb like those redgear/redragon/cosmic byte can beat it in terms of gaming and typing experience. For the price, though, can't really ask more. Spend a little more and do youself a favor, buy the redgear blaze 3."
3,Keyboard is super smooth. Awesome keys.  Mouse was ok for few days but  after 15 to 20 days of usage the middle mouse button stopped working.  Keyboard is very good and mouse is waste. Better buy Dell mouse.Better to buy keyboard individually than combo.
2,"I ordered it by mistake, very flimsy product..finishing is very bad...no special function keys...Mouse is also looking ugly and both are not a durable ones...Please consider a different one if you are planning for a long term usage guys..."
4,Video Player is loading.
1,"Keys feedback is hard and rough. You don’t get nice feedback when typing, always tend to recheck on the screen for what you have typed. Price is also not that cheap. For average users only. Not recommended for regular typing activity."
1,quality of the keyboard is really lower for a brand like HP. I DOUBT IF ITS ORIGINAL.you really need to press the keys harder for the data to be captured. please dont buy this product.
1,The keyboard is very bad. The keys aren't smooth. Spacebar is now behaving like a swing. Have to click in the middle only. A very bad quality product delivered. Doesn't feels like I am using a branded keyboard.
5,"I am learning to type and was looking for a keyboard of mid range, between 600 to 1000. This one serves the purpose beautifully. The keys, plastic feel and built quality of the mouse and the keyboard are very good and satisfactory. I am happy with the purchase. It's a genuine product. Don't hesitate and go for it if you want one for mostly typing and office work."
5,600Rs ka mila. Sabse achhi baat Mouse kya kam karta hai...rubber grip for scroll is the best thing.2. Size of the mouse is best no other mouse as it is.3. Senstitvity of mouse is fabulous.4. Light weight.5. Keys of keyboard is so smooth even after rough and tough condition.Over all great product
2,It is so noisy and flimsy. You will feel typewriter effect while using. Not for office use. Wasted money on this.I wanted to return but there is no such option.Bought another dell keyboard - kb216p. Very satisfied with that.
5,Using this keyboard I am writing this review. If you don't like to press buttons really hard and want to buttons to be fast n responsive then this is the best keyboard for the job. I am using this key board for 2-3 months give me plsr.
5,Nice product. Quality is good. And the keys are smooth of keyboard. And the mouse function is very smooth and clickable is very fast. I refer to others buy this product without any doubt or questions. And one the thing I am not tested for gaming or others to use this product. I using it in my HP Laptop for general uses.
1,Mouse doesn't navigate smoothly just in couple of weeks of use. The curosr gets stuck at one place and you need to lift and adjust the cursor. Did not expect such horrible quality from HP after paying a decent amount.
2,"The mouse is too small but working fine and clicks good and is very responsive. I didn't like the low quality keyboard which will bend when you press slightly. Not very responsive and doesn't feel like a decent quality keyboard. Zebronics keyboard was way better than this. don't buy seeing the ""hp"" branding. I am using the zebrronics keyboard now."
5,"I am using it for last 6 months WFH, the keyboard is very good, the buttons are nice and easy to type. The mouse is easy to use and works great. No complains.Bought from https://amzn.to/3l2h0EG , the service is fast."
4,Thought its a spring keyboard similar to TVS. But its a normal keyboard. Ok for the money spent as combo of mouse and keyboard costs same in the open market as have saved some money for travelling to the computer shop nearby
5,As I am writing review after 3-4 months it's  Working well the quality not enough but good purchase at this price. It is not a gaming keyboard but it's good for office work and students for programming. Loved the product go for it
5,Good quality product. It was having a good longevity and very much comfort to use it. I made this review after one month and my suggestion was that go for it.
5,Good prodect keys of keyboard are soft and mouse is excellentLoved it thanks Amazon 😗😗
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ₹350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren’t workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
1,"This was my first Amkette product and I was in a desperate need of a keyboard given the WFH scenario. I usually read a lot of reviews before going in for a purchase and to be honest I did do a bit a research on this purchase as well. However, given the urgency, I probably cut a few corners in my product research. And I am suffering the consequences of it.Coming to the problem at hand, the first key to give up was the Shift. Then, after a few days 9,6 and 3 on the numpad gave up. I am at a point now wherein I get gifts in the form of a new key giving up every day.Can you imagine the horror, for someone who works in the IT industry, of not having a properly functioning keyboard. I am throwing this one out the day my new keyboard arrives."
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
3,"I ordered this keyboard back in june 2019. Within a year my numerical keys above the alphabet keys stopped working. And recently the shift keys and some of the other special character keys have also stopped working. For the price it is worth it if you are in a pinch and need a new keyboard, like I did. But I would recommend against getting it as a gaming keyboard or hoping that with will last for years."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
3,"Overall good and functional but build quality is flimsy. The image is a bit misleading in terms of build quality. Not gamed yet, but all keys are working. Note that the ₹ key will work with English India pack only. Its pretty good if you tend to work or play in total darkness but don't have the budget for a good quality backlit board. The plastic used is so cheap and feeble that even normal typing bends the board."
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ₹300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard 😂. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
1,"If you really want low budget Keyboard please go for zebronics or quantum.. I would recommend Logitech or TVS if you dont have budget idea. As I have a PS/2 Logitech keyboard for 13 years till now working well.For budget dont go for Amkette...I bought it for 275 thinking i saved money a lot. But It stopped working after 1.5 year but i  used that very very rarely..Most of the time it was unplugged and idle and untouched..So i cannot claim warranty .So i opened the keyboard and i was shocked there is only a tiny low quality toy microcontroller chip which will easily stop working if we drop the toy..Just like that of you drop the keyboard , there is high chance that it will stop work .I have dropped the logitech literally so many times but still it is working good. The quality is so so poor that the real manufacturing value of the amkette keyboard will not exceed hundred ruppess... The chip , soldering is so low quality .and low standard... Dont buy this keyborad if it is beyond 250rs.. And dont buy this if you have chances of dropping it.. The usb voltage fluctuation if occurred might also affect the chip very easily.. Go for branded please... Now the useless keyborad is used as a toy for kids to teach alphabets and learning keyboard without computer.. Thanks.."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
4,The keyboard is good.The keys are soft to press.it has a big backspace.All the keys are working fine.The extra multimedia keya are really helpful for me.There are two cons of the product1.The side multimedia buttons are made of rubber which does not feel durable.2.The wire of keyboard is Really small.if u are going to use it for laptop then it is fine.if you are going to use it for desktop then the wire length could be a isseue.
5,Got this awesome keyboard at at a price of ₹299. Keyboard has good grip at bottom. Smooth keys. Good height adjustable stand. Recommending all to buy this keyboard.
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better.
4,"Product is good, exactly as shown in the images. But the only thing I am surprised with is Amazon is now selling items without a GST bill. So, neither have i received any GST invoice with the product nor it is available to download from the order page. This is weird being the fact is that the GST invoice is the warranty card for this. Amazon must look into this matter.Uodate:- The GST invoice was available for download after two days of delivery."
1,I made the mistake of buying 2 Keyboards believing in Brand HP! Huge mistake.It is the most TERRIBLE Product.The Keys get stuck. Some keys behave erratically on its own.My money is wasted. But do yourself a favour. And stay away.
3,"Bought it on 24 Feb 2020, and the keyboard overall is nice with addition of just the volume control and no unnecessary buttons. However within 2 months i have a malfunctioning key - the letter 'b' is typed only sometimes. My usage is not much, still it has malfunctioned so early. Return period was within 7 or 10 days - no i'm stuck with it now. Will need to buy some other new one soon."
4,Review after usage of 1 week:1.Simple minimalistic keyboard2.Good for typing3.I use this keyboard for coding and development works.No complaints till now.4.Connects to and disconnects from laptop within second.Smooth and fast connectivity.
4,"The product is very good for the price range but there are a few minor quirks that I would like to point out for a specific kind of buyer.1.  The typeface printed on the keys are quite thin. If you are moving from using other keyboards with a more visible letters on the keys than you will have some time adjusting to the new keyboard, especially under low light condition.2. The body has mild flex in the mid section, although it is much better than the one you would find in Logitech K120.3. The keys are quite soft and silent, easy on the fingers, but lacks that tactile feedback you would normally find in other keyboards from bran such as Lenovo."
5,"There's nothing to take away from this guy. I am using it with macos and the scroll lock, pause, home keys are automatically used for some mac shortcuts. F11 takes you to desktop. And the dedicated sound buttons are just life savers. The build at places is a little too glossy for me, but overall it's been an absolutely perfect purchase.P.S. Typing noob so can't compare with typing experience. Gaming noob so... You get it! Just an average keyer who liked what he got!"
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient."
4,"If anyone thinks that it is the same keyboard as one gets with the HP PCs or AIOs then you are wrong. I typing this review with the above keyboard itself. The keys are nice and travel is as usual. But, when one compares with the keyboards provided with the HP PCs and AIOs, then it is not that sturdy and heavy. The keys are very soft and free as it is a new one and i am pretty sure it is not a heavy duty one. It is not heavy and strong. OK product. The quality wise it is giving me the same feeling which i have with frontech or intex cheap keyboard. For office uses it is a sure NO and for home [WFH] purpose it is ok. Will update more as the time goes with it using."
4,"What's important for keyboard is to make a consistent key layout. Many manufacturers these days ignore such fundamental design principles, and this keyboard is no exception. I chose this keyboard for avoiding a specific odd placement of inverted 'Enter' key. This keyboard has a straightforward Enter key, but oh boy. The PrintScr/Scroll Lock/Pause-Break buttons are lifted off from their original row of function keys, down one step. This is done to accommodate a ridiculous set of volume control buttons which rarely anyone uses. This further pushed the Insert/Home/Page Up keys one row down.Now, I need to get adjusted to this new odd behavior. Every now and then I screenshot my desktop, when I've to 'Insert' something. Nothing happens when I think I'm banging on Page Up (but Pause/Break is at that position).Do these multimedia gimmicks on maybe so called flashy multimedia keyboards please, spare the professional versions."
1,Some keys are inoperative. Didn't expect this from hp brand. Very disappointed! There's no option for return. Only replacement.. have requested for replacement. Will update the review after receiving the new keyboard.
2,Better look for any other alternative brand since HP is neither offering options such as entry level priced keyboard and premium one nor willing to improve despite of many people giving feedback about hard keys.  Such arrogance is not permitted in today's time when there is no dearth of options.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"I choose this keyboard and it was perfect for what I needed... Typing feels good and crisp, product quality is decent as well...It works great..highly recommended..*I don't play games on this keyboard,so I don't know if it would be good for gaming or not.."
3,"Cheap price and quality. This was only branded cheaper option for wired keyboards. Works perfectly fine. Keys dont get stuck while typing.Quality of plastic is average and the keyboard raiser at the back are extremely flimsy. One broke after 3 months.Most of the other wireless keyboards are way costlier than this, so this gets the job done."
2,I bought this in Feb of 2021 and it worked erfectly (key not working) for a month or so and then started showing wear and tear. Many keys on the keyboard don't work anymore. This is the kind of roducts we are getting nowadays. They hardly last a few months.
1,Purchased in June 2020 and and the space bar is not working (first week of Sep). Did not last even 3 months.  Tried to fix the membrane by opening the key. Did not help. VERY POOR QUALITY. HP website does not even recognize the product (tried with Product number and Serial number)
5,"I was so tired while searching for keyboard for my 17”laptop,  finally I went with simple thought to try this keyboard and surprisingly it is compact and well suited for my laptop.And I highly recommend as it is simple and cost effective."
5,"I ordered this for work from home, this is similar to the keyboard that I used at office. Works as expected, characters are clearly visible and decent click action. It has no back light and not recommended for gaming. Overall  it is worthy for work from home."
1,"Very bad..hardly used to for two weeks and almost all the keys have become hard.  I want to return but return period is over . I would definitely suggest people not to buy this. Waste of money. Was using Logitech for 4 years, no issues.  This keyboard lasted hardly two weeks.. a big no if you ask me."
5,"I needed a keyboard for the purpose of typing so I picked this keyboard. The design and quality is delectable. It has got volume keys. Feels strong and sturdy, smooth to type. My papa made a blue cloth cover for the keyboard to avoid the dust issue."
1,.....this away in a week as I spilt some beer on this by accident. I shook off all the moisture and dried it for hours in the sun for four or five days before discarding it. Buy spill- proof keyboards.
1,For this price range we can buy a non-branded keyboard which can compete the quality of this keyboard. Keys are not premium for this price range. Even though the grip is fine the keys are very wobbly. I'm a keyboard enthusiast and a fan of HP. My expectations for this keyboard is very minimal according to this price range but HP failed to give a quality product which deserved for this money! :( going to buy another keyboard now... what a waste of money!
4,"The keyboard is decent for its price. I had a Lenovo keyboard which was terrible to type with. The keys are very sticky and difficult to type with. However the HP keyboard is far better. For those who are looking for a keyboard for office kind of work, with low budget, I would recommend this.I cannot comment on the longevity of the product at this stage."
3,The product is good. I opened the box two days after receiving it as I did not have have time and was going out of town when it arrived. Once I opened it two days later I found the USB connecter in bad shape. It was pinched. I was tired after my trip and since it was already two days. I tried to correct the shape of that metal housing of the connector and still using it like that with usb hub. I don't want the post on my laptop to get damaged cause of it. I suggest check the product first for damages upon arrival
5,It works smoothly. I haven't faced any problems with it so far. The keys are smooth and with the right pressure. They are neither hard nor soft. Only a light touch is needed to make it work.
1,It is China Product....Someone put comment that it is an Indian and I bought it
2,"The product got delivered on 27th October 2020. The HP USB Keyboard does not get ""recognized"" by my laptop. I also bought an HP USB Mouse along with it and the mouse works perfectly fine. All my other USB cords, Pen drives also work well.I tried troubleshooting and other methods. It worked for one day, but the next day onwards the same problem reoccured and it still persists.I tried connecting the keyboard using all of USB ports on my laptop but it failed anyway.It would be great if I can exchange, if not return, the product.Thank you."
3,The keys are very clunky so not useful for gaming at all or even fast typing. Build quality is okay. Good enough for normal users.
3,The space key was defective (see pic) when I received.Have ordered replacement as there is no return.Also the height adjuster has only 2 settings. It cant go further which is drawback. I wanted to raise the keyboard higher.Keys are ok but a bit smaller than on my lenovo laptop. If you have big hands dont buy this please.
3,"Bought it for my work desk setup.PROS:-The keyboard looks premium and build feels good.-Keys are soft to touch and the response is quick as well.-The key travel is also good.CONS:-The edges of the keys are too sharp and was a bit comfortable while we land our fingers on the edges.-For a mac user, the keys felt small, so we tend to press on wrong keysIf you are comfortable with keys being a bit small and want to have mechanical keyboard type feel with less or no noice then you can consider buying this."
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
5,"The product is very light in weight. All keys are very smooth and makes typing easy.I am using it in both my desktop computer and laptop computer. When I received this keyboard I was surprised to see it's good material and nice looking.The keyboard has three hot keys and usb pin for connecting to pc.hot keys are volume up, volume down and mute volume. Keyboard also works with otg supported Android phone.I have tested it with yureka plus(Android 10)."
4,Yup Value for money good. Writing this review after 2 months of purchase .Some times i feel the keys are a but far like the H key is a bit hard to reach and i type g a lot not sure if my problem or the keyboards.. But overal the keyboards syill fine and kicking  .Go for it .
5,Brought this product and have been using it for a month now. Very happy with it. The keys and the ergonomics and the usability is really good and worth the money. The delivery was also super quick. I would say that this keyboard is perfectly suited for hard and soft typers alike. The wire length is also good and overall I am really happy with the product.
4,I bought this for INR 616 since my old keyboard had stopped working. I am satisfied with it and seems to be ok. All keys are working and the keyboard has decent ergonomics
5,"This is very easy to type and properly spaces keyboard with good response from keys. Great to type on, great for office use. Good for gaming too"
4,"Its a plastic so it's very light but the longevity is something that can be... low, for me, so far, it's been good.Yes it is mechanical keyboard, but don't expect the clicky noise to be what you want, it's plastic body so... it sounds okay.For it's price range, it's really good. Even though it's Plastic, it doesn't feel like it will break very soon.Its an okay product.Gaming-  sorry I don't game on pc so I don't know..."
3,"It's OK, but expected more better plastic quality. The keys are a bit bouncy and find it but difficult to type quickly. Ok for average use but for more professional daily use I would prefer mechanical than membrane keyboard."
1,The product looks genuine but a group of keys are not functioning!Customer care number provided by Amazon customer care is also not correct
5,"I was using CM Storm combo for over two years until few of its keys gave up.Cosair K55 is my second gaming keyboard. I considered all the best options for this price range- logitech G213 Logitech G413 or Razer Cynosa Chroma. The much harder choice was to decide weather to got for a membrane keyboard or a mechanical one. Mechanical keyboard.I shortlisted Logitech G413 mechanical which is 1k more expensive and K55.G413 is mechanical accompanied with a USB pass through and K55 on the other hand have 6 Anti Ghost keys and its RGB more aesthetically pleasing. G413 have  Roomer-GTM mechanical switch which are not as strong as cherry mx switches. So here I am with a Corsair K55 RGB.Pros:1. Nice Aesthetically pleasing RGB that appears around the keys (unlike G213 that have RGB on the letters of keys).2. Build quality is good.3. The custom keys are a bonus for gamers. I am a grown up adult who play games on steam occasionally.4. No need of any software for the RGB effect.Cons:1. This keyboard is not mechanical.2. The custom keys are a bit of pain , I mistook G1 for Escape and G6 for Ctrl Key."
3,"This keyboard is for the guy that does not want to or cannot afford a mechanical keyboard. Its got great tactile feeling for being a non-mechanical keyboard and the RGB and the palm rest definitely help. Its got good anti ghosting and macro keys for those high intensity moments as well. Don't really care about media controls but they're there if you want them. And they can work. But why am I taking out 2 stars then if its all good?The piece I got shipped came with a firmware issue that conflicted with my other drivers. Primarily, sound. Its LEDs kept malfunctioning too. Corsair's software (similar to Logitech's Gaming Software and Razer's Synapse) is poorly optimized and somewhat resource hungry. It has a lot of fluff for what it is trying to do. When I tried to RMA it, the company it was partnered up with, could not collect the device from my home, which was a pain since it was on the other side of the city in which I live and I am suffering from a leg issue that makes going around hard for me. But, I would like to give Corsair the benefit of the doubt and say that this was a singular event. Also, it doesn't say it is waterproof anywhere. So be careful when drinking around this thing. The cable is not braided either.tl;dr:==Pros==> RGB Backlighting> Good tactile feel> Macro keys> Palmrest> Anti Ghosting==Cons==> Can come with firmware and/or LED issues> Not waterproof (from what I know)> iCUE is mediocre at best> Non braided cable"
5,"prety good for membrane keyboard and budget friendly at the same time if rgb is your thing too. I got dust entering the keyboard through and that shows when the rgb lighting is used so cleaning will be a drag.....also this is not mechanical keyboard so only go for this if you are on budget or want to replace within 2 years(can be used longer but mechanical is better for long term use as it causes less stress on the fingers. but when it comes to membrane keyboards you can just go for this , its durable , looks good and works great."
4,"Well the product should not be sold by corsair .Why i am saying this?! Look below i explain big issues then small issues.1) the extra 4 macro keys.They are useful for editors but not for gamers .I keep hitting them instead of Esc and Shift key .A fix is to remap them via micro as the key u want to press but still i keep hitting wrong keys because of big side of keyboard and macro keys.Results in losing game in clutch moments.2) Key pressing feel is not so good.My old logitech keyboard which costs like 850 rupees now is better than this.I can know which key is pressed .3) RGB is a waste for keyboard like this.3 zone and they still doesn't feel very good because thee light comes below the keys ,too.it distracts so much in night .I had to put it at minimum level but then it's no use.4) My biggest problem is the Num lock and Caps lock notification led's are keeps malfunctioning .It doesn't light up at all after 5 minutes of plugging in keyboard.Soft reset and formware repload doesn't fix it.I have to unplug and replug it.5) It's too big .After i month i bought GIGABYTE MECHANICAL FORCE K83 without RGB for 3200 from MD computers because on amazon it's too costly.and it's better than this crap that i can't use at all.Money well wasted.If you are a pure gamer get TKL keyboards which are great for or any mechanical keyboard .Go for branded one uthough.Chinese bramds are giving chinese switches and keycaps."
3,Amazing keyboard and the RGB effect is really good thanks to surrounded membrane around the keys. The brightness is good as well. It is not per key RGB but static colors or rainbow effect is really good.Literally 13 macro keys which make it very good for multimedia usage. Macro keys if configured well can be an added bonus for your work.Downside?- (As per my hand structure) the keycaps are smaller than usual so typing experience is not good. My hand usually pains after 1hr of typing.- Left side Macro keys are heaven for missing out of escape and hands position. But it's very useful.- Self polish effect where the keys start shining after a while. You can take it as a feature or a con.

4,"The typing on this keyboard feels nice; the key travel is slightly higher than what I expected of a typical Membrance keyboard. It is very pricey; I feel that something of this keyboard technology should be about 2000 or less. The lighting is very nice, it is a 3 zone RGB, and you can program all the zones separately.The 6 extra programmable keys are a nice addition. You can also program any other key on the keyboard using the ICUE software that corsair provides. The media buttons are also sufficient and are a welcome addition to this product. I have been using it for about 14 days and playing competitive games such as Apex legends, and it is appropriate. The wrist rest is such a wonderful thing, and the best part is that it's detachable. There is one small problem; you might get confused if you are coming from a small keyboard, your hand might get confused sometimes and press the G6 key instead of the CTRL-key."
5,"Its a membrane dome not mechanical and at this price point it is absolutely fair. I have used mechanical in past and obviously I see the difference in gaming in terms of response. But being membrane these are very silent . The RGB is not very bright because of the diffused membrane layer so keep that it mind if you are looking for rainbow puke shining in your eyes. other wise I liked the options of 6 programmable keys , although I mainly bought this for the inbuilt wrist rest and dedicated media keys. Also it does not require any kind of software installation to work although if you want it to be controlled via Corsair iCUE , its an option as well."
4,"The keyboard is reliable, looks fantastic, and has useful media keys. Corsair is a trustworthy brand and for this price this is a great buy.Logitech has a direct competitor to this, and it's the same value. It's up to preference. I bought this because of the detachable palm rest, but honestly it doesn't make a difference. I also never ended up using the macro keys.The only other option is cheap mechanical keyboards from Chinese companies. I love using them but they're unreliable, my Redragon stopped working after nearly a year.I don't like the bloated software icue. I'm tired of everything having it's own unwieldy dedicated software. But I appreciate the customization.It's a great keyboard for budget gamers. It's great for typing too. It's too flashy to be used at work, but it's a good buy for a midrange setup."
5,"To me, productivity is the key, not the RGB lighting.In this keyboard, there are only 3 region of RGB lighting that can be set (I mostly keep simple white color background)But here are the best parts about this keyboard.Pros:1. Per key macro: You can map individual key to macro; If you need there are additional 6 more keys for macro2. Profile changes automatically as I switch between applications3. Super easy to use software to record & / assign macro (macro does not record mouse's relative position (like in Razer software), but records mouse movement with absolute click position );4. Software switch profile so so quickly; zero lag5. You can copy macro to global library and from there to any other application6. Gives a good feeling while typing (like mechanical keyboard)7. RGB color brightness can be changedCons:1. No individual RGB lighting2. Light leak between key gaps (unlike in Logitech G213)"
5,"Even though it's not mechanical. It's a brilliant bang for buck keyboard in its range compared to other brands like Razer etc. You'd be surprised how long this keyboard will last you. A friend of mine have been using this for almost 2 years without any hitch for all sorts of studio/ gaming purposes.All in all, I'm hoping to get the same benefits."

2,"I was mesmerised by the great brand and reasonable price, along with the pretty photographs. Alas! I was mistaken. I will summarise the issues I had…- The keys are small and not properly spaced out. You inevitably end up getting frustrated while typing.- Keys are harder to press (it’s a membrane keyboard) and not at all comfortable for long typing sessions. The fingers and wrist  start getting tired pretty quickly.- When looked at closely and in complete darkness, I noticed that the RGB keeps flickering for some inexplicable reason. I found it quite annoying and disappointed.- I am not at all a gamer so I have no views on it’s gaming capabilities or usefulness.Overall, I was quite disappointed with the keyboard and returned it after noticing all these issues. As always, Amazon has been wonderful throughout this process."
3,"pros - silent , waterproof , good RGB feeling , plam rest pad , extra customizable buttons , plug and play , solid build. good for casual gamer or casual use keyboard.cons - for 3k-4k not worth it as u can get good mechanical keyboard in this price range, seriously not for competitive gamers , keyboard is too big , only few option for RGB kind of look Lightning ( it is not RGB )."
5,"• Got this for Rs. 3299/- during the sale.• Best mechanical keyboard in this price range.• Keys are so smooth and perfectly placed for all purposes (extreme typing, gaming).• Wrist-rest pad makes is more comfortable.• RBG lighting is great. There are various effects and 3 brightness levels available too.• Macro buttons makes the job a lot easier if you're an artist/gamer. Like macros in mouse are good but sometimes they aren't sufficient, so the keys in this keyboard helps a lot."

5,"Bought this at sale INR 3299. I must say best membrane gaming keyboard at this price. Key strokes have good feedback. RGB lighting is there. Media keys , volume control keys are there. 6 Programmable separate buttons are there. Plus textured palm grip. Yeah its not mechanical keyboard, but i would say if you don't have budget for mechanical gaming keyboard then this is the best next option."
5,I have been using this product for almost a year now.ProsExcellent customisationErgonomicSilentGood key travel and feedbackConsNot perkey RGBOil and Dirt MagnetRequires software to run macros
4,"Excellent for a rubber-dome keyboard. Handy ergonomics. Convenient multimedia keys. Every part of this keyboard cites a premium price point. It's not the cheapest in its segment, but it does give you value for money.Macro keys could be better designed, preferably at a level below or a level above the rest of the keys. As it is, it takes some getting used to, to not press the G4, G5 and G6 keys when trying to press capslock, shift and control.A major plus-point for me were the removable keycaps, which makes cleaning as easy as a mechanical board, if not easier.Overall: Another great buy for Corsair. No long-term regrets.(P.S: the dust on the keyboard in the image is because of a month of use. It arrived in pristine condition.)"

4,This keyboard is awesome for its price. I was confused  btw logitech g213 and this one. It has some pros and consPros:-1. It is full RGB2. There is no need of software3. It has a windows lock which I needed so much4. It has a detachable palm rest unlike logitech g2135. The keys have a nice response time and are tactile6. It has all the multimedia keys which I needCons:-1. The RGB could be better when you look at it from the side the RGB seems a little dull but when you look at it from above its awesome.2. It's not a mechanical keyboard3. This is a con I guess for me but I don't know how to clean the keyboard so if you dont either then 1st get to know how to clean it and then buy itI have been using it for more then 2 weeks and I am happy with it so I will recommend for you to buy it. Now dont think that it's not a mechanical keyboard. With these many fractures in this price you can't give it mechanical keys.BTW  I AM NOT USED TO TYPE ON PHONE THATS WHY THERE WILL BE ERRORS
5,I m a gamer and it's v good RGB lights working perfectly keys are good perfect key board in this price
5,I am a 3d visualizer and have been using those cheap Logitech keyboards for a long time.  I always thought why to go for costlier ones. All fulfill the same purpose right?? But I was wrong. It makes a lot of difference with these high-quality keyboards.  The keys are membrane so the response is amazing. The backlight looks and feels awesome. The macro recording keys are a blessing. A must buy for any designer.!!
5,"I bought this keyboard after using a few cheap mechanical ones. The Blue mechanical switches with the clicky sound are not for me. So if you're looking for a quiet keyboard this one is a great option. It's gonna take some time getting used to a membrane keyboard if you're switching from a cheap mechanical one but it's worth it.PROS -1. Great RGB Lightings - The keyboard is divided into 3 zones and u can change each zone's color according to your liking or you can choose from 2 effects.2. You get 6 Macro keys for recording stuff, this is something even some 5-6k keyboards don't have.3. Dedicated Multimedia keys, you don't have to press Fn and then another key to activate them.4. There is a rubberized wrist rest which is great if you have to work for long hours. (I personally don't use it but it's nice that they have provided with an option)CONS-1. The biggest con for me for this keyboard is the placement of the macro keys. They are on the extreme left of the keyboard. So I accidentally have pressed G6 when I wanted to press control and so on. It's gonna take some time to get used to this layout.2. The height adjustment stand provided is really useless you don't get much elevation. I personally can't even notice the different."
5,"I am planning to buy corsair high end mechanical Red or Brown for quite long (almost 2 years). Because of the price tag, I thought of going with this model.The keyboard is so smooth and silent. The feel can be a bit more better.Once started working in it, so smooth and pleasant experience in typing. I am going to use mainly for programming. I would recommend anyone anyday  this brand.The ergonomic aspect  of the keyboard shows , how much they put in the effort.Highly recommended,  for coding"
4,"If you want to get a better idea of the Pros of this keyboard, there's no better place than YouTube right now.I will just talk about the only Con that is worth telling since I have noticed people don't really mention this- You can customize the RGB lighting of the keyboard with combo keys of ""Fn""+(1,2,3...= and F1, F2, F3). The main problem with this is you can't use these combos if you have Corsair Utility Engine running in the background(and you need this running if you want your macros and other remaps for the keyboard to work. You are pretty much doomed if you are also using a Corsair MMO mouse as well) Almost replaced the keyboard thinking my ""Fn"" key was faulty.So basically you either don't run iCUE at all and get full control of the RGB customizations with your keyboard OR you sacrifice the on demand RGB customization so that you can use macros and other utilities in the software and settle for a default color scheme.This might be a bit subjective but I think Corsair could've done a better job at this."
4,"Me more adapted to chicklet keyboard, it took time to get used to.I wish i could set to all white backlit, but it doesn't have one :(.Does the job.. only a few months usage so far."
4,"This is a very good keyboard at this price range from Corsair. I've played many games like Assassin's creed odyssey, Battlefield V, The Division 2, Shadow of the tomb raider, Far Cry 5, GTA V and the experience is good. Keyboard looks amazing and has 3 illumination modes. Windows lock button adds functionality while gaming.  Hardcore gamer's can choose better mechanical keyboards. Kudos to team Amazon and seller for timely delivery and fine packaging."
5,"SUPERB KEYBOARD.SOMEWHAT FEELS LIKE MECHANICAL,BUT NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD. RGB IS AMAZING AND SOUL OF THIS KEYBOARD. BUT I STILL THINK THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE BRIGHTNESS. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH. I AM IN SO MUCH LOVE WITH THIS KEYBOARD. IF YOU DON'T WANT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD,RGB IS YOUR MAIN CONCERN AND YOU ARE ON A BUDGET,THEN THIS IS YOUR BUDDY.JUST GO AND GET IT."
5,"This is one of the best keyboards out there for this price. The keys have matte finish which feels damn good. Moreover the keypress sounds are crisp and a bit less noisy than mechanical keyboards ( the tactile feel is best, given that its a membrane keyboard ) . Detachable wrist rest adds another star to it. Wrist rest also has matte finish which some buyers are not liking for not being rubber even though it feels perfectly smooth. Extra buttons and multimedia controls are responsive and work very well. RGB lighting is awesome. It can be changed via keyboard itself or iCUE software from corsair. Another major feature i loved was the keyboard contour. The key rows are arranged slightly down in the middle of keyboard and slightly up on top and bottom edges and provides perfect erogonomic comfort while typing. Even better reason to love it is that with time you get used to the height of various rows and helps you type without looking at the keyboard more easily and with less mistakes.Overall its the best choice for given price for the features it has!  10/10 :)"
2,This is a total waste of money if you are going for high intensity and micro second time response gaming like CS or Dota or similar. It is no different than other brands in the price range of Rs.1000-Rs.1500 and there is no antighosting. I tried clicking 2 keys in milisecond response and it never happens and sometimes normal key in the game doesn't work either.I am highly dissatisfied for the quality I got for such poor performance gaming. Big name but really little it does.
1,"Tried everything.Updated everything.Apparently, some software problem which leads to disconnections arbitrarily.""USB not recognized"" pops up when you try reconnecting.In fact, I have always taken very good care of it and yet, the problem occurs.Wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a durable product."
5,"Pros:-Nice keys/keystrokes-Cool backlit keys + easy tuning.-Macros + media controls.-Build qualityCons-It's huge, takes up half of my desk space.-Corsair's iCUE s/w crashes on my laptop. (more to do with software than the keyboard itself)"
3,"All-around 3 stars. The keyboard is decent, RGB is not what it looks like. Once dirt and dust settle under the keys you can't do anything but blow air through the gaps which won't clean the under-keys area. It became hard to press a key after dust got deposited under it *sometimes I had to wiggle the key to properly press*.The RGB zones are fixed and if you slow down the lighting you will see the effects are not smooth at all.Overall a fine keyboard with great features like macro keys, hotkeys, RGB but not long-lasting."
2,"The  keyboard quality is great at this budget point. The lighting features  are also good. Keyboard feels  sturdy, though slightly heavy. For gaming,  this is perfect  as you wouldn't notice much the lettering on the keys. But there are  certain aspects that annoy me a lot.1. The printing on the numbers are too bad and you  won't be even able to read them without turning the backlight on.2. The lighting of the NUM, Caps and Windows  lock keys are way too bright that it hurts the eyes3. The  biggest concern till now is double spacing. While writing this review itself, I was able  to get 10+ errors for double  spacing, still  you cannot do anything  about it. That's very irritating. I am not even going to edit those spaces so that you can see the result yourself.I would recommend  to spend some extra bucks for  a better gaming keyboard. I'm stuck  with this for now.,"
5,"It's a decent keyboard with some good premium features. The build quality is quite good. considering it's low price, i was actually surprised seeing the build quality.Raised keys will give you mechanical keyboard like feeling.However it's a normal membrane keyboard.The LED's are very good ,it's bright but at the same time doesn't hurt your eyes. This keyboard can give  you a premium keyboard's look and feel.It doesn't look cheap at all like other competitors in the same price range.To be honest i didn't find any cons.However i would like to mention the following points if you considering to purchase it1) People are saying in the reviews that Printing on keys is not visible.Well it's true, but there's a reason behind it. Those letter inscriptions are actually transparent so that the backlit LED's can be easily visible. So keep in mind that you need to turn on the LED's all time in order to use this keyboard.Otherwise you'll face difficulties seeing the letters.But in my personal opinion nobody looks at the keyboard while typing as soon as they get used to with a particular keyboard.So, its not a con for me.2) Num Lock indicator ,Caps lock indicator and windows lock indicator LED's are too bright(blue color and you cannot change the LED color for these 3 LED indicators) and really hurts your eyes  because they  are pointing directly at your face. This can be very irritating at night time.3)Instead of violet ,they could go for Green LEDs for the 3rd color option.It would have been great.Now coming the the seller's service and delivery. I have no complain about the delivery time, but the packaging was worst.I purchased it from a seller named Appario Retail Private Ltd .They sent the product without any protection at all, no cardboard box ,no bubble wrap... nothing !! Not even a plastic wrap. They literally send the keyboard directly in it's product box without any packaging.Due to this horrible packaging (if you call it a packaging ) one corner of the keyboard got slightly damaged.The paint came off from the metal and also there were some minor scratches(See screenshot). Fortunately the internals of the keyboard didn't get damaged and working fine. I request the seller to please give importance to packaging.I know it's a very low budget keyboard,still protection should be given during shipping so that it doesn't get damaged.Apart from this packaging issue the product was genuine and the delivery time was quite good.I'm happy with amazons Service."
3,"While the keyboard quality is very good and sturdy, the printing on the keys is not very good. The print has already started peeling off on some keys."
4,"Received the product within 24 hours of ordering. There was absolutely no protective packing other than the original carton box. I have received smaller unbreakable products with heavier packing, but this was the other extreme. The carton box did not have any original seal (probably had been broken), the box had been sealed with amazon BOPP tape, there was no manual or any other leaflet inside. The black painting on the external metal body had faint scratches at two places. I am convinced that the product was probably opened and resealed before delivery, though the product looked new. Docking a star for poor packing and handling.The product is good functionally. With three colours to toggle and brightness to control, it gives user options to choose. This review has been typed using this keyboard. It has a soft squishy touch feeling, noise levels are a little more than my earlier Logitech USB keyboard. All the keys have been raised from the body, my only worry is that dust can easily settle below the keyboards and cleaning its would be a big task.  Yet to see this, maybe after some usage. I did read in some of the other reviews that the space bar did pose some problem, I do not have any double spaces being recognised when I use the space bar. Functionally there are no problems. Hence retaining the product though I had initially thought of returning it looking at the poor (rather none) packing and open seal delivery.The keyboard is pretty heavy and sturdy, quite easy to type with the raised position. Overall its value for money."
4,"Bought on 14th Aug, 2018. Been using everyday ever since. Price is still justified for what it brings.Pros- Nice, braided cable.- Comfortable to use even in long sessions. Height adjustable.- Durable. Keeys seem mechanical but they are not.- Multiple LED color options. Backlit with 3 LEDs.- No key ghosting experienced so far.Cons- If LED is turned off, you can almost not see any key letters.- Gathers dust a lot compared to normal keyboard due to metal body and static due to LED lights. Keep it coveredafter use.- No hand rest.- Lacks multimedia keys, you will have to use the Function key combinations for them.- Keys become loose and make squeaking sounds after a while.- Heightened keys to make space for backlighting may feel awkward at first and may take some time to get used to.- More LED options would have been great. The Num lock and Caps buttons have fixed Blue LEDs.- Body is metallic, so improper earthing/cable could feel the keyboard have static feel. Dont use with wet hands."
1,"From the day first, I have been facing the issue of disconnection.I have tried on two different Windows Gaming PC and having same issue ongoing.I also investigated that it is not the issue from cable, or from the connector.its the issue from internal circuits, as when it disconnects it shows error in Windows Device Manager, mentioning that device descriptor request failed and windows could not recognise the USB device.But when again after removing the USB connector and connecting again it works again and disconnects randomly again.Also, the RedGear website has nothing related to the warranty. In fact there is no website of RedGear."
4,"Bought for multimedia works but not for gaming.Overall, this is a good product from the red gear brand for this price rangeRight now im satisfied but I’m ready to buy again if the redgear releases the next version of this keyboard by clearing all of the mentioned cons below.Pros- Solid build & Aluminium material- Premium looks- Clear letter visibility even the keys are not individually lit.- Works also with Apple Mac Pro workstation- Easy to change the colors and brightness - More colors in the blaze 7 version keyboardCons- Letters are not visible even in the room lightso always LED lights on the keyboard must be turned on to use this keyboard- No dedicated multimedia keys- Keystroke sounds are high- Need more height adjustment function- More led light is wasted under the keys bcoz of floating keys design(I think gamers won’t consider this point as a drawback)"
2,After the damaged one I received Amazon replaced me with another keyboard in a day but I didn't like the Key Board because of its usability. It is backlit but colours provided are not two vibrant to work with and the worst part is the readability of the keyboard even with backlit on especially the special characters on the Keyboard is bad as the transparency Levels are bad. You cannot work with it with backlit off even in broad daylight due to the poor readability of keys.Space between Keys is very less and often you press two keys together or the wrong key on the same account. Function Keys are also not performing as you might think again due to lack of readability and poor function assigned. I would say it is an expensive gimmick than a practical keyboard.
1,"I am using this Keyboard for about 5 months now. And after 5 months when I type, it types something else. When I press space it open up calculator. Looks like this keyboard has become faulty. Not sure if I can get a replacement.But giving a 1star now Becaue the Keyboard is not working well after 5 months, looks like monsoon moisture."
5,"I  am a SW Professional and wanted a backlit keyboard, I do play games as well sometimes. This product is simply amazing; the overall Mechanical feel when you type. There is one issue with spacebar key that i have encountered is sometimes it skips press and sometimes instead of 1 space it puts 2.. i had the keyboard replaced but same issue in the new keyboard as well(Dont know if they gave a new one or handed the same one in new packing). I do face this issue 1 out of 50(approx) keypress.Below are some Suggestion based on my use of the product and which I feel can increase User Experience:-1. Redgear can maybe launch another keyboar for non-Gamers keeping a small Enter key and shifting '|' key above it rather than beside the enter key. As for programmers evey key position matters.2. Volume control keys can be shifted to F9-F12 as it would be easy to control volume with single hand combined with FN key. As right now it is at F2-F4 and needs two hands esp to reduce the volume due to large gap between F2 and FN key.Overall it has proven to be a very good keyboard and one can consider it against Mechanical one if they are on budget."
5,"in the price range of this, I think it's the best keyboard for the gamer and also for a normal user the keys are gives mechanical feedback and also it has 3 different light with four different layouts. The main thing is that is has a good branded cable and the quality is superb."
4,"1. right off the bat its amazing value for money. a fully backlit keyboard which has surprising key travel with 3 different colors with varying degree of brightness. quite a mouthful2. i bought this keyboard because some of the keys on my laptop were not working properly. this is working perfectly for me.3. we get a durable braided cable with this keyboard. which is always a good thing.4. the body is aluminum which honestly surprised me. its got a certain amount of weight to it. which speaks about its quality.5. however, there are a couple of drawbacks. the bigger keys are very wobbly. like the space bar, the shift key, the enter key, even the tab key. they're all way more wobbly for comfort.6. the biggest drawback is the caps lock number lock and scroll lock indicator keys are BLINDING!they literally are blinding. they are very very very bright. i cover it up with painters tape and it still manages to grab my attention when they're on.7. the backlit is amazing tho. you get 3 colors. red, blue, and sort of like purple. red is the least distracting and works for me in its least brightness setting. when you turn off the backlight, the keyboard becomes stealthy as hell. your keys become ""invisible"". for the pros8. each color has 3 varying levels of brightness. which is always a welcome feature. people who looked at the keyboard were properly impressed. some brownie points thereoverall a very good product. would 100% recommend it for gaming non gaming computer using people."
4,"The product is really good as per the budget.Pros :1. Mainly the backlit is good with the keys.2. The build quality is much better than other simple keyboards.3. The mechanical feel gives a nice touch to it. (But it's not a mechanical keyboard and not even the sound)Cons :1. If the indicators light will be colour changeable with the backlit and the brightness balanced with the backlit, then it'ld be awesome.2. I don't know if it's about the product or just a manufacturing defect. But, the one I get, having a little standing issue. as it's not balanced on a flat surface like table. One corner is not touching the table properly... So, I have to use a cheap under a corner to balance it properly.That's all.If you wanna buy a sturdy, backlit, stylish keyboard for gaming and night time usage (in dark room) with a budget that suits your pocket. Then u must go for this.Thanks to Amazon for the product."
1,"Pros:It has good backlit and keys are also feel like mechanical, USB cable and connector is also of good qualityCons:You cannot use it without switching on the backlit because keys become invisible as shown in photoIssue:I purchased this keyboard for work from home amid covid lockdown on 24th of May 2020. After 20-25 days of use I have started getting issue that if I press a key (once) it keeps typing same letter for 10-15 times. For an instance if I am typing ""I have an issue"" it become ""I have an isssssssssssssse"" frequency of this issue is approx once in 100 words but become more problematic when it happens with backspace keyIt has no support at all, amazon has provided an email address where I have been sending emails and reminders for last 10 days but not luck.So you can go for it, if you guys are lucky enough and do not need any customer support."
2,"It is so cheap doesn't even worth the money.I bought it on a lightning deal for Rs 949. Now I'm thinking just spend a little bit extra and get Antec MK3000 mechanical keyboard.Anyways I'm stuck with this one.After 5 days of using (3) on the numpad is just double spacing.When I press 3 once it register like 33 that's a major issue for me while gaming.Even though I bought it for gaming,I can't even switch the weapon while 3 is not working.Buy better or get something valuable for your money.Placed a Replacement order on march 2nd now its march 6th there is no response from amazon and seller! It is taking more time even though I just waited for 4 days to arrive.And now it is taking more time get it replaced.I recommend to don't buy this or just buy Antec MK3000 which is even alot better for budget gaming."
1,"I bought this keybaord for gaming purpose but after purchasing i connected it to pc and started typing to test. Every key when pressed once will give output three times. Example if i type ""a"" key one time i will get ""aaa"" as output. I got it replaced with another keyboard with the same model. Even that one has the same key problem.The gaming mouse is another story, The scroll will never work after a couple of days of moderate usage. Better to get a simple mouse than go with this brand.This brand is totally waste. Don't waste money."
4,"The packaging was great and it was also delivered on time. The keyboard seemed heavy and sturdy as the outer shell is made out of aluminum, the key caps feels a bit harsh on the fingers, some of the letters seemed illegible even when back lit. They are great for casual gaming and for games where u can take your time, will not recommend for PvP games or online multiplayer games as they are not mechanical keyboard."
1,"The seller has sent over a defective unit. The backspace key, The enter key & the shuft key appears to have fused together. If i clicked on either the backspace or shift key repeatedly, it would register the key log as ""Enter"".The packaging too appeared a little worn out. It ssemed to be a returned item which was sent to me cause when i requested a replacement, there was none available."
2,"THIS IS NOT A GAMING KEYBOARD ! You may use this for general purpose use. The keys are squeaky. The keyboard is really ugly. The lighting is horrible. The letters do not light up - because due to poor engineering design the internal key cap is flooded with light but that does not permeate to the actual transparent letters ! The worst part is it make your table setup look really cheap and gaudy ! The name ""Red Dragon"" should have raised the red-flag !"
5,"I previously had a HP GK320, which was trash. Really speaking this is far more better. Everything is fantastic, especially the wrist rest and the volume nob. You can control its brightness, rgb movement speed and above all you can install red gear's own software to control the rgb lighting. Although it does not have per key rgb feature. Blue keys will remain blue and green will remain green. Still for the price I got (i.e. 2349), its really a great budget gaming mechanical keyboard. With fantastic key clicks."
1,"The packaging was extremely fragile and it was clearly visible that it had been opened before it was delivered to me. I used it for two days and on the second day some of the keys started acting weirdly, the down arrow key and the right side arrow key both were performing the same function so the keys were of no use. The W key also stopped working on the same day. Extremely dissappointed with the purchase. The keyboard itself is good but the product which I received was terrible. I hope Amazon will do something about it."
1,After using this keyboard for 4 and half months of usage this is the 1st and worst ever keyboard to go for Gaming or typing keys itself kept coming off on slight touch and malfunctioning also you need to press some keys very hard because they become very less reponsive save your money and go with cosmic byte or logitech and dont get blinded by useless video reviews they dont use it for months or years its just an eye candy
4,"This product is really good, it will give the feeling of premium ness and quality is really good build and click both.Two things to focus on,1. The switches are way to loud 😂It will not allow the person next to you to sleep thats for sure2. RGB OPTIMIZATION could have been done betterPs : love the volume knob and the feeling of it 🤩"
1,"First of all thanks to amazon for helping me out to get the refund after 6months also! The company redgear isnt responding to any emails for replacement and I was waiting for more than 2-3 months for replacement or any reply! Worst experience ever! My headphones broke down but cosmic byte support team was grateful enough to replace those for me as under warranty! So I recommend cosmic byte, logitech, hp and all but never redgear ! After sales support doesn't even exists! Their no. is not active and no support chat too!"
4,"Keyboard built is heavy with blue switches which means you will get clicky sound on each keypress.Keyboard quality is good.While typing using the upper row keys QWERTY, the bottom row keys gets pressed unintentionally but you can get rid of this issue using wrist pad/support, thankfully you got detachable wrist pad/support in the box.Typing experience is really good.Different RGB modes are available which can be customised using their inbuilt software or function keys but I am using the always on RGB mode as I am going to use this keyboard for coding not going to use this keyboard for gaming.Deducting 1 star as I didn't like the font on keys also there was some misprint and not perfectly engraved and miss finishing. Check @ & symbol in snapshot for reference.Also the volume control knob works fine but the play/pause button on top rotates as well when you rotate the knob. This is my personal opinion that the icon on the volume knob should not rotate as it looks odd. Check attached snapshot.Conclusion: Go for this keyboard and will love typing. Clicky sound of keys feels good."
2,"A month after receiving the wireless keyboard, the switch on the keyboard has started malfunctioning. The keyboard now works very erratically.I am unable to carry it the very long distance to the Logitech service centre in Andheri-East as I have a spinal fracture. So, to me this product has been a write off of the money spent. Logitech should not incorporate the switch on the keyboard. It is a component that is most likely to malfunction on switching it on and off every day. Can Amazon help me with a replacement?"
1,"KEY BOARD PARTIALLY STOPPED WORKING IN 15 DAYS... MANY OF THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING ONLY MOUSE IS WORKING , WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS SERVICE CENTRE IS 40KMS FROM MY PLACE NERUL TO GOREGAON ... SO FOR ME ITS LIKE AFTER GOING WITH BEST AVAILABLE KEYBOARD COMBO IM LEFT WITH MOUSE ONLY CAUSE ITS NOT PRACTICALY POSSIBLE TO GO 40KMS IN MUMBAI JUST FOR KEYBOARD ..."
5,"Great product.Pros1. On off switch on keyboard and mouse2. Caps lock indicator3. Shortcut keys like calculator sound etc4. Nano receiver5. Compartment inside mouse to hold nano receiver.6. Spill resistant,  has pockets beneath so that water that enters can drain out easily.7.Keys need very soft touch.Cons ( Not a big issue though)1. No num lock indicator2. Mouse slightly small than averageGo for it.Nice product. I got for 1499 in lightning deal."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size. Spill proof feature and the extra key rows on top are the best part of it. The keays are placed in a flat tray which has few small wholes under it to drain out the liquid, if accidentally some falls on the keyboard. Top key rows idea includes some dedicated keys for shut down, calculator, media keys etc.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent with an on/off button just like the keyboard, though its a bit small in size as compared to other normal sized mice. But, I think, its not a big issue, as you will get accustomed to it in a day or two.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
1,"The Ordered product is different from the received one. We ordered key board with mouse, along with battries. ""Logitech MK270r Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Wireles...."". And the amazon standard packaging is aslo not there. We received simply the logitech cartoon normal taped on the both the ends, resulted broken keys in this wrong product. suggestion to the seller and the amazon, Please try to improve these. I have returned to replace the same ordereded product. let me see what they are going to send."
1,"Clearly, there was a clarification that this is a Logitech UNIFYING technology. The reality was that it was not. The biggest problem is that it does not allow me to return the product. Only an exchange. I do not want this product since it does not have the Unifying feature. I still do not know know to return this product and I am struggling, as of now. This is a highly overpriced product."
4,"Before saying anything, here is the list of pros and cons:Pros:1. Build Quality, Looks sturdy, and premium.2. Keyboard's keys are soft to press, good for typing.3. The range is great (About 6-7 feet in my case).4. KB and Mouse both have On/Off Key.5. The keyboard has a Caps Lock Indicator.6. The mouse has an invisible optical sensor that means more battery life.Cons:1. The mouse is so small if you compare it with other brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo2. The price is a little high.3. Battery compartment cover on KB and mouse are a little bit loose.(But it's not like they will open by themself. Not a deal-breaker)So the overall package is good and you can definitely buy it. Just remember that the mouse size is a little smaller than the regular one. So if you have a big palm like me, you have to adjust to it but you will get used to of it."
4,"I wanted a full size keyboard to carry in my laptop bag. Most compact keyboards have the layout like laptops i.e. mini arrow keys and cornered page up/down keys, which is illogical because who would buy a separate keyboard which is EXACTLY the same as the laptop's keyboard?Hence I bought this Logitech one which was at a discount in a lightning deal. The keyboard buttons are super smooth, once you press a key gently there is no friction and the key will be pressed all the way down, typing is so much fun with it. Although it is a full size keyboard, it is still a little say 10% smaller than a normal PC keyboard, hence I can easily fit it in my laptop bag.Both the mouse and keyboard use a common nano receiver, earlier I had a wireless Dell mouse and I didn't want to insert two separate usb receivers for both keyboard and mouse, this logitech combo serves that purpose perfectly.There are batteries provided in both of these but they are normal AA ones, I replaced them will Duracell AA cell immediately on unboxing.NOTE: I ALMOST RETURNED this product because I COULDN'T FIND the nano receiver initially. It was supposed to be inside the mouse, near the battery but it wasn't there, the receiver was inserted inside a corner piece of the cardboard outer box, there is no indication on the box where to find it, luckily I found it before I clicked on the final return button."
1,"I'm unable to write much about the product because I received it broken. Out of the box, One key on the keyboard was out. Clearly the packaging and handling was the issue.It wasn't packed in an Amazon package. The box was just wrapped with plastic wrap. I could see the impressions of keys on the plastic cover of keyboard. It must have been under other heavy stuff. I'm returning this!Giving 1 star because of the pathetic packaging and handling. Otherwise, the product gives a nice first impression. Quick word after 5mins usage- both keyboard and mouse look good and top-row multimedia keys work good for calculator, play/pause, volume etc. 1 con though- the mouse wheel doesn't give a nice feedback, bit greecy."
1,"I opened the package 3 days ago and initially for a few hours the keyboard and mouse worked erratically. The next day the performance became worse, to the extent that I cannot work on the keyboard or mouse at all. While typing on keyboard, the characters appear on the screen after a lag of a few seconds, and then too incomplete.Unfortunately for me, the return window is not open anymore even if I used the product for only 3 days.I used to consider Logitec a premium rand, but now I have lost faith in all Logitec products. Complete waste of money.Complete waste of money"
1,"I purchased this product based on amazon suggestion. Initial product delivery was in damaged condition, so I have requested replacement, they replaced the new one today on 2020-06-17, but all the keys are not functional. I have attached the keyboard test as well to show how many keys are defective.When I buy product on amazon, I trust that amazon delivers best, but this is very disappointing, I expect product should be top notch and in perfect working condition. Hope you will take care of it from the next time."
1,"DO NOT BUY this model. It was good initially, but as days progressed, keys have become hard. Only if you hit the keys hard, you will see the letter getting typed on the screen. Support? Warranty? Dont get fooled. Support phone number given in the website says ""Switched Off"". No Support or Warranty at all. Logitech fooled me big time. Ordered two for my office and both are giving me problems."
1,Worst keyboard ever used i thaught logitech is the best productbi can use as iam using a wired logitech mouse for more than 4years i baught it two month back on amazon sale after few days it stoped responding after some time same with the wireless mouse so i asked helpnin amazon so the help and refund returnable was for only 10days so last two days back i went to logitech service and respond is worst they replaced it with new but still am facing the same issue it stops responding after sometime even after changing the batteries
5,"Though I don't like the curvy design, but the product is working fine. No connectivity issue. Mouse is small for a big palm like me.. at first I purchased Amkette Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo which has all the functions like all the indicators and a big mouse, but the mouse had connectivity issue and I had to return that. This Logitech combo has only Caps lock indicator but is working fine. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,This is a very nice combo of wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered it from Amazon a few months ago and I am loving it.  Keyboard are nice and soft you will feel like that you are typing on a Laptop. The keys are very comfortable to use. The mouse is perfect with  Nice respond to the commandBoth On and off buttons are provided on both the keyboard and about and they work immediately after turning them on.There is no delay in the commands.  Go to keyboard and the mouse are active and fast to respond I love this product thanks Logitech for creating such an amazing  Logitech for creating such an amazing home combo🥰
1,"It looks good, easy to carry and sturdy... But all that is worthless if the connection to the computer (or any other device) is bad....The dongle must be in line of sight for the mouse and the keyboard, else you experience a serious amount of lag. I ve tried changing the batteries to new ones and the problem still existsThis is what disappoints me..."
1,"After Missing the USB Chord on 1st order, when I replace, it is found that the arrow key of the keyboard is displaced to very far near 'A' button without unsealed the keyboard . Do you think it will ask for a rating ?"
1,"Does not type Upper Case K, P, D, & many letters. To type P we have to first type lowercase p and then replace that with uppercase P. Strange errors. Even after updating the software it wont become better. Updating is very difficult. The update software does not recognize that it is connected, even though it is connected. Strange keyboard of low quality. Local firms produce keyboards at cheaper price & of better quality."
1,"Logitech mk270r wireless keyboard mouse comboBought with very high expectations.1. The packaging was damaged as gou can see in image i attached.2. package seems to be already opened, batteries were already installed. One extra AA Battery installed in the mouse (not mentioned in package)3. mouse was already in ON mode with Aa battery installed.4. LEFT CTRL key was in the package  instead of being on the KB.5. ENTER key on the number pad is placed in reverse as  seen in image6. one battery installed in KB with other one and KB battery Cover lying loose in the package.7. The indicators in KB (caps lock), and mouse does not seem to light up.8. The USB RECEIVER missing from its place inside the mouse. so couldn't check whether working or not.didn't expect this from amazon. could have got the same from reliance digital delivered at almost the same price from the nearest outlet.Anyways applied for a replacement (as the product seems to be non returnable. shall update my review after i get the replacement."
5,- Soft keys press like butter- long battery backup 2 years for the keyboard and 8 months for mouse daily usage 8-9 hours except for sunday I'm using the same set of the keyboard since 2014 it's my next purchase.- No lag in connectivity also you can use when you connect your television operate from sofa :)- Robust build but bit cheap plastic compare to 2014 purchased model- If you want to use for office or home this one is perfect- The mouse is very handy medium size not too big or smallI'm rating this 8.5 out of 10
1,"Decided to return the product within few minutes of receiving it, for the following reasons.1. Both keyboard and mouse were very noisy..just can't bear the taka taka noise. Not only disturbs my concentration but I do a lot of Skype meetings in WFH mode and its extremely annoying for the paticipants on other side. 2. The pictures are bit deceptive, both mouse and keyboard are small. Keyboard width is ok, but the height is too small and I felt uncomfortable to use it. Prior to this I was using Dell KM 113, soft and no noise, working fine since Jan 2016, it has extra space at the bottom row of ky to rest hands comfortably, just that i needed extra USB slot for separate mouse, hence ordered this combo set.3. Mouse came defective ot of the box, light was not working.4. This feedback for Amazon seller, they sent me the item in a huge cartoon, which could easily fit a 32"" TV or 20-30 keyboard sets, see pic. Not sure what was the reason for such a huge cartoon, waste of resources and extra burden on ligistics."
5,"After 6 years, I've finally changed from my wired Microsoft keyboard to this wireless Logitech keyboard and this is my reviewPACKAGING: The packaging was good. It came in the Amazon plastic bag and had no cracks in it. The product reached me safe.KEYBOARD: My last keyboard had so much dust in them that they had stuck buttons which could not be easily pressed. This keyboard is like a blessing to my hands. The moment I switched to this keyboard, the keys felt so light to touch and has nearly no noise in them. The keyboard is large and keys are spaced right so that you don't mistype any keys. Also, the keyboard has a good alignment setting stands which makes it easier to type. The keyboard can be carried easily while traveling. It comes with 2 AAA batteries which promises to last 36mnths. The connection is strong and it works from every corner of the house. However, do not plan to use it for gaming as it's made only for office work/day to day activites.MOUSE: The mouse is great too. It's compact and lightweight and can fit most hands easily. My hands are a little big so I felt uncomfortable at the start but later it felt fine. The mouse response is good and there's no lag in response. Also, the buttons are easy to click and the wheel rotates smooth. However, they make click noise a lot. The mouse has a AAA battery in it which lasts 18mnths (per company). It also has a storage area for receiver.PRICE: I think the price is justified as you get 2 items for this price. An individual keyboard or mouse would cost you a lot.VERDICT: I think the keyboard is a must buy if you're planning to upgrade to wireless accessories and you need both devices.PLEASE VOTE HELPFUL IF YOU LIKED MY REVIEW"
2,Buy this wireless keyboard ONLY if you are just going to use it for basic use.NEVER for any sort of gaming. Keyboard and Mouse both lags on high CPU usage or game frame rates.there is no refund only useless replacement for this.I went back to my wired keyboard and mouse within one day. This is now packed back into the box...I will probably sell it for a loss on olx...
1,"After 4 months of infrequent use, the spring under some of the keys broke down. The product boasts of warranty of three years but it wont last even 6 months. The service centre at Gurgaon doesn't have the replacement ready. It takes nearly 10-15 days to get a new replacement. Till that time, sit tight and enjoy becuase you bought logitech product. Please avoid !!"
4,"I'm using this for 3 days only so its a quick review.Keyboard :Overall size is adequate for usage. Key sizes are a bit shorter than a regular wired keyboard of HP or Dell is what I felt bcos of which keys are going to next key than intended. Keys are noisy while typing, sounds like a less than 500 Rs unbranded keyboard which is not good for the brand.No comments on lag or range while typingMouse : I was using MK331 Silent mouse earlier, compared to that Smaller in size, and the feel is not good also click sounds are noisy. But this is not a silent mouse so accepted. I saw a bit of lag not sure whether this is bcos of something else.Overall this is budget pack.if you can extend a bit more go for MK345 combo, it claims quiet keyboard and the mouse looks like MK331 silent mouse but nowhere its is mentioned as M331 in the site."
3,"Review after 5 months of usageThe Good:The keyboard is good, strongly built, easily goes for years.It has all the keys you need, keys for volume control are really handy for me same with home, end button which are missing in my laptop.Works with Mac - Im able to use windows button as command key for (apple) mac, the Alt key as option key.It has caps lock indicator (light) which is helpful while typing the passwords.Not so good:However the keys bit hard especially when you are trying to type fast, you need to make sure that the keys are fully pressed down, otherwise some of the key may not be registered. The hard keys issue specifically happens when your finger touches the edge of the key - the key get kind of stuck between the adjacent keys. Its difficult to ensure that the fingers touch exactly in the middle of the key, its really annoying. This is happening more with windows key which Im using as command keyIf you want to really soft keyboard this may not be the option."
1,"Sometimes mouse and keyboard does not work, not expected from a company like Logitech"
5,"Even though this is not meant for Gaming, I have ended up using it. I thought we use a wireless PS4 controller so why not this. I also have a ReadGear Gaming Keyboard + Mouse combo and its started giving me issue in a year of gaming. I had to replace my ReadGear set with LG G102 Gamin Mouse and HP Gaming Keyboard K500F.This in comparison is working really well. All the Keys work fine, there are no misfires.. Its excellent. O have noticed some signal issues, for this I just make sure that the radio is connected on either side of the laptop (Not on one of the back USB Connectors)."
5,"Being a combo pack, don't expect a high quality product especially mouse.Keyboard build looks sturdy and when we type, we get some typing sound which is satisfying (this is subjective).Caps lock indicator works fine. On/off button works fine.Once I received product, I checked online if my keys are working fyn or not :D and everything is fine.Coming to Mouse, it appears with decent build quality(saying this because I have used lenovo 300(this is of solid build) earlier, on comparing logitech's mouse with Lenovo's, I observed it.).Battery, on/off button works fine. Mouse's precision is accurate and there's no lag.(even though if there's any lag, we can tweak the mouse settings).It was mentioned that battery life for keyboard is 36months and of mouse is 18months.When u turn it off while u r not using, expected battery life can be attained.Main reason I purchased this one is, I used Logitech K120 earlier, referring to its build quality, I got this one. And I needed 3 yrs warranty and good battery life with on/off buttons on both.Point to be noted : this is not a compact product. This one is a standard keyboard with all keys. So don't expect to carry it everywhere. If u need a compact one, u can go with portronics."
4,"I was actually pleasantly surprised how sturdy, robust and convenient this keyboard and mouse combo turned out to be.Pros:1. The keys are remarkably silent compared to many other keyboards2. The keys size and shape is sturdy and even the print is good which makes it super easy to operate3. Mouse is handy, small enough, big enough which makes it very friendly and reduces the chances of getting RSI4. Both keyboard and mouse have on/off toggle switches which is saving battery a lot and they last longer5. Indicator for CAPS lock comes handyCONS1. There are no indicators for Num Lock and Scroll Lock2. There is no indicator for battery levelOverallGreat value for money, if above indicators are added and keys are made slightly more silent, it will earn 5 stars on any day"
1,"After a firtnightly usage, with a sluggish and lagging Logitech MK270R keyboard and Mouse combo, I have thrown the KB and mouse into the dustbin. Such a badly designed product. It just literally slows down a 8 GB PC with ample storage space. Wireless connectivity to internet is getting slowed down. If I disconnect the KB and mouse from the computer, the net works normal and the mouse and keyboard  typing actions is taking ages to show up on the screen. I updated all the drivers including Logitech SPOT app. But to my dismay it has tested my patience prompting me to use the old PS/2 KB  and Moouse which are wired and work without any issues. Please don't buy this product."
5,"Great product from Logitech. Always recommend.High-quality product and is very durable, great precision.The mouse is Invisible Optic.I do both coding and gaming using this and surprisingly has a long battery life.Haven't changed the battery since purchase (before 4 months).Good for daily usage.Amazon delivery was great and arrived before the expected date."
1,"The product I got seems to be defective. The keys a wobbly, once you are typing, there is a lag.The product when I received was in a damaged package, when asked to the delivery, told he cannotdo anything about it. While typing the keys are getting missed.Not a product that I was expecting to be so cheap."
1,The keyboard and mouse stop and start functioning on a random basis.When actively typing the keyboard just freezes up or the unifying receiver stop responding and the keystrokes are completely lost.  This is a major issue when typing passwords. The same happens with the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer is jumpy or completely unresponsive and one ends up clicking unwanted things which becomes a waste of time. Contacting the logitech service center is also a complete waste of time. Think 2ice before buying it even though there might be offers on it.
3,"Keyboard:I’ve owned and used many, many keyboards—and I can confidently say the keys are harder to press than average; they have an uncomfortably soft feel. If a “good” keyboard is like tapping a steel spoon on a hard surface, this one is like pressing three fingers into a medium-hard pillow. Sound-wise, this might be good for some people though; the keys are relatively silent.There’s an extra, unnecessary line of multimedia keys at the top—as a result of which the Function keys are half the regular size. Plus, beware the dangerous “sleep” or “shut down” button: It put my computer into a weird hibernate mode. After waking from hibernate, two connected USB devices were getting disconnected and reconnected by themselves; I have *no idea* how that button managed this—it’s never happened on my laptop before! ...And there are a couple of keys that do nothing; I have no idea why Logitech thought it a good idea to bring back the multimedia keys that pretty much went out 10 years ago.There’s a keyboard on-off button at the top right. The battery lasts for more than a year; why would anyone want to turn the keyboard off?! AND as a result, there’s no space for the Num Lock indicator—only the Caps Lock indicator.Mouse:It’s too small for the average adult male hand—and probably the ideal size for the average adult female hand. The tracking is spot on—on various surfaces and surface colours/darkness—and the buttons are decent (neither too hard to press nor too sensitive to the touch). No idea about gaming.Range:As you’d expect from Logitech. You can use the keyboard and mouse from anywhere in the room, pretty much.Overall, this is mid-low quality, BUT good value for money. To summarise: Spend just maybe 1,000 more and get something better. Buy this one if you’re really on a tight budget—AND you have woman-sized hands."
1,"Within a month of use, the keys become loose and sometimes presses down on its own. With limited Service Centres (Ensure Services) and ""Great Than Thou"" attitude of Service Centre staff and Amazon ""apologetically refusing"" to do any help, I have decided to make it run as long as it dones and then buy a new one. Seems like few others buyers are facing the same issue. Anyway travelling to a service centre will cost as much as buying a new one."
1,"The mouse doesn't work and gets stuck.Even the scroll option doesn't work always.ADDING TO MY EARLIER REVIEW.......WORST PIECE OF GARBAGE EVER BOUGHT. i USED DELL COMBO BEFORE THIS, ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES FOR 6 YEARS STILL WORKS, JUST HAVE TO PRESS FEW KEYS HARDER ON THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE IS FLAWLESS. I CALLED AMAZON REP AND HE JUST PASSED THE BUCKET, AND TOLD ME GET IN TOUCH WITH SUPPLIER.  IF I HAD THIS MUCH FREE TIME WHY WOULD I BUY THE CRAP ONLINE. ITS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT, THE MOUSE WAS MALFUNCTIONING SINCE DAY ONE....THE CURSOR WOULD GET STUCK ANYTIME, SCROLLING MECHANISM IS A WASTE, DON'T WORK, KEYBOARD HAS ALSO STARTED ACTING UP....LOGITECH SUCKS...I DON'T KNOW WHY I WENT FOR THIS BRAND, NOT NOW NEVER WILL IT COME CLOSE TO DELL....CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THOSE SPEAKERS THEY MAKE AS WELL....JUST GARBAGE BASS NO MIDS, HIGHS,....WONT BUY ANY LOGITECH STUFF EVER......."
3,"This keyboard is good for it's price, Nothing extraordinary, serves it purpose.Pros:1. 3 years warranty, one of the few keyboards with that kind of warranty.2. Has a Caps Lock Indicator (Higher range keyboards don't have a caps lock indicator)3. Keyboard Layout itself is good, Keys are appropriately placed.4. Media control keys5. Long Battery Life6. Single receiver for keyboard and mouseCons:1. The keyboard deck has quite a bit of flex to it, a bit more than my liking.2. The mouse is not comfortable to hold. I ended up keeping it aside and using my M331 separately which defeats the purpose of a combo3. No Numlock indicator, I guess this would have been done to save power from keeping the LED lit all the time.4. Keys are a little mushy, I would want a bit more clicky feel compared to other basic membrane keyboards.5. Non Unifying, Would have loved it to be unifying so I could use it with my M331 in a single receiver.I have a M331 mouse, which comes with a nano receiver (non unifying) and a M235 which comes with a unifying receiver, and this combo which again comes with a nano receiver, I tries all possible combinations but I could not get this keyboard and my M331 paired to a single receiver (I really don't like the feel of the M185 mouse that comes with this keyboard)."
3,"After I received a used product once, I requested for a replacement and seller shipped a sealed piece this time.Product Review:Pros: No lag in keyboard or mouse. Both will last long. Both are very light weight. Ease of going wireless is unbeatable. I was not using desktops since almost 10 years now. A full size keyboard with that typing noise is nostalgic atleast for me. Hope it doesn't cause disturbance to others on the call while I speak and type. On and off buttons on both keyboard and mouse. Caps lock light.Cons: for this price point the buttons have to be noiseless. Printing of letters on the keyboard buttons can be of better quality, they look bloated without smooth edges. Also the bumps on F and G are just thin lines, you can barely feel them. People who knew typing will understand this problem. Logitech could have given 2 latch height adjustment, there is only one which is just ok.Consider this as an entry level wireless keyboard and mouse combo. Since this is from Logitech, I hope it lasts long."
1,I have has very bad experience with the warranty section of Logitech. I talked to the number given. First you to have to keep on trying. Secondly it when you reach them and explain to them the problem faced by you then they refer you to another number which they call it as Service Centre. If that is what they wanted to do then  why not give the Service Centre number then the other number. They just do not want to avoid servicing under warranty. I have been regularly been their customer for last more than 10 years. I am facing teh same prob lem of right c lic k being not working after ab t 8 to 9 months. This I faced it earlier but did not take it up. I am very diappointed.
5,its a semi mechanical keyboard and i can see the major difference between my old normal keyboard and this keyboard it feels so satisfying while typing on it it has RBG lights in it you can turn these lights on or off as required by just a click on scroll lock button its body shape is a little bit curvy which don't let it slip on the table surface and sticks it on a fixed position
5,unbelievable !  I get such a nice gaming keyboard at this price range. I am very happy with the performance of keyboard . lightning is also good . texture of keys make the keyboard very comfortable to use . price is very good for this types of keyboard overall I like this product very much and don't get confuse go for it .

5,The keyboard quality is great at this budget point. The lightning features is also good. raised key gives us mechanical  keyboard like feeling . Build quality is also great at this price. all the keys space is also very much good . Overall good experience with this purchase
3,Build quality is quite plastic and does not feel sturdy. Buttons had to be pressed a bit hard to take effect.There are other options available under 1K with aluminium build quality (MK 01).
5,"Love The Keyboard So Much, Amazing Feel While Using the keyboard as it is semi mechanical . Lights Are Pretty Bright So you can work in dark also. Looks Sturdy if used right. And Full Size Keyboard ."
5,Best keyboard at this price range. Quality product. RGB lighting brightness is eye comfortable.

5,Best keyboard in this budget... There are more expensive keyboard than this keyboard.. But this one is a lot better than them... Key pressing feedback is awesome .Default lighting effect... Build quality is also very good and strong..
5,Best keyboard in this range feels premium and the RGB light makes it a perfect Gaming Keyboard. Highly recommended.
5,Keys are semi mechanical and the rgb lights are in good brightness.Perfect for both gaming and office use.Good quality keyboard at this price range.I just loved it

5,"It's a decent keyboard with some good premium features. The build quality is quite good. considering it's low price, i was actually surprised seeing the build quality.Raised keys will give you mechanical keyboard like feeling.However it's a normal membrane keyboard.The LED's are very good ,it's bright but at the same time doesn't hurt your eyes. This keyboard can give you a premium keyboard's look and feel. Go for it if you want a good keyboard at low price.👍"
5,I just loved this RGB keyboard. This one is best for your gaming setup. I was just impressed with its great performance. The keys are very smooth and gives a satisfactory feeling while typing or playing. The RGB glow is quite good and conspicuous. Also we can turn the backlit off when not needed. And it also has stand which I needed the most. The palm rest feature is best for my long time gaming. Really loved this product!
5,The keyboard is just amazing😍😍 this keyboard is my best purchase till now. The rgb lights make it very premium. Also the build quality is just mind blowing. I am really happy with my purchase😘
5,Build quality of keyboard is Good and working is excellent. All lights glow clearly and useful and make flash in night vision colour of lights is make me more attractive to my work is really great things.All keys are removable and fit easily.
5,This keyboard is just amazing . It's lighting effects is next level and key button texture plus design plus quality is very good. This is best keyboard for gaming
5,"this looks so premium and epic. it has good typing sound , it can be connected to any pc/ laptop or even phone . it has so bright lights which helps in night and look so beautiful even in day light. great keyboard highly recommended."
4,very nice profuct according to the price.under 800rs i think this is the best combo for gaming and the keys are also made of very good material.
1,What is the warranty of this combo set ?? Showing on Amazon portal Three Year.>On product box One Year.>On HP site putting Product id and serial and found this is a fake item.
1,"I had initially given this 5 star rating but after a month of use, the keyboard has started giving me problems, the keys just remains pressed and the letters keep getting typed at random, say I press letter 'a' once but on the screen it will change to something like 'aaaaaaaaaaaa' and so on. It is become difficult to use the keyboard. I visited the HP website to register the product and enforce the one year warranty that apparently came with the product, but after several attempts all I get is a message that ""Invalid Product Code"" or invalid ""Product Serial No."" which means it is probably not a genuine HP product either"
3,"Pros:- a good deal- BT connectivity is good- easy to set up- mouse is okay and ergonomically feels good- keys are smoothCons- battery that was provided with the purchase was dead and the battery indicator on the keyboard didn't pick it up. I was thinking something was wrong with the connection as the keyboard showed up as connected but wasn't able to connect anything. It took me so much time to figure this out- the top row keys are pretty much useless since the markings are in black, it is really hard to see what is what until you flex your eyes- keyboard feels very compact and most of the times, I mistype. May be I was used to a much broader keyboardNo indicator of number lock and caps lock whatsoever. This leads to lots of mistyping"
4,Its look too big and requires lot of space.Apart from that everything is great its looks slim and mouse is perfect fit in hand.Always buy combo because one USB socket required for both keyboard and mouseIf you buy separate then you need teo USB port for both keyboard and mouse.Go with this HP keyboard and mouse combo
1,Looking at the box made me realise that it's quite old and poorly shipped. Later I checked and could see the side of key board broken.
2,"The Keyboard was really very good, apparently the mouse that came along with this product did not work at all. The Right click was completely out of order. Although I tried to change the settings, only left click was working.Finally within few hours of receiving this product, I had to initiate a return process.HP products are loosing their momentum .... Looks like they have almost run out of steam without much innovations happening."
2,"I would recommend dont buy this product. I was not impressed with the keyboard as the keys are short (though the layout is big) and you don't feel of using the key board. The mouse stopped working and now I need to take it to service centre. In Bangalore, there is only one Service Centre (at Jayanagar) and unfortunately, I have travelled all the way there. I do not recommend this... Prefer to buy these products from some other manufacturer."
3,"Mouse: The finish on the mouse feels cheap. It uses 2 AA batteries which make the mouse very heavy and uncomfortable.Also the mouse use a red visible light which  is not very efficient (that's why 2 cells) and the light shines through the scroll wheel which is blindingly bright ! On-off switc is very cheap amd wont last long.Keyboard: If you are buying it for the multimedia keys, then please don't buy it ! The multimedia keys are not printed so you will find it very hard to tell what key does what. Also the spacebar is horrible ! Feels like a very cheap chinese keyboard. I have to sell it at olx at 650 coz the return period expired.You better off buy Logitech MK270r..."
4,"Had purchased a Dell KM117 wireless keyboard+mouse combo last year. So this is a review comparing both.Keyboard* The keyboard is not exactly compact, but hey, it's a full layout with the number pad, so it's expected to be big.* Keys itself feel like cheap plastic, and a bit wobbly. Can hear kind of a rolling dice sound while lifting the keyboard up! :) Compared to an old HP PS/2 keyboard, these keys feel cheap.* No capslock/scrolllock/numlock LEDs.* People who love a standard QWERTY US-EN layout should be okay with this one. The Dell KM117 keyboard had a better feel to the keys, however it didn't have the right click menu key, Print Screen only with Fn etc.Mouse* Mouse is a decent one - considering the price range. Comparing the Dell/Logitech mice I had used over years, the movement is very smooth.* It also has a CPI button for adjusting the sensitivity.  Could be useful for gamers.* What appeared to be side grips on the photograps are not rubber, it's plastic again.All in all. 4/5. Go for it if you'r looking for a cheap keyboard/mouse combo."
5,This is the best keyboard and mouse. I love it 😘😻😘 If you want to buy slim keyboard and mouse just order this.Mouse is suitable for gaming and normal use and keyboard is awesome😍😍
1,"I got this note inside the packed item, saying mouse is not working and i think someone has returned it with note and amazon sell it to me what a shameful act amazon is selling second hand and defective item and product to its costumers, I think that buying product from amazon is not same now beacause they take money and sell you defective, used, and item which are return by someone due to some defect and now when i am returning it it will go to someone else so be aware.Not expected from amazon and now costomer care servive is also not available so well done amazon you are doing great job by fooling your costumer's Thankyou"
1,"It's the worst piece of keyboard, I have to press so hard a button so that a word gets typed on screen, sometimes it if it gets press easily, it prints the word several times the same letter. Overall the keyboard is not even useful for simple typing. If we perform ctrl+any key (operation) then the keyboard doesn't work at all. I didn't expect this from HP!!! Talking about mouse it's better."
1,"I am revising my rating from bad to crap. This product is not even worth looking at forget about buying it. I would have got a better product from a local gully market. The keys have to be pressed multiple times to work, sometimes at certain angle. My productivity has come down and frustration gone up since I started using this keyboard for my office work. Do not ever buy this product.Earlier review:I had higher expectation from HP. In the process of providing items for lower price, the quality has been compromised. The keys does not feel strong, I can feel the brittleness while typing. Some of the keys have to be pressed hard else doesn't work. I had used a wired keyboard at my office which felt extremely good, hence thought of buying one for personal use. But the wireless version is very bad to say the least. Don't buy this item."
1,The combo is just perfect. Only thing missing is backlight option on keyboard.STOPPED WORKING AFTER WITHIN 4 MONTHS. BETTER BUY WIRED MOUSE KEYBOARD COMBO. ANY WIRELESS ONES ARE UNSTABLE AND SHORT LIFE SPAN.
5,I was looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo for mainly my office work. And I've found the perfect product. This was the only product listed that had a full size chiclet keyboard and mouse with different dpi. This combo jas helped my work desk being less cluttered with cables and the look of both devices is very subtle.Only two things I was not a fan of were that first the scroll wheel could have been a little free and it would be better if the mouse didn't have any light feels gimmicky to me.Otherwise an excellent product.
2,Bought this unit in Sept 2020. The mouse stopped working and did not connect after 1 month of use and the keyboard also developed a manufacturing defect and the hyphen key (not used often) is getting pressed on its own. The product is useless and has a cheap design and feel. Not recommended.
5,Please go for this product without any second thought. Its a really a great product and i have used for few months and the performance and usage is best.I will recommend for all WFH users to reduce there nerve compression issues just in case if you are using laptop keyboard.Rather get one monitor + this keyboard and mouse.5 star product
5,"Frankly, I was actually have second thoughts reading all negative feedback about this keyboard but there was something about its awesome looks that made me buy it anyway..i hope it works as awesomly as it is working now. Feels good while typing. Doesn't make much sound.Mouse and Keyboard are connected with just 1 USB adaptor"
1,"Ctrl key stop working after 9 days of purchase, I am looking for replacement of the product but the replacement time period (which is very limited 10 days) has expired. @Amazon please stop selling #Fake products, if it is not Fake give me #Replacement. If i don't get replacement i will stop using Amazon and will start with Flipcart."
3,"Does the job. Works with both mac and windows, although you need to remember key combinations for mac. It is more of a looker than a productive/functional device.Caps lock indiacator would've be perfect but again, does the job. Keys are okay.Mouse too is okay, but I occassionally face issues with reception when I have other bluetooth or metal surfaces on the desk.Haven't found anything else at this price point that works with both mac and windows."
2,Although the keyboard is of good quality I had a hard time with the mouse. If it goes to sleep and you try to use it again there seems to be an issue. To resolve this I have to remove the batteries and put it back. Even that doesn't work sometime and I have to repeat it until you see the light fully come on.I would not recommend this product for the price point it is at currently. Really disappointed by the poor quality from HP
5,"the key board click is very nice as user experience is very nice,.  the mouse is too good  no issue such as latency or lag. everything is smooth and perfect.  hotkeys at the top is very much help full in playback control. yes, this review is after 20 days of use . its nice and build quality is also decent .  bought it for 1300 INR.  go fr it .  hope useful :)"
2,Keys are having some issues. It gets stuck in pressed position which affects duplicate characters in your documents and code. With this price and with this defect its not worth buying. Thickness is comfortable to use.
2,"I'm having nightmare with poor battery. The keyboard is powered with just 1 AAA battery, so response is slow, hangs a lot. Mouse has 2 AAA battery still response is very slow, even with Duracell alkaline battery overall performance is very poor. Highly disappointed with HP"
1,"TOTAL WASTE1. Keyboard doesn't have any LED indication for Caps Lock, Num Pad or Scroll Lock2. It interfers with 2.4GHz WiFi. Have to get another wired keyboard and mouse.Feel cheated, as there was no disclaimer about the possible interference."
1,Battery life is just 24 hours and your battery will die. I have used nippo which was used by me for 3 working days (8hour shift) and in Duracell it's 5 days max.Don't buy the product supplier won't reply you.
4,"Best productLight weightBest qualityEasy to clean,easy to installFastAll are offsomeBut*There is a littile screen in lop right corner,i dont know what is that for,*I didn't like the metal brush designBut it is better for some one elseOther keyboard has more drawback than this so this was best option"
1,"keyboard keys doesnt work properly.-> at times prints alphabet multiple times. use backspace to delete extra chars.-> most of the times need to press the ctrl and shift keys harder-> at times prints alphabets after a delay (few seconds)keys are messed up. it is frustrating to use.I thought it will increase my productivity, alas it is doing more harm than good.stopped using it."
1,"My most of the work is done in ms excel and involves lots of short cut keys like copy paste, select row columns.. and it is so annoying that these  doesn't work properly.. ctrl key won't most of the time... and after a month LHS SHIFT button does not work 90% of the time and you need to struggle using the keyboard if you use most of the short cut keys while working on MS Excel."
5,"Value for money, keyboard keys feels amazing while typing does not make much noise like other keyboards and mouse works smooth like butter. No complaints at all. Also, mouse has a compartment to place the receiver so it doesn’t get lost. Lastly, mouse turns off itself after 8 minutes to save battery. You can wake the mouse by just a click. Overall worth the money you are paying."
2,"IN FACT, I WANTED TO BUY ONE COMPACT LIGHTWEIGHT BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD-MOUSE COMBO FOR  i-PAD, i.e. IOS COMPATIBLE. BUT THIS ONE IS ONLY WINDOWS COMPATIBLE AND USEFUL FOR PC OR LAPTOPS. THEREAFTER I TRIED FOR EXCHANGING IT WITH ONE COMPATIBLE WITH IOS. BUT AMAZON VERY TACTFULLY GAVE ME A SINGLE OPTION TO EXCHANGE IT ONLY WITH THE SAME PRODUCT!"
1,"It get disconnected while working if you just give a 2 mins gap. You have to click on something to activate it again. Which can be frustrating while you are at work. And also top multimedia buttons are not visible, so you see the buttons but don't know their function until you bend your head towards them and look keenly. I'd recommend Dell wireless. Dell keyboard works great have no issues with it. Been using for more than one year."
2,"While  using this item, some are cons.& some are pros.Cons:- 1) Design is good  2) Proper packing on delivery time  3) Arrival on time  4) slick designpros:- 1) defective  item received for first time return process easy and another piece in just 2 days  2) For 2 days is working fine now  in key 8th key in num.  right section is not pressing while pressing any other key  automatically press. This Piece is also faulty.."
2,Mouse : Silent and smooth .Key board : Average. No indicators provided for CapsLock and NumLock. Multimedia buttons may be little larger.  Battery indicator is not working.
3,1. I  have used logitech brand. and found better in just Rs 1200 . I bought it in Rs 14992. I took it after watching functions and review specifically brand name HP. But disappointed after seeing its AAA batteries which were leaking and very old( totally drained). Not expected with HP brand.3. Overall good but found little bit costly also I had to add Rs 54 for 03 in Nos duracell AAA size to use.
1,"Ordered two for my daughters, one was faulty and mouse was not working, ordered for replacement, looks like vendour is still not giving a new delivery date, if not interested please refund and take the return."
1,"Mouse was not supplied with keyboard, neither the USB..."
1,"1) no led buttons to notify about capslock/numlock etc you are the mercy of guess while entering passwd.2) keyboard has high debounce issue3) mouse is not smooth, sometimes needs multiple moves.Overall looks like a low cost chinese product pretty much unlike HP product. Its like you get what you pay for. Better to invest a bit more and get a good product. This might not survive for few months."
5,"Im full fledge software engineer heavy duty on keyboards and mouse, so it may be an reason it only took 3 months to replace keyboard and mouse battery.But as far as confort and way this keyboard is designed is awesome.Its a complete value for money, I recommand this keyboard only thing is battery backup.Company please look into this issue, either make extra battries for keyboard and mouse find another solutions. Thanks"
2,The keyboard actually takes lot of space in length. I realized while working I had to stretch my right hand more to reach out to the mouse. This started causing pain and so I had to return it after one day of use.
1,"I bought this products and after a months its stop working  and service centre refuse to give warranty because serial no not mentioned on amazon invoice.More than 10times i called to amazon but response are worst every time.I highly recommend you all , Don’t buy at least Electonics from amazonCustomer’s service are worst. Hate it"
1,Received used product. It seems product is not genuine Hp product.It happened with twice on Amazon to receive used second hand product.Very disappointed..Never recommended any one to buy from Amazon.
5,"I have got this product today in two day delivery and I paid Rs 80 as delivery charge. And also got some Cashback. Must go for it.Some amazing features like light weight, smooth buttons and convenient for typing purposes."
1,"Orininal c2500 wouldnt be like this, you can check with the original image on ad, and product delivered, the window logo on window key is the way you recognize the product original or copy. better another 200bucks and buy original. rather getting repaired with copy in 6months. and wires are too week, board is not too strong, ill break in one bend. keys will get loose soon..  worst."
1,If you are really looking for a key board for daily use buy HP-KU-1156 or equivalent. 6HD76AA model is waste of money in my opinion. Also better you buy keyboards directly form shops so that you will know what you are getting. Since there is no return on this item i am thinking of throwing it in dust bin.
4,"The keyboard & mouse set is of good build quality. It matched the online description. The keyboard has great tactile feedback and provides satisfaction while typing. The mouse has good response too, be it the scrolling or clicking, both feels prompt. The price may be a bit higher compared to other brands like Logitech, iBall or Zebronics, but that's just me, nitpicking. Overall the combo is a good deal I could get at ₹840/-."
5,"i brought for my ofc, its good for the price.Pros: soft, light weight, mouse is ful size and comfortable to hold, easy to clean design.Cons: letters should have been much more darker ( means more brighter white color font)....you can buy for normal use, not for gaming pls....."
1,"I got a really bad keyboard and mouse. The quality is so bad that the keyboard is not fully flat. It has a curve due to the extreme cheap plastic quality. I was to continue using it due to the urgency but then some of the keys wont work. I needed to press two times. Password wont work and did not know the issue. Horrible product. I returned and got a Logitech combo at same price and no words to compare. Very good build quality, finish and I am sure it will run for several years. May be this HP product is good but what I got is fake mostly."
1,Pros: Cheap. Simple with no gimmicksCons: The keys are very hard to press. Broke after 6 months some keys not working. Keyboard real model name K45Other Thoughts: To be honest this is the worst keyboard i have used till date. My old acer keyboard was so good it worked for 5+ years and the keys were also so soft. It's a cheapo crap in the name of HP. Avoid at all cost buy something else.
4,This set I had to get it replaced twice within warranty. I don't know why but  my Keyboard stopped working twice within the warranty period. This is the first time I am experiencing something from HP. Now it is working well and I hope it does so in the years to come. My previous keyboard (also HP lasted 7 years)
4,"Basic set of keyboard and mouse. I got this as my keyboard had stopped working . The keys are a bit noisy and lack the premium feel, as mentioned , this is a basic keyboard with mouse which will suit your basic surfing and office needs, won't be much useful for gaming or rigorous typing work."
3,"The mouse works fine, but the keyboard is made of cheap quality buttons that started getting stuck while typing. The main keys like the shift, space bar and the backspace are the ones that keeps ghosting often. You might want to consider getting another keyboard. Since, the combo was a value for money, I opted for this one. Not worth the problems."
4,"Good professional layout keyboard without any fancy keys. For normal typing, it works well. But, some lengthy keys like spacebar already make some horizontal movements. Need to see the reliability in the long run. HP used to make sturdy keyboards earlier that used to last forever. Going by current standards, it doesn't seem to be the case.Mouse is good. Not much complaints there."
2,"The mouse is very light, and, good to use.The keyboard, however, very low quality. The keys are hard. Have to hit and not touch. The cheaper iBall keyboard is better. Bought this because of a discount.  Cost was Rs 649. Gonna keep the mouse, but will buy iBall keyboard."
5,"If you are looking for simple wired keyboard and mouse for your daily office purposes, this product is perfect. The keys of the keyboard are very deep which gives a nice old-school sensation while typing. The mouse is also sturdy and smooth. I wish the keyboard was backlit so I could use it at night with the lights off. But despite that I would say that in the wired category this keyboard mouse pair is the best."
3,"I have ordered this HP C25000 keyboard &mouse combo on 21st Oct, 2020 at 8pm and received it on 23rd Oct, 2020 by 10:30 am(being a Prime subscriber). Isn't it a swift delivery, yes never had this fast delivery on any ecommerce site.Coming to product:Con's1. Yes it seems to be a copy of original HP C2500 one.2. The key board is small and keys are too short, I am a medium handed persona and I can't type fast using this small keys, if I press one key, it may type two letters. Not at all suggested for office work which have extensive keyboard usage.3. A couple of keys seems to be very loose like both Shift keys, and T and a couple more keys very loose.4. Many said there is not much key tap sound, but it makes considerable noise while typing.Pro's:1. Mouse is big enough and works perfectly awesome.2. Both keyboard and mouse seems to be strong enough to last more than an year.3. Lookwise, stunning. Perfectly designed and apeleaing in looks.4. Brand, but again for me it seems a copycat.Hope this review helps. Thanks."
5,"All over good.durability 1year minimum for gaming users..light weight around 200grams.No technical issue, Buttons are very attractive and sweatable in case of typing..you can definitely purchase this combo pack.it will be very beneficial to you."
1,"Hi,After getting this product the key was very smooth and so comfortable to use, but after some time key of the keyboard start becoming jams and now some of the keys also not working...same with mouse, scroll got jamsWill not prefer this product to anyone, if someone cares for their money then he/she should go for another option"
4,Likes :comfortablesleek design of keyboardBoth light weightDislike'Clikkkk' sound when you click on Mouse.you may hear little noise in keys when you press on keyoard.. but not that bad..I would still recommend to buy this as this looks decent and working as expected.
5,"I use this set with my HP laptop for Work-from-home situation. I have not been a fan of chiclet-keyboard of any non-Mac laptops. So, I wanted a low-cost external keyboard. Ordered this set and it works fine. Touch and feel of keys are good. Of course, that is maybe because I like old-school type of computer keyboards! Overall good experience. Bonus: This Mouse, I am even using it for my MacBook Pro. Mouse works 10 times better than the so called magic mouse from Apple. Lol!!"
4,Good Product. When i open the box. Space key in missing but its still in the box. i fix it by myself and its wprking properly. Very smooth keys. Mouse is also very comfortable.  functioning is proper. You can buy this . after all good product. I'm using this for typing ot gaming purpose.
4,If u r on a tight budget go for it. But if u can spend more than 3k there r better options including mechanical keyboards. Both the keyboard and the mouse have USB connector. Performance is satisfactory. For the Price its a good deal :)
3,"Super flexible, feels like a little more force can easily break it. Light though. Better than chiclet i.e. laptop-style keys as these are half-height. Certainly helps in gaming. Do feel a little mushy, and give that feeling like, oh, this is so obviously membrane, and certainly even the cheapest mechanical kb like those redgear/redragon/cosmic byte can beat it in terms of gaming and typing experience. For the price, though, can't really ask more. Spend a little more and do youself a favor, buy the redgear blaze 3."
3,Keyboard is super smooth. Awesome keys.  Mouse was ok for few days but  after 15 to 20 days of usage the middle mouse button stopped working.  Keyboard is very good and mouse is waste. Better buy Dell mouse.Better to buy keyboard individually than combo.
2,"I ordered it by mistake, very flimsy product..finishing is very bad...no special function keys...Mouse is also looking ugly and both are not a durable ones...Please consider a different one if you are planning for a long term usage guys..."
2,It is so noisy and flimsy. You will feel typewriter effect while using. Not for office use. Wasted money on this.I wanted to return but there is no such option.Bought another dell keyboard - kb216p. Very satisfied with that.
5,Using this keyboard I am writing this review. If you don't like to press buttons really hard and want to buttons to be fast n responsive then this is the best keyboard for the job. I am using this key board for 2-3 months give me plsr.
5,Nice product. Quality is good. And the keys are smooth of keyboard. And the mouse function is very smooth and clickable is very fast. I refer to others buy this product without any doubt or questions. And one the thing I am not tested for gaming or others to use this product. I using it in my HP Laptop for general uses.
1,Mouse doesn't navigate smoothly just in couple of weeks of use. The curosr gets stuck at one place and you need to lift and adjust the cursor. Did not expect such horrible quality from HP after paying a decent amount.
2,"The mouse is too small but working fine and clicks good and is very responsive. I didn't like the low quality keyboard which will bend when you press slightly. Not very responsive and doesn't feel like a decent quality keyboard. Zebronics keyboard was way better than this. don't buy seeing the ""hp"" branding. I am using the zebrronics keyboard now."
5,"I am using it for last 6 months WFH, the keyboard is very good, the buttons are nice and easy to type. The mouse is easy to use and works great. No complains.Bought from https://amzn.to/3l2h0EG , the service is fast."
4,Thought its a spring keyboard similar to TVS. But its a normal keyboard. Ok for the money spent as combo of mouse and keyboard costs same in the open market as have saved some money for travelling to the computer shop nearby
5,As I am writing review after 3-4 months it's  Working well the quality not enough but good purchase at this price. It is not a gaming keyboard but it's good for office work and students for programming. Loved the product go for it
5,Good quality product. It was having a good longevity and very much comfort to use it. I made this review after one month and my suggestion was that go for it.
5,Good prodect keys of keyboard are soft and mouse is excellentLoved it thanks Amazon 😗😗
1,"I bought this because I felt like I could trust HP and oh boy I was wrong. Issues as soon as I plugged in :> Mouse's side buttons don't work.> If you make the DPI higher, left click will bring mouse cursor down by a bit making you lose target and click something else. This is HORRIBLE.> RGB on keyboard doesn't change colours. It's just coloured LEDs in a sequence. There is breathing, flashing and just normal glow. The colours are creamy and off too.---------------------------> I RMA'd both and got them replaced> Mouse click doesn't work anymore and return window---------------------------Summary : Do not buy."
4,Mouse light stopped working after few days ...But no problem in functionality.Best for beginners ... Keyboard is awesome .. does the job perfectly for the budget
5,"Amazing Keyboard and Mouse Combo Excellent for Gaming! I absolutely loved the soft touch of the keys, and the font of the keys on the keyboard. I didn't like the height of the keys though, it would have been even better if the keys were set into the body."
4,"BEFORE YOU BUY - The Keyboard shown in the pics are not correct. Unlike these pics, the keyboard doesn't have that rich roundness sort of grip on the keys (Check out my images). This is actually better for me since those grips cause slower key travel.So after hours of researching a good Gaming Keyboard Mouse Combo I decided to go with this one! This one seemed to have the best quality among its competitors in this price range (Got it for 1.6k). Here are the pros and cons I experienced after using it for about a month. I will be talking about the keyboard since the mouse is decent and nice. Just it's 6th button at the side is a bit loose, sometimes system doesn't detects when I click. Otherwise works well with day to day usage and gaming.PROS (Keyboard) -1. Build Quality - Metal Panel provides superb build quality (best in this price range). It's quite heavy so doesn't move easily.2. Professional Backlit - Unlike others, It's backlit looks really cool and professional. All keys are visible in night. The lights don't go off from the keyboard to surface which is amazing at this price range. Their brightness levels are perfect. Doesn't torcher eyes.3. Removable Key Caps - Key caps are removable so you can easily remove them and clean in case there's dust or something else. Also the sheet beneath covers all the area so no liquid can go inside.4. Satisfying Feedback - The typing feed back is nice. You might not find it that satisfying since it's not loud but it's good for me.CONS (Keyboard) -1. Backlit Customisation - It has RGB backlit but no customisation of colours. That means one RGB colour mode all the time. You can only customise the brightness levels and a breathing mode.2. Caps & Num Lock indicator doesn't work - I am using it with my Macbook Air. The caps lock and other indicator lights don't work. It worked a few times but now completely shut down."
5,"Good quality keyboard. Very comfortable for typing and gaming. Keys are well lit. Mouse build quality is not at par with the keyboard. Mouse is average for gaming.Note: some of the features (example, volume and keyboard lighting controls) of the keyboard are not highlighted on the keys so please read the manual before use."
5,"Good RGB keyboard,can change rgb brightness. Only it has rgb breathing mode.Mouse has 6dpi modes (800,1600,2400,3200,4800,6400). Side bottons both working perfectly.Overall best performance 👌."
5,"Found this keyboard the best one after purchasing and returning 3 keyboards ( Zebronics Transformer , Redgear , Cosmic byte cb-gk-05). Although its not mechanical but keys ka good and mouse also . Overall good product."
5,The Keyboard is Just Excellent.It is a mechanical keyboard as mentioned in the description and provides an excellent typing experience and the RGB lighting is well-lit and the mouse can be set to different movement frequencies.The Colours of the mouse can't be switched off but the Keyboard light can be turned off by pressing both the function key and Pgdown/Pgup keys.Overall this keyboard is an excellent gaming keyboard as well as a professional Keyboard at this Price.!!!!!
4,Great heavy keyboards wont bounce or move while heavy usage.Mouse is usable.. As a logitech g102 user. This mouse has similar body. Side buttons are lighter which make them more usable. Sensor is not a great one... A superfast flick will result in mouse losing the track and move the crosshair in the ground(it just move the cursor down).Cant say anything about switches they seem to work fine for now.Keyboard is great though.. Getting used to typing on this as i have always beean laptop user.
5,"I am amazed with this keyboard.Pros : Sturdy , amazing build , a multimedia keyboard it is !Cons : nothingKeyboard settings : Fn + pg down and pg up for brightness and Fn + 1 for breathing effectPs : it's not a metal one only finish is metallicMouse : it's awesome with it's dpi settings till 6400Pros : it is perfect fit for hands and too much comfortable , lights are amazing"
5,My son uses this keyboard when he plays online games. He reckons this to be a good one. I use it for typing and I feel my fingers are flying through these keys with significant speed.  I reckon this to be an extremely good keyboard for typing also. The Mouse is also very good.
3,for showoff it is great. if you you are looking for good typing keyboard this is not the one.Keys are too slippery and height is too much. if you have long fingures then its fine or else it is not good engough
4,"Well overall its a good keyboard and mouse, it does the job pretty well, I play games using this.There is no rgb, its just led's scattered around the keyboard but mouse has rgb but it stopped after 2 months of use and now it only shows red light.Well I would recommend it to you if you only need it for casual gaming and other basic tasks but not for professional gaming."
2,i thought this product will do the magic because it comes from HP  like brand  but trust me its horrible especially keyboard design is just awful ..even playing games will not be comfortable at all forget about typing or office work though mouse is okay for me and worst part it that you cannot return the product  so be aware before ordering
3,"I am using this keyboard and mouse for more than 7months . And Now I am facing some issues like the space bar is makes a ""kichhhhh"" sound something wrong with spring , sometimes mouse wheel is kinds sounds same while scrolling , again spring problem . And one more built quality issue is the front thumb button in the mouse is too far away. It is a struggle to press that button. Everything else is kinda good and well working but you should go for a full mechanical keyboard if you have budget.Again Review (I am using this product for almost 11months. Now I am having a issue with the mouse scroll wheel. When I scroll up sometimes it scrolls down and vice versa.., I don't recommend you to buy this product especially for mouse issue. Couple of months ago space bar was making a wired sound, That problem is fixed automatically currently no issue with the keyboard.)"
1,"Mouse stopped working in 15 days, I have given it to the HP service center for repair which is in Sakinaka, Mumbai. It was in warranty so I did not have to pay, but I have not received it yet and it has been 20 days. Product is average and the service center is also slow would not recommend this product to anybody. Please don't buy thinking its a cheap gaming keyboard and mouse from HP. This product is MADE IN CHINA  which is why I think the quality is trash. My advice is don't buy it. I did not expect this from an HP product. Never gonna buying anything from HP anymore."
4,"Keyboard. The keyboard is not actually metal, but a coating of metal over plastic. When this comes in contact of moisture, will corrode, creating black spots. And when you try to rub it, the coating will get removed. Otherwise everything alright.Mouse. The mouse has cool looking lights. But the side button and the scroll wheel are bit loose. You'll hear squeaking sounds after a few days of usage. The side 2 buttons are not so strong, but might show some ghostings. Also prefer using a unicolour mouse pad if you want your mouse to work. The red laser light won't register sudden colour changes."
4,"Not a gamer so maybe my review won't help you.needed a keyboard, to work from home and wanted it urgently, must say delivery was super fast; ordered in night and received next afternoon. keyboard and mouse both look good, key are little small for me and without led letters are barely visible but i will adapt to it. Considering its price,  i'am feeling wise to purchased it.And one more thing, tried but failed to turn off mouse LED, and i know it do turns-off as instructions are written in manual, maybe figure it out in future."
2,The mouse lost its RGB after 2 weeks of purchase and it deflects the mouse cursor while using and it glitches at times ....and the keyboard keys hangs for a sec....I've got a defective piece and ...I would like a replacement .... But Amazon replacement time is up ...so I'm going to report it non the less and use the warranty card
3,The external box seal was open ..got almost double size external box..amazon sticker was torn..the build quality of the mouse is not so good as well as that of the keyboard...lights can be reflected from the sides of the keyboard also the mouse upper body seems shaking ...that not properly fixed...had to keep since it was an urgent call..otherwise would have returned ..didn't expected this build quality atleast from brand like HP. Disappointed.
3,"The mouse stopped working after 15 days on nominal office usage, now need to visit the service center to deposit it, and then after 7-10 days, I will get a call to pick up the new mouse from the service center HORRIBLE!!!However, the keyboard is awesome and soft in function SUPERB!!!"
1,I bought this product and within 10 days keyboard numerical button stopped working . i tried to connect with amazon customer service they just back out by telling there return policy is for seven days only . now u r on ur own i tried mailing hp customer service they didnt replied. i been to one service center they refused that they dont do service for keyboards. so if u r buying this product u or on own.
4,"No matter whatever the product available, they will dispatch that one only, they don't care about customer choices, or feelings( I ordered a dark gray color hp keyboard but got a bright silver-colored one, Due to workload I can't return it and need to compromise with it. ) Dear seller, please produce whatever the client needed!! The product is working fine...Thanks"
1,"Whenever I am clicking ""W"" or ""D"", ""WD"" is getting typed, backspace is getting typed as ""="" and ""="" key isn't working at all, ""h"" is spelled as "" h' "" and "" ' "" is not working, some more keys have same problem. Some more buttons have the same problem. Very disappointing product for work purposes. And RGB is very faded even at it's max brightness. Mouse is all good(that's why giving 1 rating)."
5,Very nice product. Got it free with my HP Pavilion 15 Ryzen. The keyboard and mouse really seem durable and strong. keys travel are very good and the keyboard has RGB backlighting which has three different brightness and you can also switch off the keyboard light. Mouse also seems pretty solid and has DPI Switch and Forward and back word keys at the left side.
4,"Spacebar started squeaking from day 1 other than that keys are smooth and quick to typeMouse build  is good for the price as long as buttons don't give problems, also they make less noise than the standard mouse you get with hp pc4 stars for led brightness"
1,"Mouse Right Key  and Space-bar is malfunctioning.Pathetic product quality, how can they pass stringent HP QC?#DONOTBUYHP product"
5,I just bought this keyboard few hours ago. But it is very beautiful and comfortable also. I will upload the pictures after the electricity comes back. The RGB lights are looking awesome.
4,"Amazing Keyboard and mouse, Everything is working perfectly. Just pricing is higher than HP stores. So it's better to lower the prices than the HP stores or make the same like them!"
2,The mouse wiring and lighting conked off within 1 week if purchase and this was after replacing the first set where the mouse was reverse polarized as in if you move the mouse to the left cursor moves to the right and vice versa...very disappointed with hp dint expect it from them.
4,"Just got this yesterday and have to say the build quality is superb. The rgb is very good, the buttons are a bit highted so for me it will take time to get used to but they make very less noise. And the mouse is equally great. All in all both have a premium look and is worth every penny...!Would highly reccomend buying it...."
5,I like this product because it is fancy and easy to use it.......when we come to the keyboard ....there are so many function and there are multi shortcut way are there......by using function.....this was the first I am using this gaming keyboard ..........so i think this is right product for u when ur seeing to buy the a gaming kit
5,"Its 2 months now since i purchased this keyboard. The keys ""H, 1,2,3, PageDown"" are not working.Disappointed with the product."
3,"HP disappointed, keyboard brightness is low, the spacebar stop was broken, even after a sealed box. Mouse is amazing!, I like the size, but if you have small hands, just don't. Light brightness, and modes need to be more, Quality seems okay, not the greatest."
5,I like the metallic finish. The keyboard feels solid and looks good. It also feels good while typing. Especially the keys have a good key travel and hence i feel it comfortable while typing a lot. Ex : coding. It does completely fulfill my needs. I do recommend it for others.👍
1,"The keyboard have ghosting issues. I returned one where the left ctrl + left shift+ u and left ctrl + left shift+ p is not working, the product title says it's anti ghostingas a joke, i got a replacement but the new one have the same issue, for anyone who buys this one please check the key combination."
5,It's Just Amazing at this price point. It's better than zebronics because it has better dpi than zebronics.The feel of keyboard and mouse is amesome and is just to took to the another level. Guys trust me if ur are searching for combo go for it sure.its good value for money.In simply one word it was awesome.
1,"Dear Sir/ Madam,I have purchased this product through Amazon online shopping.  I liked this product. I am using this product for laptop. Now a days, I have some issues on this product. When i press some keys, some strange characters appearing on the scree insted of letter or number.I hope you will replace this product for me. It is undef warranty period.Awaiting for your reply.Thanks,  Best RegardsAbhilash"
3,"First time when I got this order, I got it in good condition but when I start using it, I notice an issue with the keyboard. When you press ""R"" on the keyboard it display some other alphabet. Same issue happened while press other words and numbers as well.Looking at this issue, I had asked for replacement, which I got after a 1week almost and when I got it I was shocked to see the condition of the packaging. It's was damaged completely and looks like someone has stuff the keyboard and mouse inside the box and tapped it and sent it. BTW the package seal looks to be already opened and later Tapped them. See the photo which I attached.I wanted to return this product and replace it but looking at the fact the delay which happen last time when I replaced, did feel like doing it again.My point here, when you spend certain amount of money on something, you expect to be good and well presented...."
1,"Worst product i ever buy. From Amazon part they delivered product on time but the product from seller even after replacement didn't work. Mouse & keyboard both goes off after two minutes of idle , i have to remove Bluetooth every to get connected again & Even u r connected mouse have too much lag.Stupid part from Logitech that mouse don't have any button to kept it manually on/off & Bluetooth is too big not like conventional Bluetooth it is just like pen drive .If possible try to avoid  this model."
1,"Design is so worse that we will definitely start using Laptop's keyboard again...1. Poor design2. Special keys (Backspace/Insert/ Arrow keys, etc) are stuffed into too little space3. Borderless keyboard4. Not friendly to typing5. No light indicators for capslock/numslock/low battery lifeMouse1. Heavy as you insert 2 AA batteries2. Look wise good3. Age old design of the wheel.DONT BUY...."
1,I can understand the need to save space but this keyboard is ridiculous. There is no caps indicator nor is there a num lock indicator which is extremely inconvenient. The delete key is a tiny button placed right up on top (next to the function keys). I just cannot understand how anybody can type on this thing. I tried to pass it on to unsuspecting colleagues but got a mouthful. I requested the seller to send me a better keyboard and that I would pay them the difference but to no avail.
4,"Concidering to the price point of 999/- lightning deal it was a good deal,, only cons what i think, there is no notification light in keyboard and arrow keys are very small definitely not suitable for the gamers,,, but overall in performance 5/5"
4,"I purchased similar logitech keypad and mouse around 4 years back. That time this product keys were some old fashioned and also the keyboard had sharp edges and was too sleek to handle. I didnt have another option looking at the price and delivery and opted for this. To my surprise, this keyboard has curvy edges, the keys are lovely and feel awesome while typing. The mouse grip and shape is super. The only flaw in this i would say is Capslock light. Only if this had a light for capslock, i would have rated 5 stars. During this electronic age where we use lot of net banking and online transactions, we cannot risk giving wrong passwords. But at this price this is an excellent product.Thank you Amazon, Thank you seller, and most of all Thanks to the delivery person."
1,"I can tell you this right now that if you're are looking for a sturdy replacement for your keyboard. This product is definately not it.1. The package is an absolute garbage. Both the product recieved was seemed like stuffed up product as is the delivery boy just picked up the product as a return and delivered it to another customer.2. The make of the product reminds you how Chinese manufacturers just are dumping crap in our backyard and even getting paid for it. It's all made up a plastic. I felt the only redeemed product is the mouse and felt it made the cut.3. The length, width of the keyboard and travel space of keys are just so crappy that it will leave you retyping everytime you use it.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
5,Awesome product I like this product very much as it is very helpful for those who want to use it wirelessly this is the best wireless keyboard in this price range as it offers more than its price only the thing that I didn't like was there are no LED is all over the body of this product but the plus point is it enhances the battery life and also it is only for professional use and not for The Gamers
5,"Working on laptops these days is a routine job. You are on a roll when it comes to your job! Thence, it is very necessary to get your hands on keyboard and mouse while you are working on Laptop. There are several reasons behind getting them. The major one being, since you work so much on your laptop, it becomes sometimes difficult using the mouse on the laptop. Also too much of work on the laptop makes the keys of the keyboard weak and they stop to function properly. This causes a lot of repair and maintenance expense.Therefore, it is important for you to get yourself a keyboard and mouse combo. So, logitech mk215 is the best."
5,"Super Awesome, I was so worried seeing lot of NEG reviews of defects and replacemens however I got it today and working so fine .. very handy keyboard easy to carry, keys are smooth.Mouse works smooth too. Completely satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Pros:1. It connects with Computers, TV and Phone seamlessly. (Usb port is a must for use)2. The battery life is impressive as i have not changed the batteries (supplied along with the set) since i started using it over 6 month month back.3. Compact design for a full sized keyboard is very impressive and looks good.4. Key pressing response and Mouse clicks are very good.5. The overall range of transmission is quite good as i have used it at a distance of 300 cm between transmitter and keyboard / mouse without any issues.Cons:1. There is lag in mouse whenever the bluetooth transmitter is placed behind the computer thus i advice to place the transmitter at a place where it has no obstruction between transmitter and keyboard / mouse.2. Please do not buy it if you are planning to do average or heavy gaming on it will not suite that. There are gaming specific keyboard / Mouse for that."
4,"These are a good alternative to my old laptop that sits at home with a broken keyboard. But if you plan on travel with it,don't even look at it.This is a good wireless keyboard for a budget.Pros:Wonderful keystrokesTyping is blissGreat performance / no disconnect or lagWorks with linuxLightweightMouse is light and nimbleCons:Little flimsy as a whole. One drop may break it.The arrow keys are badly placed, numpad could've been left out making the keys better.Not a deal breaker but cannot game on these.Mouse left click sounds different but works fine."
5,"very affordable and qwality product, logitech devices are always well built and works out of the box without issues... batteries were also included by logitech.... since the keyboard and mouse works on 2.45 GHz, they interfere with home routers working on same frequency...."
5,"Very good, compact, light keyboard. Only mouse is a bit heavy. No ON/OFF switch for both keyboard and mouse to save battery. You need to get used to this if you are accustomed to working with bigger keyboards. While keeping your hands for typing be careful about your thumbs positioned for using the space bar.  Keys function smoothly. To use The ""Rupee Symbol"" which is combined with the 4+$ key, you must look forward appropriate language settings and combination of keys to be used."
5,"Brilliant product , good quality ;1: mouse is very responsive .2: I have never seen such a good scroll button and soft clicks.3: keyboard is thin , light and very responsive .4: its true that it can be used from a 10m range ( I have tested it).5: just plug the Bluetooth stick and you can use it instantly.6: worth buying ( I would give it 6 out of 5 if I could ).I am satisfied with the product ."
5,"It is a pretty decent keyboard and mouse.  Detects and works within seconds. I have tried it with my mobile as well via the OTG, it works perfectly fine.The only thing which i am not happy is the size of the keyboard and size of few buttons. They could have gone with the conventional keyboard size which would have been more easy to user. Anyways you get used to it within few days."
1,In the six month of buying the keyboard the key such as U and S key when I press  then it typed the other characters and the computer is hanged. The function key is also not working and one numeric is 4 is not working . So the problem of this keyboard is the malfunctioning of  various keys. The other problem is that the numeric key 0 when i press it stuck.The one of the most problem is that on this keyboard the typing experiences is  very bad. So don't buy it.The model no is mk220 and amazon shows it mk215 why?Go for other keyboard like Hp . Worst for money.
5,"Best part is it comes with 2 two batteries.Pros:1) Very sleek and elegant.2)Unified wi-fi  di dongle.3) Very closely packed keys = less key travel + faster typing speeds(depends on your qwerty familiarity ofc).4)Dedicated multimedia buttons for fast access.5)Almost silent key press noise. But that depends if you're in an office or at home.6)Easy to grip and ergonomic.Cons:1)The up and down arrows are squished into a single key space.2)The mouse first feels very light but when u add the 2xAAA batteries, it feels heavy and also diminishes the weight distribution. That is hardly anything to complain abt once you're used to it.3)No backlight (ofcourse) cuz without lights it gets a tad bit frustrating for moderate pc users.4)Main ENTER key is really small. smaller than those on laptops... but again that you'll probably get used to it.5)No lights for capslock or num lock.I think this is the best deal for a wireless keyboard+mouse combo.Must buy.FUNFACT: I am writing this review using this keyboard. :P so yes it is NOT defective at all."
1,"I purchased it on 23.05.2020, After receiving I found there is no Caps Lok Signal. Nub lock Signal, scroll lock signal, we need all this indicators in current scenario for passwords. second thing its Number Lock  not a proper, you have press its after each & every 5 minutes . its really unsatisfactory a Logitech is reputed brand in keyboards % mouse .I already Purchase it Rs.1500/- during lock down period. Do not purchase it. Waste of money"
4,"I was initially planning to buy the Dell keyboard + mouse combo but it was not available for delivery in my area. That's when I decided to go for this.I'm not facing any issues and the keyboard keys feel good to use. If you like the feel of good old PC keyboard, then this one is ideal for you.But if you prefer soft keys, then you might want to consider the Dell one.Also it does not have a premium look. But its a good full size keyboard."
5,"comes with batteries for keyboard and mouse. both connect using one dongle. assembly is easy. size of laptop keyboard so might be difficult to adjust but for me it is comfortable. very satisfying to type on. i have connected this keyboard to my apple laptop and most of the functions like (windows +c) instead of (command + c) can be used. good quality mouse with three buttons (middle one to scroll, and the normal left and right ones) there is no light in the keyboard and it is very light weight but good for its price considering it is wireless and comes with a wireless mouse too."
5,"I was building a PC for our office colleague, they wanted a modern yet powerful solution for mouse and keyboard. The idea of buying them separate might be annoying as they both get separate receivers and have to connect them in two ports. It is not a problem but a modern solution is not that. So, I went for this Logitech Combo Wireless MK215 pack.Firstly, the packaging was so good. Nothing distorted and nothing unusual. All good.Keyboard: The keyboard is so smooth and noiseless. The key clicks are very operational and snappy. A new kind of keys are used. These are not like the mechanical keys but are very much buttery. No sound for any click at all. Even the space bar has no sound when you type. It is very much essential for any meetings where you need a quiet environment and even the keyboard typing sound becomes annoying. So, here you go, the soundless keyboard. Battery and keyboard installation was easy. All the things were in 100% good condition. Ergonomic design - means comfortable typing for hours. I type with 50 WPM, and it's so good for me.Mouse: It is the most advanced, minimal and modern mouse I've even seen. Exclude the Logitech MX master, that's too advanced. For anyone working from home or even for office, this mouse is well suited. No wires. No clicky sound. No laser lights from mouse. It is very very responsive and has ""INVISIBLE OPTICS"" - directly means no laser from beneath. Ergonomically designed. People like me with bigger hands can easily use this mouse.Receiver: ONLY ONE! Yes, only one receiver makes it up for both keyboard and mouse and they both work so good. We tried simultaneously working with them and it received those signals too. Very responsive and good feel.Keyboard is ultimate. Mouse is modern and super feel. Receiver is working best. No installation havoc and no wires. Absolutely stunning solution for anyone, who wants a wireless working setup.Keep an eye on the battery life, as there is no battery indicator for both as it is on the Apple Magic Mouse or Keyboard. The batteries might last for 24 months in the keyboard, because that experience with keyboard is amazing. Mouse batteries may last for about 5 months.Apart from these, it is the best solution for any office who needs wireless combo."
1,Product is good but delivery was very poor.  I received after 12 days with crushed package. Disappointed greatly on AMAZON PACKING. The seal has broken already. Keyboard looks modern but mouse isn't like that....... It is not easy to use if u already used single battery wireless mouse... I shocked at this packing.
5,"It has very tiny 'up, down, right and left' buttons. Enter, Backspace & Delete keys are smaller than normal.But you can't complain much because the keyboard only is supposed to be small as expected. so they have reduced the size of these important keys to make the keyboard small.For gaming of any sort which needs the direction keys, this keyboard is not the right choice. Good for all time word processing and web based duties.This mouse does not have an ON - OFF button - takes 2 pencil AA size batteries but last for more than a month. I use rechargeable batteries so I have no problem at all even if it lasts only for 15 -20 days. The Mouse is very good though.The USB dongle is the normal large one.. not the nano usb (thumbs down for this)"
3,"The product is good but Not suitable for multi-media purpose. It's small in size but I should have checked that before buying. The wifi connectivity is poor when I kept the CPU under the table and plug this gadget in the rear end. It does not work. It works only when It's plugged in the front USB. Sometimes the connection is slow with editing platforms. But once I got used to it, I am able to use it."
2,Logitech is a brand name and one expects a quality product. The first keyboard I received caused so much havoc with constant mistyping that my PIN got locked. I requested a replacement and received a new keyboard within 3 days which was great. The new keyboard seemed to work fine but has started giving similar issues. It randomly inserts Caps or odd letters or spaces while typing. You have to keep removing the pen drive and re-inserting to tackle the problem. And this occurs at least once every 2 days.Please don't bother with this product. It only looks good.
1,"I purchased this keyboard in Jan 2019 and now I have started having issues with the key. A letter ""A"" is gone bad and it types the letter ""a"" itself without pressing it.The bad part is that I tried to contact the Logitech customer service but their number seems out of service so finally I wrote an email to them 3 days back but still no response. Really bad service."
4,"Buying it the second time in 8 months and completely satisfied. The keyboard is pretty compact, but meets my need. First buy was in Jan and no issues so far. Mouse needed battery replacement after 6-7 months, keyboard still going strong.Bought it again for my wife now, bit disappointed with the delivery though. The box arrived without any external cover(waterproof), partially drenched in rain and box open as well(see pics). However, nothing was missing and its functional too.Giving it 4 stars due to the bad delivery experience the second time around, else it qualifies for 5 stars at this price point."
5,"I had purchased a wireless USB keyboard + mouse in 2018 or 19. While moving homes, the mouse got lost. I was using a wireless keyobard with a wired mouse on my secondary computer. Recently I decided to upgrade all computers, bought this full set.Pros:Product works like a charm on Windows, Mac and Linux. I tested on a a Dell Inspiron with Windows 10, a MacBook Pro with Mac Catalina/ Big Sur; a  MacBook Pro with Linux (Manjaro, Pop Os) and also on a Raspberry pi 3.Four words to describe the experience:Works Like a Charm.Thanks Logitech for an awesome product. Good battery life, thanks for sending the batteries too. Sometimes getting one set of batteries is a challenge.Cons:This unit uses both AAA (Keyboard) and AA (Mouse) which can cause a bit of hassle. My only gripe so far."

3,The mouse is perfect.The keyboard is very small compared to standard size full length keyboard. See photo comparison with Dell wired keyboard. So it will take a month or so to get used to small keys and closer key positions. But otherwise very good looking. Cells were provided and can be quickly installed. Mouse 2 AA and keyboard 2 AAA.Both worked quickly with Windows 7 and 10
4,"I'm using it with my laptop(windows, Mac, Ubuntu), Android TV and Android mobile(with help of a usb to micro USB connector).Everywhere it is writing as expected.And it is using only one USB port to use keyboard and mouse.Not sure about battery life. I'm really using it now a days and still I didn't changed battery for last 3 months.ActuallyOne drawback is there is no power button for more and keyboard. So I'm removing the battery and saving energy."
5,"Very Good product, particularly the keyboard. It has been around 3 years and 8 months since I bought and am using the product. The keyboard didn't even need a battery change, even though used extensively. Small and light weighted. Though the mouse's life was limited. I had to buy a new wireless mouse after around two years of use, as its left-click started malfunctioning due to tremendous use. Also, the wireless mouse requires battery change at around 6 months of use. But it's ok. Its hardly Rs.10-15 battery. And all wireless mice have a similar life. Better throw the old one and buy a new mouse as soon as it starts malfunctioning..."
3,"I have used wired Logitech keyboard+mouse and they are awesome. This one is nowhere near what you would expect from logitech. The look and feel of keyboard is ok but the key design-formation is very bad. Direction buttons are not usable at all even for people with small/slim fingers. The keyboard is actually very light as compare to its contemporary Dell wireless keyboard and is no better than Rs 300 wired keyboard in anyway. Mouse is nice and has a good response time. Overall, not recommended for a person who use his computer for any kind of typing work. Ok for people who only want to surf web."
4,I was planning buy a mouse and keyboard for my laptop finally I went to this product and buy it 1200 rupees only. It's wireless combo and very simple to use it .. if you are planning to buy a keyboard and mouse so you can go for it ... If you satisfied to my review so you can press helpful ...  👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼Thank you!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
1,"Don't buy dis productTotal waste of ur money 💰--U don't feel real keyboard typing becoz its 35% smaller than original keyboard--keyword sometimes gets mismatched with ur typing--no indication of light--no button to off both mouse and keyboard--Not up to mark--suggestion -buy dell keyboard with chicklet typing, good feel, soundless--manufacturer don't seen how a wireless keyboard be total shit--don't worth money--i could have not give single star ✨--continuous emmision of radiation becoz product has not got key button to off it after its use.THANK YOU."
1,"I have purchased this product through Amazon online shopping. I liked this product. I am using this product for laptop. Nowadays, I have some issues with this product. When I press certain keys, strange characters appear on the screen instead of letter or number, even some Apps pops out.Waste of money"
5,this is my 3rd pair of wireless mouse and keyboard from logitechone of the most comfortable keyboards and mouses ive ever usedthey claim 24 months battery for the keyboard and 5 months for the mouseand it works as claimed and the mouse battery literally stood for over 24 months !I love thisGo ahead and buy it
3,"I am using this product since 9th July, 2019 and now facing some issues.1. When I press some keys, some strange characters appearing on the screen insted of letter or number. It's going on repeatedly until I disconnect and reconnect the batteries of my keyboard.2. It was said that battery life of keyboard will last for 2 years. But unfortunately. In the initial stage of working with the keyboard, every time I have to disconnect the batteries of the keyboard and then reconnect it, otherwise no key button is working.  However, once connected, it is working fine.  So I do not understand here whether it is a battery problem or a keyboard problem, although both problems are very serious to me.  I really depressed about what Amazon is saying in the specification and what is actually happening. Therefore, you suggest me or inform me what should I do to come out from those problems."
5,"Pros:1) Ultra thin silicone material that protects your keys from water splashes and dust.2) Sticks well without any adhesive, it's a perfect fit for my Macbook Air m1.3) Does not dim the backlit keyboard so you can use this at night as well in dark rooms.Cons:It's a 500 bucks keyboard protector, ismai bhi cons dhoond rahe ho :pNone that I found."
4,"On the plus side, it's thin, flexible, and fits the M1 MacBook Air 2020 perfectly.However, it reduces the contrast and effectiveness of the backlighting, and you have to type a little harder. Having had keyboards damaged by water splashes on two previous MacBooks, I'm willing to put up with these two minor issues, rather than coughing up Rs 20,000 because two keys don't work.That said, this cover does not provide adequate protection around the perimeter of the keyboard - you still need to be careful"
5,"If you live in a dusty city like Mumbai, I feel this is a must have product. The cut is PERFECT, you’ll only see slight bumps in 1-2 spots, which is totally fair. Can I type with this on? I type lightning fast and key feedback is critical to me, so what I do is take it off when I have to type a lot. I don’t want to criticize the cover for not giving me the same feedback as an actual Mac keyboard. I put the cover back when I’m using it with photoshop, or browsing. Ever since I got it, my keyboard has been squeaky clean. People are complaining about the price but being aware of how rare accessories are in India, I’m just glad that someone is at least selling these. For 150-200 you will get poor products. Why do people want poor products? Let’s get the good stuff and use it for a while. Even if it protects my Mac for 6 months, I’m more than happy."
4,"It is ok product, when it comes to covering keyboard. it dosent fit perfectly, so when you type you can feel cover above your keyboard is moving vertically. Horizontally it fits perfectly, vertically all key shapes are slightly bigger than actual keys.I am using this with MacBook Air with M1.Worst part about this product is, it's Made in China."
4,"It's pretty soft, fits well, looks good on the gold version, my 4 yo niece loves it!. I'm keeping it but there are just 2 flaws with this product that i noticed.Check the pictures1. The function key symbols on the f4 f5 f6 keys are not correct. The symbols have changed on the m1 model, but the symbols on this protector are from the older model.Seems like the manufacturer used the old model keyboard layout. There is a cut out for fingerprint so this is indeed for the m1 model, it fits well, but the symbols are incorrect2. The letters/ text/ symbols are a bit off from the keyboard beneath. If you use it with keyboard backlight to the full, you can see the backlight bleeding thought the cover and notice very obvious, wrong alignment. Specially the fn key, it has the text on top right and a globe icon on the new model, but the cover has only fn printed on the bottom left. Just like the old mac air.One good thing is that it let's the backlight bleed through, so you can use it in the night with the cover on (if the print was too thick i would need to remove the cover in order to see the backlight.Plus now because of the colors in the night it looks like a rgb keyboard 😃I would say go for it, if you're okay with these little issues"
4,"The overall product quality is great, I'm satisfied with the purchase.Pros:*Thin and soft*Fit's perfect*F and J key indicators.*Almost feels like invisibleCons:*Keybord click sound will disappear also typing becomes bit difficult.*Thin, I know I mentioned it on pro's as well but it's too thin that it may damage pretty easily.*It didn't fit well at the corners(F12 & arrows), I think it's not with every product I'm just unlucky.If you are someone who uses keyboard alot and likes the sound that magic keyboard makes, please don't go for the keyboard protector because I don't think any other product can fulfill it.If you can compromise over sound and want protect your mac from dust and fluids on the table you can go for this."
4,its cover is very useful because of  our surrounding lot of dust & sand particles .it is harmful for keyboard button lot of dust are stored inside button so its not properly working so these cover are useful for protect from them.
4,"I have been using this since last month. I’m a filmmaker & writer so I have to type a lot. It feels soft and easy to type upon. To what I have a goy in 500₹ is something I believe is a little overpriced. Decrease the price by 150-200₹ and it’ll be worth because, before buying I thought it is quite hard and tactile but it a little softer. Other wise all good, fit is 99% good. There is always a scope of improvement. So keep it up. Cheers."
5,"Especially in India we have a lot of dust in the air, so it is quite uncomfortable to clean laptop keyboards every now and then. So, I bought this case for my MacBook and it is an awesome fit. I surely recommend everyone to take this for their MacBooks. Great Job by the creators."
4,"Pros -1. Super thin and fits well for the MacBook Air M1 Model A23372. Colours look great in the day and night3. Doesn't affect keyboard backlight visibility.Cons -1. Not that adhesive but that's okay because the fit is well2. Two of the function keys have different icons, eg the microphone one. Basically the new MacBook air doesn't have function keys for keyboard backlight brightness but this skin does.3. The keyboard print for letters don't align perfectly with the skin. So you might see a shadow or double writing. (I avoid this by keeping the backlight off during the day and turn it on in the night. Once the backlight is on, the printing on the skin doesn't even matter because all you see is the Mac's keyboard keys. Check pictures.Conclusion - Somewhat expensive but does the work and looks great. Comes with minor faultsI'm happy with"
5,Does not really stick to the keyboard but it offers firm protection to the keyboard and prevents it from any scratches or scuffs.It is no way value for money since it costs ~ten times as compared to what it takes to produce something like this.Looks good on my MacBook Air M1 though!
2,"Excelllent packaging from amazon, really wow packing but disappointed from product. Just see pics.update: - Thanks amazon I have received a replacement, the replacement product is free from manufacturing defect but not a perfect fit, not a perfect flat... you will have to remove for typing fast.Final - not worth 499/-, ok for 150-200/- as mentioned in another review."
3,"It does serves it's purpose, that is keeping the keypad dust free. Before using this, my mac used to get dirty, specially the keyboard area, but this product solved the problem. It only has one con that, typing becomes a bit difficult when this is on relatively to when it's not. I don't know about other products, if they too cause the same problem. Check that yourself, dear reader ! ( from their reviews )P.S : It's still manageable !"
1,It is very plasticy. If you want to use keyboard u will have to remove it and use. It's simply plastic cut to fit. Should be priced for 200Rs max. My previous macbook's keyboard protector didn't have such quality issue.
4,After a lot of search I decided to try this keyboard cover for my m1 macbook airThe cover sits perfectly and key presses don't feel that bad as I expected.I was worried about the small dust particles and this product definitely solves the problem.
4,Avoid keyboard covers as they create marks on screen which in long term left untreated can cause serious problems. MacBook is designed very precisely and with negligible gaps. So even keyboard cover this thin can cause strain on screen.If you are clumsy and u think that u will spill something on keyboard and u need this then don’t forget to clean it regularly
3,"The product is thin and hopefully durableFits well on the keyboard in the middle but is slightly lifted towards the edges. So given that the purpose is to protect from dust collecting on the keyboard and going inside, it would not be doing a good job towards the edges. If you can live with that, then at 499 Rs. it's a decent purchase."
5,It's a good product.I was facing the issue of dust creeping into the gap between the keys. This helps solve it!Mostly you don't even notice that there's a cover on once you use it for a while
4,"It does feels good when you are typing. But I wont suggest it if you use keyboard all the time, it might come off easily. The F4 F5 F6 switch looks different than the original ones. Other than these it’s a good product and you can go for it."
4,"I am using Macbook Air 2020 i3 10thGen. I ordered the transparent one.Most important thing to keep in mind if you start using this, remove it when you close the lid of your lptp, otherwise it might damage screen in long term use.What I liked 》》-  matte finish-  perfectly fits on the keyboard.- it sticks to the keyboard while you are typing."

5,"A great product description, helped a lot while decided to buy it. Does everything it says, perfect fit, prevents dust and accidental spills.. doesn't fall off ... Doesn't effect the key responsiveness much. Must say a good value for money product."
5,"Bought this for my MacBook Air M1. Its sleek, transparent, sits flush on the keyboard and feels perfect. The delivery experience was great too. Although I dont support the price to be so high for a thin sheet of silicone but I guess you have to get used to that buying Apple products."
4,"Good Product at the cost taken, Quality & Fitting Is good, just it does not provide adequate transperency to backlit keyboard.But yes on terms of protection, it keeps the keyboard safe from various spillovers that might happen. Also gives a good grip to typing, no hindrance in key travelling. Also reduces sound while typing.Good product, by quality, look and price."
4,It’s not fully perfect but still the best . Looks good and quality also . When you type u feel little different. Normal use it’s fine.the rubber layer is so thin and fit precisely for keys
5,"I was skeptical about the size and fit. But after long thought, bought it.It fits well on MacBook Air-2020 released model -A2179.It covered all keys except the Touch ID.Super thin (can’t find a better one).Good one!"
3,"I thought this sheath will be sticking to keyboard but i was totally wrong, Nevertheless but it fits perfectly to it  still i have maintain that it doesn't fall of."
3,It is okayish. Go for it. Quality is above par. It is not sticky. But let's see how it performs over the time. Let's hope it doesn't turn pale yellow.
5,It is so transparent n fits so well that u can’t even figure that there is a cover!!! Though a little expensive but worth.. am happy with the purchase
5,"Fits perfectly. Sits in the macbook slot just fine.A small tip, after application run your finger over all keys with slight pressure (without pressing the key). That will make it sit nicely on the key edges."
2,"It fits fine on the MACBOOK AIR KeyBoard. Clearly visible all the letters on the keyborad. But the edges of the cover on each key is not soft as it is on the middle of on each key. If we press any key on the edge of a key it won't get pressed. It doesn't let you type fast, really frustrates.OVERALL I WON'T RECOMMEND, IF YOU WANT TO TYPE FAST."
2,"Just got it today. Had ordered the green one. The color is much darker than it looks on the images. It feels good while typing. The alignment of the letters on the actual keyboard and the cover is moved by a mm. It cannot be used in the dark as it is not transparent, the backlight on the keyboard does not come up. I am using it on M1 Macbook Air."
5,"It's a very little to the expensive side,but it's ok if you want to save your MAC's keyboards with dust and protecting your keys from stains and patches.It's very sleek that it does feel like it is there or not,it perfectly blends and fits over the keyboard."
4,Good. However the thickness could be little more and it would fit on the buttons perfectly.
1,Video Player is loading.
3,"The problem i have with this is that it blocks the backlight of the keyboard and some of the key's commands are not the same as the MacBook air m1(specifically saying the F4,5 and 6 keys).Everything else is just fine."
4,"Nice product, fits the keyboard very well. It's very thin, but doesn't feel like a 500 rupees product.... A thin film of precision cut (with machine) silicon or rubber for 500 rupees is too much"
5,Amazing product!! Completely worth every penny!! 100% satisfied. Go for it without second thought!!
1,It does not fit properly.Don’t waste 300-500 on this.You can see in the pics I attached - the cover is not properly fitting
4,The product is good and does the work however its over priced. Ideally it should not cost more than Rs100!
1,"Positive:1. RGB works2. Keyboard has a nice matte finish3. The keys are soft to press and overall responsive4. The logo is nice addition5. Price - and it was a lesson (dont buy cheap)Cons:1. The size of the keys is unconventional, i play CS GO and when replacing my lenovo keyboard assumed that the manufacturer will follow standards prevalent. But herein the keys are larger than normal which resulted in me having to change my game play (cannot duck anymore or in the middle of a busy firefight i end up on my windows desktop page!)2. Return policy of Amazon requires the product to be defective, damaged or not functioning. Hence i cannot replace this useless piece of junk because Amazon is more than happy to ship this back to me, albeit in a new packaging. When your product isnt in line with the prevalent manufacturing standards you (Amazon) need to have an option to return the product and for pete's sake just provide store credit if not a refund.Very disappointed Amazon.3."
5,"Writing this review is very emotional for me as I had to bid goodbye to it today. It was like an extension of my body for over 2 YEARS. It was one of the best keyboards I have used.I bought it in January of 2017 for ₹2000. Since then this keyboard has gone through a lot of torture. I play games a lot and many times I would hit the keys brutally during intense moments (READ RAGING). Nothing happened to it though. During it's service, it had tea/water/cold drinks spilled on it multiple times. Cleaning the keyboard and drying it was more than enough to get back at playing. The RGB Light intensity didn't reduce over the years. The Blue light is exactly the same as that of Logitech so it paired well with my G300S and G402. The Red is the same as that of the fans of my case so it was a match there too.Here are some of the PROSThe FN Keys are really handy along with swappable ""WASD"" and ARROW KEYS.The Wristrest is big enough and although made of plastic does not irritate the skin.It's a silent,""laptop like"" keys. Great for late night gaming.The keys are spaced apart perfectly FOR MY HAND SIZE. So no fatigue over long durations.But it has a few CONS too.Some of the keys (Spacebar, Backspace, etc) are not completely lit and it looks kind of bad but they are not easily noticeable.The RED BAND along the bottom stands out when the keyboard lights up in some other color.The Numbers in the NUMPAD never worked for me. Might be a software problem.To conclude, I would say that if you are not head over heels for Mechanical or ""Mechanical Feel"" keyboards, this is a good and durable keyboard."
3,Keyboard has ghosting issue serious one. You cant press s d and i at the same time. Other than that there is no problem. My Rs. 300 keyboard works fine. What a waste. I dont know why the S D I press at once when holding won't register as an button input. The uneven back lighting I can live with that.Delivery of package was good. I recieved the box a bit crumpled. I am giving it a 3 star
4,"If you are looking for the best, yet cheapest, membrane keyboard, then this is a great option. However, the keyboard is not free from faults. The size of the keys is fine and so is the cable length and weight of they keyboard. Coming to the review, I will first mention the cons:1) This is a well-built product with a full layout and some macro keys and dedicated media control keys. However, the placement of such keys is not something very well thought of. For instance, The multimedia keys for volume set is not as tall as the other keys and are behind the function keys (F2 to F4), so it is not comfortable to reach especially when gaming. Same goes for the media playback keys that are also behind the keys on the top row.2) Now coming to the macro keys (G1-G6), they are also awkwardly placed and spaced. The height for such keys should have been much lower than the standard keys. And if they were placed properly, finding the Ctrl and Esc keys would have been much easier. Sometimes I end up hitting G1 instead of the Esc key and G6 for the Crtl key.  Also, they are somewhat paired, There is some gap between the G2 and G3 keys and G4 and G5. If that exists for some hardware-related reason, then I cannot complain more.Now that's the only con I could find apart from one other minor con that's not a huge bummer for me, but could be for some folks. Read point #5 for that. Now, coming to the pros of the keyboard:1) Typing and sound: It's a typical membrane keyboard and feels like one. Typing is fast and accurate and doesn't make my fingers feel tired or lethargic. The keys are less noisy as compared to some other membrane keyboards. This was one of the reason why I didn't get a mechanical keyboard. Now I can type at night while others sleep peacefully. I type somewhere around 70-80 WPM, so I type a lot and it's comfortable with thi keyboard.2) Size: This is a full size keyboard so you also get the numpad. I don't like how  every maker is assuming that these peripherals are only meant for gaming. Good thing Redragon made this keyboard for both work and multimedia.3) Font: The font used for the letters is plain and simple, honestly, that's how it should be. Some other makers use such bad fonts that the keyboard looks like a mess and hard to understand. Thank you Redragon for using normal font. With this, the keyboard looks more professional and aesthetically pleasing.4) Wrist rest and Ergonomics: This is an ergonomic keyboard but not a dedicated one. And the wrist rest included is quite nice. It uses magnets to snap to the keyboard and is comfortable when typing. But if you lift the keyboard up for some reason, then the wrist rest won't hold to the keyboard and would fall off. Without the wrist rest, they keyboard would lose much of its comfort as it will raise the height of the keys.5) Lettering: The lettering on the keyboard is transparent. This is good for longevity, as the letters won't fade over time. But, if the RGB suddenly stops working, then the keys might be difficult to see. However,  You can still manage to see the keys in low lighting. In good lighting, they are clearly visible, although  not like a regular keyboard. So this might be a con to some, but to me it's not an issue.6) Anti-Ghosting keys: They say there are 26 anti-ghosting keys. While I haven't tested all of them, they work mostly. One odd thing is that Left Ctrl+Shift+Esc doesn't bring the task manager up. But if you use the right side Ctrl+Shift+Esc, then it works. Good thing they have marked the keys with a line below the letters.7) RGB: Honestly, I am not a fan of RGB, but they way you can just make the RGB glow at the lowest level is so nice. I can clearly see some keys that I rarely use at night without them shining like a car's headlight in my eyes. You can choose static light or random colors. Yes, white is there, so is green and red and blue and yellow and cyan and magenta. You can also turn it off and practice your typing at night. It's fun, trust me.8) Macros: You can customize the macro keys accordingly via the software or through keyboard. And because the keyboard has a built-in memory, it remembers the assigned function or key combination even after uninstalling the keyboard application. I have used the G6 for mute function, as this allows me to mute and unmute in a flash without moving my hand, just with my pinky. This is so important to me when gaming and using headphones, as it gets done in a snap. Extremely handy for my need.9) Keyboard lock function: By using Fn+F11, you can lock the keyboard. This is a nice feature that lets you lock the keyboard to not let any registering of key presses.I will update the review as and when needed. I hope this helped."
5,"I bought this keyboard for my second computer, which I use for typing. My main computer already has a Razer Huntsman Mini. I do a lot of typing and I have a high speed of about 110WPM(Words per minute) I know that I should have bought a Mechanical keyboard because they are fast at typing, But I just found this Shiva keyboard and I bought it because I have used Redragon's Phaser mouse as a budget temporary mouse so I thought let's buy a budget gaming membrane keyboard that also has macro keys. Even though it only cost me only about Rs2000 which compared to the Huntsman which cost over Rs14000 this keyboard exactly felt like I was typing in a Huntsman this is so good. It even has a consistent clear RGB that most of the budget gaming keyboard doesn't have. Most of the budget gaming keyboard has RGB that shines at some point and then there will be a part where there is no RGB. Love it"
5,My first gaming keyboard very good experience this keyboard thanks Amazon and redragon i love you
1,The product is not good for gaming...u cannot use multiple keys at the same time...i was playing cod and pubg...its the worst experience u can't peek while sprinting...while i m playing cod. Cant use socrestreaks when i press something not working in a way it should be...irrtating...the only thing good about this rgb lighting...worst buying experience..by time realised where was the problem..the return window time closed...to this product...ita a shame..
4,"Upgrading from a mechanical Dragonwar keyboard in a pandemic lockdown.I chose The Redragon Karura K502 as it was affordable and I love a good matt finish on keyboards although it is very difficult to keep it dust and stain free.Also, I've never done serious gaming (FPS games) with a membrane keyboard which has island style chicklet type keys. It looks very sophisticated. It is one of the quietest keyboards I've used come across and would highly recommend it for someone who has to type a lot and does not quite like the clickety-clack sound of keys. As of now I don't find any issues with the space bar key not registering or the enter key being too small or far away for the right pinky finger as noted by some fellow owners of this keyboard.It does take some time to get used to typing on it as the keys are spaced out (low profile membrane keyboard, much like them Apple Macbooks) but i believe that happens with every time one changes keyboards.Backlight on the lazer engraved letters on the key caps is not uniform but its definitely better than what I was using, so no complaints there for me. Font could have been better.I received the keyboard one day earlier than its scheduled delivery. Thank you Amazon India."
5,"I'm extremely satisfied. Don't listen to fake comments. Truly magnificent and a premium keyboard. Not a mechanical keyboard ,but feels so similar to mechanical keyboard. Excellent built quaily.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼I don't feel any cons. Keys are soft and good."
5,"Edit - Well not the best I guess. The plastic really attracts lot of oil and grease from the hands. Also, this does not have n-key roll over so you cannot press more than 2 (or 3 not sure) keys at the same time. That's pretty annoying while gaming.I am someone who hates mechanical keyboards. I'd been using the HP Wireless Elite V2 for a few years. It was the best chiclet keyboard on the market. But sadly it gave up on me. So I narrowed down this beast. I never purchased reddragon products and was worried about going with them but boy oh boy has this blown my mind away. The quality is just amazing. Even though it is fingerprint and dust magnet, I just love the product so much.Just go with it. You won't regret it."
3,"For me, the aesthetics of the keyboard were the primary reason for buying it, and on that front, it delivers! It looks absolutely amazing out of the box. The lighting effects are great. The wrist-rest is actually pretty comfortable. That's where the good things about it end though.Let's talk about the cons-1. The key presses are a little inconsistent. Some keys, like the ""h"" key are a bit harder. (May just be a problem with my unit though)2. The typing experience is not very good. Agreed, this is a gaming keyboard and not one meant for long hours of typing, but still. If you're planning to get any work done on this, it takes a while to get used to the spacing and the layout, and the inconsistent key presses make the experience worse.3. The keyboard looks great, but only for a while. It has a soft-touch material all around, which has a comfortable ""feel"", but it attracts fingerprints and smudges like CRAZY! Within just a few minutes of usage, you'll notice the keyboard deck getting all smudged, and that's with clean hands. So, be wary of that before buying this.Undoubtedly, there are better keyboards out there in the price range. Wouldn't really recommend this one."
5,"Man, for real this keyboard is so good. It has everything said on the description and the rgb lighting is really cool. This is my first rgb mechanical keyboard and I really love it. No problems so far and I would recommend this keyboard to all. For real tho, the name of this keyboard read with the brand name is the best way to flex haha"
1,Received a defective keyboard.  40% of the keys including the 1st row of keypad are not working.Update:Had to return the original one and got a replacement today.  And surprise !  even this is defective.  Two keys in this is unresponsive and are not working.  So have opted for refund.  Amazon should not encourage such spurious products.
5,The only proper RGB gamming keyboard at this price.Value for money decent built quality no complaints.The palmrest feels better when compared to laptopsWell placed. I would have preferred the keyboard ergonomic to be a bit curved which would have made the product ideally perfect none the less great keyboard.
3,"update :left ctrl+shift developed ghosting issue. Those keys works individually but failed to execute any shortcut together. Awful experience while coding :(================A great RGB backlit keyboard with soft chiklet feeling.You get lot of keyboard lighting options including different color combination static as well as breathing style. You can increase or decrease frequency of backlit flashing.Typing is comfortable and have good feedback.cons:Little time to get used to small '\' button.will attract dust, cover it whenever possible"
4,"This is totally satisfying keyboard especially, the click feedback feels very premium even than my Dell business laptop keyboard which I though was the best keyboard feedback i have seen which isnt the best now, but this Redragon is.The only issue I felt is that, everytime we disconnect and reconnect the keyboard, it goes to the default RGB lighting pattern which I dont prefer.Everytime you need to set it in the lighting mode you want."
4,"The lettering is very sharp and is as they say laser cut. Clear lettering and easy to read with backlight on. The colour of the writing is not pure white. So without the backlight is is not good.What I did not like about the keyboard is the feel. It is supposed to ""offer less resistance"". But, it is not that light to press. Especially, the space bar is hard to press and sometimes we have to press it again as it would not have gone down in the first press."
5,I wanted to get a mechanical onebut decide to go for membrane onethere are 6 setting for rgb but it goes to its default setting every time you start your computeror unplug itso keep that in mind before buyingstealth clicks for night gaming that's how i would put it.no one will know your gaming in the night :Dif your working from home this keyboard would be a best choice since it doesn't make sound when clicking buttons no one gets disturbed.mechanical ones make too much noisethere isn't any software from redragon to control the lights for this model.using it for 7 months with no issues.
4,"When I was left with my earlier keyboard not working..i found this on amazon and this is first backlighted keyboard. Delivery services and packaging was okay. When i opened the box i instantly liked this keyboard. The first thing you will notice is its looks and build quality. Looks better in hand. It has good rgb lighting pattern and can be changed easily....though can give you a bit of confusion but the manual will come to rescue then. It has some matte finish but can get easy scratches with very sharp objects. So i recommend you to use carefully. Typing is easy with this but if a key is pressed too long the key gets struck in that pressed condition. And same goes for gaming like A,S,D,E keys gets struck. Otherwise it is a very beautiful keyboard but is a bit tough"
2,"The backlighting of the keys are not uniform. Some keys are partially lit. I wish i could have paid attention to the detailed reviews in this section prior to purchasing. And now i can only replace but not get a refund. Already initiated replacement process; hope they ship a better product this time.Also, the packaging was damaged and all seals broken."
3,the price can be a bit less.  there are number of keyboards lower price than this which have keys softer than this....betters its price reduced in the 1200 to 1300 range
5,It's good just go for it good wrist rest which is deatchable and this is more than u expect if ur lokking for a memebrane keyboard which is fells like mechanical one and is way quiter that it just go for it it's extremely good
1,"Absolute garbage. The first time I ordered it, many of the keys weren't backlit properly, as shown in the photo. The f1 and all f keys were not working. On replacement I was facing the exact same issue. My refund process took more than a month. Very disappointed in Amazon and Redragon. This retailer has no ethics and made my purchase a miserable one. My order went out on 20th December 2017, I got my refund on 9th February 2018. Don't go for this garbage chicklet keyboard."

5,Excellent keyboard.Hand rest is very comfortable for long typing efforts.Has backlit green colour light.Cost effective.  Good for gaming and normal type work.Has additional keys G1 to G6.Good packing.  Thanks Amazon retailer.
1,"It is a good choice for anyone, but if you are taking it for very much of typing work at first your hand will slip over the keys so much, because they are flat. You feel like typing on laptop keyboard. It's brightness is not good daylight, in the dim room, it's good-looking.But after one month it has stopped registering the keystrokes for multiple keys. This keyboard is a kind of hit-and-trial product. It might go well in long run or might not.Also red dragon support team is the worst of all.Thank you"
5,"There are hundreds of -ve reviews about it. But still i bought this because it like simplicity, yet lively with RGB and a must have wrist support.Cant comment about durability. Will Play BF1, BF5, Fortnite, TC: Wildlands and update later."
3,"It's been at least 9 days since I'm using this keyboard. It's great but the space bar gets springy over time. You get that springy noise when you type on it. But well, who am I to complain about the price. It's great. But I would recommend going a little higher on your budget and buy a mechanical keyboard Like the redragon Kurama or the 551. But for the price, it's great."
4,It is very good for typing and gaming but if you game on it extensively it will clear the paint off the keycaps as they're not black keycaps but clear ones painted black and my A key has a small hole in it after daily use of 2 years and my s key has small dent in it overall the quality of the keycaps is decent but not good if you're going to use it 3hrs on a daily basis
3,First impressions give off a premium feel & keyboard looks excellent to eyes but keys could have been more evenly lit along with more vibrant printing to give a more premium feel (maybe due to its price). The keyboard material attracts lots of dirt especially oil based from hands & get very harder to clean & maybe never same the same look as untouched after usage. But overall it is fine.
5,"Amazing Gaming keyboard with ""best in class Rgb""Really handy and smooth Chiklet keysButton Precision is Good7 Rgb colours with 6 different Modes to choose withGot this for ₹1399Multimedia Keys"
4,"The keyboard has a very good mechanical feeling to its keys. Rubberised texture truly elevates the look. RGB is really great. Looks really good, evenly distributed and has a lot of modes to play with. It even has a dedicated software. The arm rest is easily detachable and is also good looking. The only caveat is that the spring in the space bar really does make a racket, although I'm willing to put up with that, since I really like everything about this Keyboard."
4,"I received my order today and was very disappointed.Firstly the Keyboard is silent AF, but it does take time getting used to. There are 7 backlight colors which are good overall but on keys like space bar and the backspace, it fails to illuminate the complete button.I could have rated it 5, but as the subject line says it differs from the original product, as per the video reviews and photos posted on Amazon, it should have a few lighting effects like rainbow lights, running lights, but the delivered keyboard has everything except the extra effect for which the keyboard is popular in a budget gaming range.I suggest waiting for it to drop down by Rs 200- Rs 300 to compensate for the missing functions, I am still unclear if the Reddragon decided to remove it or if the retailer imported the wrong model of this key board.Also, Avoid using the quick function while playing games as most of them dont support these features.Edit 2: Received a Karura 1 instead of 2, why amazon why?"
4,"I have been using the Redragon Karura K502 keyboard for a year now. I bought this for 1249 rupees. This seems like a copy of Razor Death Stalker keyboard which is more expensive one.So they made two version of this keyboard. The one which I got is the new version. I will tell you what they improved in the new version, you can watch reviews on youtube for the old and new one. To distinguish the new one is the see the transparent stripe on the space bar. The new version of the keyboard has a short stripe on space bar as compared to the long stripe.In the older version , keys were mushy and inconsistent. Like for example , keys were hard to press and the space bar was not uniform ( if the press keys from the end point , they might work , you had to press in the middle). The new version improved on this one. It seems they added some reinforcement down there so if I press the space from the end point , the whole thing goes down and work.Using for a year , a key started to malfunction. For me the right arrow key registers more input even if I press it ones. I will press the right arrow key one time and it will register like 15 or 20 key strokes which is definitely very annoying sometimes. Sometimes this issues resolves itself and sometimes this issues comes back. So I never thought of complaining to support service. Other than that all keys works fine.One things I noticed , I used the Dell chiclet style keyboard and the keys over there are hard to press. while on redragon keyboard , I really like the keys on this one , atleast on the new version. They are soft to press and It gives me pleasure of some sort typing on this thing right now.For me , this keyboard is really good typing, it takes a while to get it used to as the never used a chiclet style keyboard. This keyboard is silent but not that silent , over the year keys are making more sound , my space bar makes a buzzing sound idk why , maybe the spring or the enforcement down there.Some of the cons I noticed are :if your device loosed power , it will go back to the original lightning effect , the rainbow flashing one which i am not a fan of . So everytime when I trun on the pc , I have to cycle through the color which I like.If your keyboard is provided power if the pc is in sleep mode , the color will not change.One major con is the back light on this keyboard.  Light Color are not accurate, if the put it on the yellow light effect , some keys are not yellow but reddish and it is issues with most color. the red , blue and green does not have this problem but other color especially if you want to use white color only, some keys , like left most or arrow keys lookes  red which really bothers me. I think this is the deal with every model out there.If someon1e out there is thinking that this keyboard will not acquire dust , maybe you are right but dust can definitely get under the keys , but the thing I like is that dust will not get under the actual circuit board as there is some leverage under the keys.I love this keyboard except that malfunctional key and the inconsistent light on this . Other than that I love typing on the keyboard and palm rest is quite good too.PS : I not a big gamer , I don't know much and test that gaming functions but I don't care about those things."
2,"Others have already listed the pros of it, so I will not go into that.My primary concern with this keyboard is that the CTRL+L-SHIFT combinations did not work.The first time I received this keyboard, I thought this might be a fault in the unit itself, replaced it, got the same defect once again.Looking up online, this seems to be a common issue with this keyboard (might be an inherent defect itself).For me, most of my work revolves around keyboard-shortcuts, many of which are CTRL+SHIFT combinations (I am a programmer).  Yes, you can circumvent this issue by using the R-Shift button, but I do not want to change my habits because of this one single model.Even the cheapest keyboard I have used so far (350₹) supports these combinations."
1,"I am totally disappointed with the packaging. The product came in a squished package and almost damaged. Blue colour from the cover got on to the silicon cover in patches. It's not sticking properly. Longer and wider for 14"" laptop keyboard. Doesn't fit properly."
5,"Crystal clear keyboard protector. All keys are visible properly. It fits properly on a 14 inch laptop, protects the keys from any kind of dust. It sits on the laptop very well, no need to stick it. Just what I needed!!"
5,"Non slippery,Easy to Use which I liked the most and this is my second one for my office laptop. Happy with the overall fit"
5,Excellent accessory to have for any laptop user. Easily stucks onbthe keyboard and removable for washing.
1,Its not sticking properly ... and its size is also big so now its coming on my mouse pad as well... transparency is bad with lots of blue marks on it...
1,"Waste of money .It looks like cheep 20 rupees keyboard cover .Blue colour got sticker to the cover,it looks uglynd also there are so many patches . Do not put single rupee on this item."
1,Quality is very poor. Very cheap china item. Not usefull. It doesnt stick or stay on the laptop. translucency is very less. cant see keys properly. Will probably throw it away in 2 days 😅
5,"Durable, thin, fits well.. it is worth the cost."
4,Ok product with less transparency
1,Looked fine at first but after some days it completely came out. All adhesive is gone and it’s not at all sticking to my keyboard!
2,It not suitable for realme book 14 inch
5,Good product good quality good basic need for the laptop keyboard
5,Nice Product. Surely Recommended for 14 inch laptops
1,"Longer and wider for 14"" laptop keyboard. Can not be used, unless cut to size down."
5,Big size even covers nearby other buttons... :)
1,Useless quality of the product. Dont buy this
1,Do not buy
3,Very thin.not durable.No adhesive.
1,it is not sticky and it has been mooced ehen we try to type
5,Good Quality Product. Useful item.
5,Quality of the product is very good
5,"User friendly, removable, washable. Now laptop is safe from dust And liquid spills. Value for money."
5,"First things first!This is neither a mechanical nor a gaming keyboard. It is just a normal keyboard with colorful LEDs under the keys. Again they are not back-lit for each key. It is basically difficult to read the letters on the keys.However, I liked it because it is very nice when it comes to typing. It is light. Keys are responsive and very soft to type. The looks are very impressive with the colorful lights underneath keys.Also, I don't blame it for not being mechanical because at this price it would be obviously impractical to manufacture it.So verdict is, Good for home and home-office use. Not for Gaming.Oh! The last thing, I received a faulty one for the first time and requested for replacement. Both Amazon and Seller were prompt and punctual on the replacement."
4,Best KEYBOARD for gaming and light weight
5,"Have always trusted HP, never been disappointed. It's a light weight keyboard with backlighting. Three modes there... lighting, beating, breathing! The Fn key gives you some additional options which are great. The build quality is solid...metal top with good quality plastic keys. The lighting colors are sober and decent, nothing flashy about them. I wish the fonts (type) were a bit more legible. But, overall a great keyboard to buy for all purposes!Pros:Solid build quality.Sober lighting colors.Nothing flashy about it!The keys have a mechanical feel to themCons:The font (type) could have been more legible."
4,"Pros:Sturdy build quality and brand value of HPDependable anti-ghost keysGood key prints, won't get washed in 5-6 years.Anti-Spill proof.Cons:Key strokes never feel like mechanical.Lack of MM keys.RGB functions are limited.Value for money - this keyboard will easily last at least 5-6 years given the build quality. Don't expect too much about the feel as it's still just a membrane keyboard."

4,Compared to other gaming keyboards it feels I little underwelming but for this price it's pretty good. And it looks really great as well. It's also built in pretty good quality. At first I didn't want to buy this cause of the lack of many reviews but I'm glad I did cause I couldn't find any other keyboard in this good quality for such a decent price. If your looking for something at a low price but good enough to get the job done this is probably your best bet.
5,It properly justify it's price. You can control it's brightness level. You can also turn off the light but you can't change it's colour. By default it has rgb lighting as the the picture shows you in amazon. You can also put off every single key for cleaning.
5,"I don't normally write reviews unless I really hate a product or love it. This is the latter. I wanted an external keyboard for my laptop for some casual gaming. I wasn't expecting much looking at the price but was pleasantly surprised. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:• Looks great (even better than it does in pictures)• Good for casual gaming (cannot comment on eSports)• Great value for money (compared to the competition- Redragon, Redgear etc in this price range )Cons:• The letters aren't legible without the backlight (which doesn't matter, as you shouldn't be buying a backlit keyboard if you want to turn off the backlight)• The space bar is slightly angled towards the front which makes it uncomfortable to use (Easy fix is to use some form of a wrist rest to raise your hand to match the height of the space bar.• The colour scheme cannot be changed. I initially thought we could change it to a single color but that is not possible. The colour scheme you see in the pictures is what you get. However it does look a lot better in real life. You can change the brightness of the backlight and also change the modes (between beating and breathing) which is pretty good but I prefer the default setting.Note:I don't type too much so I cannot comment on that. For what little I've typed on this keyboard, it's pretty comfortable.I've never used a mechanical keyboard so I can't compare this to one.If you're looking for something that looks good and can be used for casual gaming, look no further."
4,Perfect gaming keyboard with good quality under such a price. But if you know how a mechanical keyboard feels and you expect a mechanical feel from this then that's not possible. But if you have never used a mechanical keyboard then you will definitely like the special feel that this keyboard gives. It has its own unique feel. Rgb lighting is nice and can has 2 lighting modes with brigtness adjust. No woobleing keys.
5,"For this price range this is the best keyboard u can get .Build and quality looks good .Only issue i felt was , keys make a lot of sound when u press but i think its a common think in low budget gaming keyboard ,anyway on the ones i have used but so far best one is this one.If ur r coming form a normal keyboard , it will take some time to get used to this keyboard .For this price range go for it ."
2,"My review after using for 4 months:If you really want ""kind of RGB"" lighting in your keyboard for nearly 1000 bucks more than a regular keyboard only then you should consider getting this one.# Kind of RGB  - no actual control over the lighting, only the rainbow kind of rgb is there you cant switch to any color of your choice. just 3 options like breathing and control the intensity# Quality: Although it looks like metal and i was impressed in the beginning, later I realised it was some cheap coating on plastic which starts to come off after 3 months (in my case).as you can see in the picture.keys are decent, will get the job done.# My opinion: not worth it, I would recommend investing a bit more and buy real gaming keyboards like Logitech or Razer with or without RGB"
1,"If you type a lot, this is possibly the worst keyboard you can buy. The keys on the top row are at a height of 2 inches. This makes typing so so difficult that I cannot describe it. Additionally, the keys are small and placed too far apart so you end up making more typos than usual. The keyboard is very high so you constantly keep making hanging indents in word and opening new tabs in Chrome etc. terrible typing experience. I wonder how this keyboard got a 4+ star rating.Lighting: excellentKeys:: goodheight:: awful"
1,"While the lighting is good, please remember that the primary purpose of a keyboard is to be used as an input device. And this product fails spectacularly. Within 4 months of purchase, as many as 7 keys have become unresponsive. Contrast it with my Microsoft keyboard. It ran 5 years without a single problem.Left to myself I will never buy this product again. This is not a gaming keyboard. This is not even a normal keyboard. Even a 250 rupee keyboard lasts longer than this.Purchase decision: Watch and DON'T BUY."
4,"You can't change the light color. You can however change the lighting mode and brightness. The key press travel is enough for typing enthusiasts. The key face is smaller than expected and mis types happen, but when you get used to it in an hour or so, your hand tends to glide right. I have huge hands. Love the typing experience overall, lighting quality is amazing, but I would've liked a single color option too. Rainbow is a bit too loud for my taste. The key board is quite raised, you may need a wrist support for smaller hands. For gaming it is quite good. Cable is long enough to reach my CPU below the desk."

5,"Now as many others said earlier that this is not a mechanical keyboard, its true, its semi-mechanical. Its tactile feel is good through, with decent enough feedback and still gives that click mechanical sound, even though its not up to that level of performance. I mean come on, Mechanical Keys are the best and you pay for it. But for those who are not into mechanical keyboards but still want its performance to certain extent while gaming, this is a good solution. And for those who say this is not good for gaming, well its their opinion. For me its more than just being decent and I have no complaints on its performance. On the build quality side, there is nothing left to desire much, but its definitely neither too heavy nor too light."
4,"Build quality is just okay not that greatButtons are just okay not that clicky, they are kinda mushy at the lower end.Because of the shape of keys the accuracy is reduced a bitI got it for 799 so for me its for for what I paid.One thing to note, the HP logo only glows when scroll lock is on, don't know it's a problem with my unit or with everyone."
1,"I order HP K500f keyboard but when I received my keyboard I noticed that my keys are different then shown in the pictures and then keys also doesn't have the roundness as shown in pictures so I did some research and I found most of the people who order HP KM300F combo of keyboard and mouse get this keyboard and not as shown in the picture, in KM300F pictures also the keyboard has different fonts on keys and has roundness but still they send keyboard with flat keys and different fonts."
4,"If you work at late nights, this keyboard is best for you. All keys are transparent so light coming through keyboard letters. I am not a pro gamer so I don't know about gaming purpose. You can even control volume/mute by using FN+Function keys.You can increase or decrease brightness hitting FN+PGDN key multiple times and viceversa.Only con is Keyboard doesn't have fixed colour. There is no dedicated keys for Volume up, down and mute."
5,"I love the keyboard's feel - the keys press very smoothly, and the added light is a plus if I’m working an early morning or late night. I was looking on the keyboard market that lights up so I can see in the dark while typing/gaming. This is exactly what I was looking for, and it is bright. You can turn the lights off and even change the brightness depending on what your preferences are. I turn it to full bright, and it adds some style to my desk."
3,"i like the look and feel of the keyboard. didn't buy this just for gaming.the weight is good enough to make if feel sturdy.the backlighting is subtle and doesn't feel cheap. RGB looks good even when you are not using it for gaming.its worth the money. key travel is just enough. (very less typing sound which i prefer)BUT, i saw that the keyboard box seal was already open (torn) when opened the amazon package.this makes me wonder if they sold me a refurbished unit??as of now the keyboard is fully functional and has no issues. i would have given it 4 or even 5 stars. the only thing stopping me from doing so is that pre opened keyboard box seal. Surprised to see, a seller like Appario retail gave me an open keyboard box where the seal has been tampered with."
3,Good product. Build quality is very good. LED lighting works as expected.Used only for personal and office(2 months/Jan/2021). Not used for gaming yet.Keyboard sound is reasonable(All keys except space bar). Only space bar key has 2-3 connected spring and makes spring noise(As if some oil need to be applied to it). Need to figure-out customer support process and get help to fix this. It is slightly uncomfy with space key as it is the most used key!

4,"Well, what to say about this keyboard as it seems to be one of the best in this price range. It doesn't have mechanical switches but can't expect it for this price lol. It's a full-sized keyboard with membrane switches that feels nice like pressing mechanical switches. It has rainbow color LEDs with 3 lighting effects and feels premium for the price. One thing I liked which can be a pro or con for people is that the letters are not painted on switches like every other keyboard, infact it's translucent which means that letters got the design from inside the switch. So there's no chance of fading. Lighting is good and doesn't hit your eyes but num lock light might hit you depending on the angle. Overall it's a good product if one can get this under 1100 then it's a good buy and below 1000 (somehow) then just don't look anywhere else."
4,Overall experience with the keyboard is satisfactory for a person who uses a laptop keyboard all the time.The keycaps are too high and keyboard itself is high which makes it difficult to reach the function keys.The 'fn' key is placed to the right side of space bar which makes it difficult when we use left most function keys [these keys are mostly used for media controls].The cable is not braided which is a minus.Excluding these reason everything works fine and for typing it is good. The keyboard has aluminium top with plastic back which is great for this price range.
5,I feel just amazing . its quality is superb as this range. I suggest that you can buy without any doubt.What I like:1) keyboard button 🔘 feel2) keyboard key button view quality both in day and night3) trusted brand4) premium feeling5) easy to clean6) rgb color qualityDislike :1) Cost2) no color options for keyboard body
2,"You'd think how bad can a cheaper keyboard be. You just need a simple keyboard with lights. But apparently there is no minimum standard for low cost stuff any more.Many reviews here speak of the lights and the unreadability. Its also the terribke choice of font that makes it so hard to read. And not only is it a bad font, it also printed badly, giving it that extra cheap skate look. The home key doesn't even look like home, same as many others.In usability, it is just alright, the bare minimum that one could expect in a keyboard."
4,If you are writing on a flat surface then this keyboard is too heighted and bad for your wrists. Use a book or something as a cushion for your wrists for better results. Mushy keys but it's the best we can expect at this price. You can hardly see what's written on keys without backlight. Best features are windows lock and anti ghosting keys. Works really well.For usability 2/5For keys 4.5/5For Design 5/5For price 6/5Try better options but this ain't bad either :)
4,"The lighting feels dull. I don't think it should be called a gaming keyboard. To decrease brightness press fn+page down. I wish to see this keyboard with white backlight instead of funky three color combination. Overall it feels like typing in typewriter because the button height is huge. overall mixed feelings, I guess one needs some time to getting used to."
1,"I had ordered the keyboard which looks nice , but the ‘@‘ key is not working properly. When u press it a “ inverted comma appears. It is a 2nd replacement I guess the whole lot is defective and it should be removed."
4,"For those who think of buying let me be Honest with this. I bought it mainly for typing so there is no issue with the light intensity, it is perfectly comfortable for our eyes and the keyboard is smooth to use, there is a tiny slope in each key which is a good thing. After all it's hp products and for some, the product may be damage it's okay cause it happen sometimes. Return and replace that's the option you got only if you recieved damage products. And i didn't give any rating for gameing since... you know what i mean!! Thank you!!  :) If you appreciate the review do give a thumps up!!"
5,"Buttery Smooth, decent lighting. Bought after lot of research. Mainly bought for using in the night. Video Editing purpose. Very nice quality and serves the purpose. You may find cheaper options but trust HP make/manufacturing. Sturdy and Reliable, not harmful to the eyes in dark. Just perfect"
3,"It looks and feels good to use but there is a problem which made me dislike the product.It is advertised as an anti-ghosting gaming keyboard but there are a few annoying dead combinations like a/s/d+w+h doesn't work, w+shift+h doesn't work, a+s+o also doesn't work.This won't affect me anyway in normal daily use but when gaming it becomes a problem as some of these dead combinations are widely used in both fps and fighter games."
5,"Keys are soft and don't require too much effort to press. Keys are quiet too, no clack-clacks. Keyboard itself is wide and not cramped. Has a full separate number pad and full sized backspace key as well which are all very important for daily usage. A total steal at this price"
5,I started using Zebronics Zeb-Glide wired keyboard and realy impressed with this brand.The keys are soft and multifunctional purpose helps to toggle and provides asier user access.It has multimedia shortcut keys as well to provide immense experience during binge watching.Good design and product quality with durable wired USB.Must recommend for smooth user experience.Worth every penny!
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better
5,"There isn't much of travel in the keys thus won't recommend for gaming, but it's good at everything else. Recommend to buy. Value for money."
5,"I came across this keyboard at my friends house and found it to be very elegant and beautiful in appearance, easy to type on. In particular, the tactile responsiveness is perfect in giving a firm lightness to typing. Destined to be a classic."
5,I really like this keyboard. Keyboard is very light weighted and working very smoothly. I recommend this product. Customers can just go for this product. I am really satisfied with it. Thank u
5,Thought to save my lappy keyboard as kids are playing games on the laptop. This keyboard came as a savior and I would say this is really good keyboard and keys are really soft while typing.
5,"Exactly what I wanted. Works smoothly. The keys are smooth to the touch. These are a bit small, but that's OK. Overall, worth the price, value for money."
5,Good for theprice
5,"This keyboard is awesome!I wanted a keyboard that had “low-travel” and smooth keys.This keyboard has it all. The keys take less pressure to press it which makes up for a comfortable typing experience. Also, it looks pretty sweet in this white color!All in all it’s a great keyboard and I don’t think you’ll find a better option at this price. 10/10 recommended."
5,"This is the best Keyboard for Typing. Being a Content Writer, I use to do typing for more than 6 hours a day and this Zebronics Keyboard is the best companion for me. This is the best keyboard for Stenographers at this price. Really worth it."
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
5,Am 1sttime purchase electronics products from Amazon.. I am really happyfor value for money and comfort and softness keyboard.. also sealpack product received ... Original Zebronics keyboard .
5,"As always Zeb products, great one with great performance, regular use, coding, heavy use, fine for allMust buy product"
1,"Disappointed that i took this product. ,Very small in size and does not match what you see in the pic. Keys are so closely placed and up/down arrows almost overlap with other keys, so much that you need practice yourself to use it without pressing another key."
5,Using it as external keyboard for work and kids online classes. Easily operatable with soft keys. Saves the keys on laptop's keyboard from rough usage by kids. I do not intend to use it for gaming.
5,I was looking for a keyboard whith soft keys and low key stroke noise. This keyboard is just the right one. Sleek and sturdy. Best wired keyboard at an amazing price.
5,"Superb and smooth keyboard, its worth the price I bought and is much better than my expectations. Thanks to Amazon and zebronics Computers for this amazing keyboard."
5,FULLY SATISFIED....DON'T READ NEGATIVE COMMENTS LIKE ME JUST GO FOR IT IF YOU NEED A KEYBOARD FOR YOUR PC/ LAPTOP
5,Ek number keyboard. Softkeys. Multimedia.
5,It's working satisfactory.
5,बहुत बढ़िया है ।कम पैसो में अच्छा कीबोर्ड है । टिकाऊ है । Zebronics का है तो कहना ही क्या ..!
4,"It's very good and little weight , smoother  over all its good"
5,"Just writing the review with the keyboard itself. The keys are smooth, I like the design of the keyboard, very ergonomic.I will update if I find any defects."
5,This silicone keyboard protector is of very good quality .. it fits perfectly on my laptop which is a 15.6 inch HP laptop .. it secures the keys well and doesn’t let any dust go into the keyboard .. it gets stuck on the laptop from all 4 ends thus closing all spaces so that no dust can enter .. I really loved it and I’m totally satisfied with this amazing product .. a value for money purchase for sure and would recommend it to all!!
5,The Lapster Universal Silicon cover is very good product for covering laptop keys.It is dustproof and tranperant.Its built quality is so good.It is very necessary product for laptop users. It is also best in price.Value for money product.
5,Good product to protect keys of keyboard.This product is so much good and it fits to my keyboard of laptop. Earlier I was using but that was not clear but its to much clear and easily see the keys of keyboard and product keep my keya clear like new and fresh and The  product price is also low than market.
1,1. Not transparent. cannot see the keyboard unless strong lighting.2. does not stick. Poor Adhesion. Keeps moving when typing3. There were scratches in the product i received4 bad packaging. it was folded on one side and a few wrinkles.
5,"I just received the product today and I was excited for the same. The silicon is soft and is perfect for my laptop. Extremely happy with the purchase. The keyboard is fully covered and the buttons are easy to use and easy to apply. Also it is worth the price, it is sturdy and it won't tear up. Trust me, go for this product, it's totally totally worth it."
1,"The packaging is horrible. The protector comes wrapped around a hard paper and the paper ink gets on the protector... The packaging is bad from the seller. And it doesn't stick properly on Acer Nitro 5, might work well for other laptops."
2,First of all it came with creases which stayed till this date. Secondly the material is not clear you can barely see the keyboard. And If I keep my keyboard a little bit levitated it slips down.Catches dust and gets dirty very quicky.
4,Good product... Adhesion could have been better...
5,"Good product to use with comfort. Typing is not even an issue since the adhesion is really well. For those who are saying the Adhesion go after sometime, it's because of dust particles, just wash it with water and it becomes new and perfect.Very Easy To Install"
1,"This size is not suitable for latest generation of 15.6"" laptops. Better measure your keyboard size and then go for suitable size. Adhesive not good, cover slips as you type on keyboard."
1,"It's not sticking to to the laptop board. When the laptop is tilted, it slides and falls off.Feels like complete waste of money."
5,Bought this for my kid's laptop. This Protecting sheet helps from water spills. We use it while attending online. Nice product 👌
1,Does not adhere to the laptop keyboard very well. Moves around a bit. There is a permanent crease on one side due to the nature of packing. If you type continuously for more than 5 minutes it will move out of place. Fees more like a plastic sheet than silicone. Very disappointed with the product.
5,"The keyboard protector is very easy to install, and gives all round protection. It's universal, so can be applied to all keyboard kinds, and looks quite durable. Happy with the product."
4,Good product quality ok valie for money if rs 100
5,Very good silicon sheet cover for the keyboard....I use it on my dell Inspiron laptop and the size is perfect
5,"Too good and very usefull thing for laptop, waterproofing, dustproof and antibacterial and it is easy to clean , high scalability, freely rub and pull, thermostable, prevention of accident scald and important one it does not effect typing and the keyboard  is visible clearly"
2,"I can only use it or put it on when the fan is off. There is no stickness. But can be used when you are closing the laptop, but very slippy."
1,It is not for laptop. Does not fit for Dell laptops. Product is also of not good quality.
4,"It is not sticking well but it's okay because it works better than many other. Good material, excellent transparency....what else do you need?"
4,Good
5,It won’t fit for HP 15.6 laps
1,didnt stick for even more than 12 hours to my laptop and had big hole  dont buy it absolute waste of money. you can get this in around 30rs from your local computer store then why buy this  waste which dont even stick or is durable enough to last long for 1 week
4,It is a great product for the price and is a universal keyboard protector for your laptops. It fits perfectly in my ho omen 15. Also the protector itself is washable and can be reused. It provides good grip in the keys and also is very comfortable while typing.
5,"Usually most budget brands import and re-brand products. This time with the ""firefly"" TKL keyboard, Cosmic byte they seem to have done it correct this time around.What you get for nearly 2,000 rupees :1. Solid TKL keyboard2. Clicky blue switches3. RGB for days4. Braided cableWhy should you get this?1. TKL design - Difficult to come by. Most of the budget boards are full size.2. 2K - 2.2k is a good price with 1 year warranty. Can't beat VFM.3. Individual addressable RGB for each key4. Standard ANSI layout (pet peeve) - Unlocks keycap customization options.Why should you skip ?1. If you have an unlimited budget, look somewhere else2. If you/the people you live with -  don't like clicky noises from your keyboard3. The key-caps might seem too cheap and gamery for some folksThings to look out in the long run -1. Software support - The potential of lighting profiles is not completely tapped. The default lighting profiles are very limited. CB should provide the lighting software.2. There is no manual provided with the product. This is a easy fix, hope they look into this when shipping it in the future.3. Otemu blues look like a good choice on paper, need to check how their lifespan and durability in the long run."

1,"1. Backlight switches off randomly2. No effect that allows a stable color without any added effects3. Keys really do not respond as expected (some do not register at all)4. Right now, while I am typing, the lights have gone offNo amount of <Fn>+<INS> helps. <Fn>+<DEL> does not set color5. New symptom - keys get stuck and you get a very agreeable ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" for example (possibly the keyboard sympathising with my predicament)"

2,"Okay, so, to put it into perspective, I am reviewing this keyboard after using it for a day, and I've compared this keyboard with another budget offering from Redragon: K582.Let's begin.The RGB -Its NOT 100% RGB, its more like 7-8 colors. Maybe 10 colors at max. The software is unable to get the full 16.8M RGB lights out of this keyboard. Even the Redragon keyboard faces this issue, but it still allows to set more colors than this keyboard. And Redragon Software is much better. But yes, the WHITE color of Firefly is much better than Redragon's white.The Keycaps -Look cheap, feel cheap, ARE CHEAP. I was actually not bothered by the look of the keycaps untill I realized that the Laser etching is done sooo cheaply! The light was NOT coming out brightly from the Keycaps, and the letters made me feel like I need Glasses. Yes, I may be over-exaggerating, but I was comparing this to the Redragon K582, and it was simply not comparable in this department.The Switches -The switches of this keyboard are of BAD QUALITY. They may be durable for upto 50Mil presses, but the sound they make, its really flimsy and cheap. I really didn't expect a Blue switch to sound so bad. Also, a major point is that when I pressed certain keys, such as the Space Bar, I could hear a Sharp Spring sound, which is again, a place where Cosmic Byte has cheaped out. That spring sound was really annoying, and really felt like I am pressing a key unnaturally. The Redragon keyboard had Red Switches, so I cannot compare Red vs Blue here, but atleast it didn't make that cheap, Sharp Spring sound.Build Quality -Redragon has better build quality, but Cosmic Byte is not that far behind. It has decent quality. Almost comparable. If Redragon is an 7.5/10, this Firefly is like a 6.5-7/10.Overall - Okay, so this keyboard looks and feels cheap when compared to a Redragon Keyboard, but then again, Redragon keyboards are much costlier than Cosmic Bytes(50-100% costlier). So if you want a better keyboard and have a budget of about 4000, go for Redragon K582/552.But if your Budget is strict, well, there really is nothing that you can do, right? Firefly is your choice.If this is your first ever RGB Mechanical keyboard, then you won't even notice any shortcomings that I have mentioned above, since the keyboard is quite good overall.But since I am reviewing this while comparing it to a better keyboard, I just cannot ignore all the things that could have been better.Hope I helped you :)"
1,"Guys listen to me if you’re planning to buy this keyboard plz don’t. Im giving you my honest review that this keyboard is not worth the penny you’re paying for. I bought this keyboard to play warzone and many AAA games after a few weeks of usage some of the keys stopped responding which ruined my gaming experience. I contacted the company but no one picked up idk why , don’t buy this keyboard go for some other keyboard which might be a little bit expensive but go for it maybe corsair or hyperx"
4,I recently purchased cosmic 05 titan and i had to return it as the keys cudnt handle Modern Warefare wear and tear in 3 days. Looking for new and then i saw this one from same company and i decided to take risk. First thing is it has blue switches compared to 05 hence more responsive and better feel. RGB are good keyboard has good height without the clips also. Intensity of the RGB can be changed there are many effects. keyboard is of good quality as was 05 so no comments. Manual missing and my package was not sealed properly. So amazon should look into its lucknow centre. Package was open and no manual. WIll update after few more intense gaming session after COD Cold war Alpha.
5,"This is the Best Keyboard to ever exist...I literally got Rs.10,000 Cash in the box which is 5 time the price of the Keyboatd, i think i won a lottery/price or something but i got Free Money with it, and i returned the Keyboard to buy a Corsair Keyboard which was Rs.8,000 and i am thankful to this Keyboard that i now have a corsair one. Its a great purchase..."
4,"This keyboard offer much than expected from this price range. Keys are clicky as they have blue switches. We get braided cable not gold plated . It feels very good while typing. Its mechanical keyboard no membrane used .It’s best budget mechanical keyboard at this price point, i guess. Rgb is so damn good.After 6 months of usage :Keyboard is as good as new. No switch problems at all. I got a damaged product, the keyboard plastic at corner was broken. The packaging is worst. If your parcel falls from any one in delivering department can cause damage to it. As i got it damaged 😣But i managed to paste it with fevistick."
1,"""D"" Key died in just 3 weeks. Not for CSGO, software is bugy causes input lag delays."
4,"So this happened to bebmy first mechanical keyboard. I love how blue keys sound and I pretty satisfied with the sound of this keyboard. However, there's a ""clang"" sound from the metal upper, with each keypress. That is very annoying especially when typing. And the height adjusting feet feel cheap as they aren't of good quality.Other than these issues, everything else seems to be good. RGB is good. Doesn't have a per key RGB (maybe they'll add in the future with updates, no idea) but that's expected on a MKB for just 2k. The metal upper gives a sturdy feel to the board. Keycaps seem good too, with a matte finish on the sides too (glossy sides make the keycaps feel cheap). A lot of reviewers say the cable is very furable but I can't vouch for the same."

Value for money productCons1. U didn't receive sealed box2. Fit and finish need some improvement (plastic particles)3. Because of product Box is not Sealed ones u think it's a Refurbished Item4. U need to check every key carefully coz some people face some pblms with keys5. Space-bar stablizer is not good need some improvementUpdate After 1 month UsageMy keyboard working Perfectly no issue faced till nowOne more update after buying some other RGB peripherals i noticed this keyboard has Low RGB lighting then OtherMy Unit Working Perfectly I Did Not Face Any IssuePerfect one for meWatch UNBOX REWIND for Full ReviewConclusionIf u are new gamer just go for itIf u are on tight budget just go for itIf u want red switches under budget just go for it
5,Awesome clicks. Click sound is little high for my liking. Sturdy one. Eye catching led modes. Raised keys. Outemu Blue switches. Mechanical.
3,"The 'W' key which is used very often while gaming was not responding properly after just 1 month, and the customer support is so terrible that they are not responding to the complain i gave , They claim to resolve under 24 hrs but it has been about 3-4 days and yet no respond from them, All the other things like the build quality, RGB lighting is of good quality I found no fault in them but they key's quality is not up to the mark"
5,"Went through a hell lot of keyboard reviews, after getting totally confused about which cheap mechanical one to choose, i stumbled upon this. While i was a bit inclined towards Zebronics max plus, i still chose this. And that was the wisest decision. The build quality, the clickiness , the weight , absolutely delightful experience.It seems they have taken in all the feedbacks from their past products and came up with this.Must have product. Yeah i went through all the sound tests, bla bla, this is simply cherry mx like in all aspects. Definently a game changer."
2,"CTRL keyclicks are not registered all the time. Sometimes on the first click itself CTRL key works but sometimes it does not. I have to keep releasing the key and press it again until it works. This issue is seen just after 40 days of purchase. Currently I have raised the issue with the support team.There is a metallic twang whenever I hit any key with stabilizers (Like space bar, shift keys, enter key etc) which makes the keyboard feel cheap. Construction of the keyboard is really good for the price and RGB colors are excellent. Font is horrible.I do not particularly like the Red Key switches and the keys don't feel very good compared to my HyperX Alloy FPS pro keyboard (Cherry MX blue switches) for typing. So if you are a programmer or you are looking at this product to fit in your WFH setup (or someone who types more than games) take a look at the Blue key switch variant or go for Cherry MX blue switches and it'll be worth the extra money."

3,"It has been more than one month when I ordered this keyboard. After testing it for one month following pros and cons are highlighted by me.Pros -1) Upper Base is of metal and apart from that every thing is of plastic body. But considering price build quality is good.2) Per Key RGB with Software customisation -This is the main highlight of this keyboard due to which it is gaining high attention in the market. And from RGB's perspective this keyboard is really cool. So far as RGB brightness is concerned that is decent.And through it's software we can control its rgb effects, keys mapping and can set macros as well.3) Outemu Switches Quality -All Keys provide almost accurate response excepting spacebar key (Mentioned in first point of Cons).Cons -1) Spacebar Stuck issue -This is the main problem of this keyboard. During gaming or even typing, spacebar key gets stucked again and again.Couple of days ago company has also accepted publically that many of the users are facing this issue in this Keyboard. And I think this is the reason that now they have taken their stock back to fix the issue.I contacted to company's customer care team to provide me replacement but didn't get any response from them.2) Software is Buggy -Yes, the software is literally buggy and I also told in detail about this issue in my video. So for more information you can watch my unboxing and review video at Geeky Rishabh channel.If company successfully fixes the Spacebar issue then I can surely recommend this gaming keyboard at this time."
4,"Bought this Combo for ₹ 509 (product + delivery) on July 20, 2018The Product is same as it is shown in the picture.Pros :1. Colour Combination looks stunning.2. Keys are Soft and doesn't make awkward sound click sounds.3. Mouse works fine and the response is also good.4. The Additional Keys on the Left and Right hand side of the Keyboard enhances the look of the Keyboard and adds shortcuts to Useful Tools.5. The Keyboard is some what Water Resistant like it can handle water splashes and drain out water from tiny holes (present on the back side of the keyboard).Cons :1. The Wire Quality is not that Good, a Flat Cable look which is not that of a great quality as Dell, HP or Logitech provides.2. The Mrp is ₹ 619 and this Product even sell at a price between ₹ 645 - ₹ 950 which is totally not worth it.Conclusion :OVERALL A NICE FUNKY LOOK keyboard + mouse COMBO AT A DECENT PRICE RANGE (₹ 450 - ₹ 550)"
3,"Well it's actually a good combo for the price rate of 500.  But the mouse is not durable , on the first hour of use , the left mouse button stuck after double clicking ...,The keyboard on other hand is much better , the buttons are soft and silent , quality of keyboard is decent .....I m not going to order replacement (becoz of mouse problem ) ... As Amazon takes 1-2 months for exchanging this one with a new one , also there's a great chance that next time I will recieve a much worse product ...(from 2 times experience before ).... Also there was no packaging , the delivery boy just hand me the original box of this, no wrapping and Amazon packaging ...?"
5,Very Good quality product .
1,"After 6 months of useageProduct was packed well by amazon and it was delivered on time.Key board keys r smooth and noiseless. Mouse responsiveness is to the markAfter 3 months of useage, the key board is not working properly. When I contacted Amazon customer service, they asked me to contact the brand and provided me with a number. The number is invalid and when I called Amazon back they told me to ""Google"" the brand's customer care number and talk to them. It's good for 3 month useage. If you are ok with it please go ahead and buy it.It's better you buy some other product from a decent brand don't go for this one.Amazon service is worst in this regard."
5,"Keyboard-I don't know about gaming but this is worth every penny. I was hesitant about its shape at first because it looked too over the top to me but I like it now. It's light weight and silent. It doesn't make the 'tk tk tk' sound when you type.Mouse -The mouse is good and nothing fancy, which is great. I hate fancy mice so this works for me. It makes a little sound when you click but it doesn't bother me much.Installation speed -I tried the keyboard and mouse on both a slow and a fast laptop to check the installation time taken by the products. If you have a laptop in a decent working condition, it would start working immediately after it is connected. But for slow laptops, you might have to wait for a minute or two. But I feel that's because of the laptop and not otherwise.Registration -It comes with one year warranty so you can register your product on their website and manage everything online. I loved that."
1,"Very poor quality. the USB connector was loose and the computer would keep telling me 'no keyboard detected'. The keys are hard are NOT ALL ALL smooth for typing. Within a few hours of use the keys started to stick and the keyboard froze, becoming completely unusable. My mistake was throwing away the packaging so i am stuck with this completely useless product without any option to exchange it."
2,"I should say this keyboard probably is worth the price with the mouse combo. However this doesn't feel good on fingers. It is spongy, bouncy type feedback typical that you would get on budget membrane keyboard. You will get used to it. One problem is that small inverted Enter key is so awkward. I dont know why at all they do it. You will hit enter key when you didn't want to.EDIT:As of December 2019 (just short of an year), I'm buying a new set paying a little bit more, maybe Logitech. Reason is that the mouse scroll wheel has 'worn out'. It's wheel don't even engage the encoder (it's been a while since it's this way - so it didn't literally last a whole year), I opened up the mouse and saw how flimsy the whole thing is put together."
4,Not highly recommend for gaming but for office work it good choice & value for money. The keyboard have multimedia shortcut keys
1,"Edit:Reduced the rating to 1 star due to following reason:Worked for about 12-13 days. And just as the return window expired, the product started developing problems. Some keys on keyboard appeared to be stuck for example character ""c"", ""m"", return key and few more just did not respond. After unplugging and plugging again, found that keys are working but now these keys were working over time. Feather touch these problem keys and the key strokes resulted in ""ccccc"", ""mmmmm"" etc. Tried multiple USB ports, re-installing driver, changing the keyboard ""repetition"" settings but in vain. Now I can't return the product also since the window has expired.The mouse still works but I don't trust the quality of it."
5,"I have now been using the combo set for close to a month. Initially, I opted for it because I found it cheap compared to the combo sets I have acquired and just did not want to spend much. I didn't expect the set to last long. But I have been extremely pleased to find that the set works better, and in some cases, much better, than the three or four Logitech sets accumulated by me which have this or that component not working properly. The keys of the keyboard are different in style to the Dell keyboard I have but equally good to use. The Dell is softer but much more expensive. I have kept a record of the Amkette set for future ref should I need to buy a set again. Great value for money."
4,"While the look and the extra shortcut keys at both end are great features but when I use it for typing by keeping the keyboard on lap, it shakes a lot and looses balance.The keys are big and you need to press them deep. Another issue is with the noise of keys while typing. The keys makes noise even you shake it tilt the keyboard slightly.The wire used in both mouse and keyboard is not rounded and smooth. In fact it is neither flat too. Hence it feels pretty itchy when rubbed over your skin.Good point is it is cheap and light weight.Using it since 1 month and so far no issues .The Rupees symbol drivers are not found, hence as of now that feature is useless"
5,"The build quality is good. For normal works,  it is just excellent.... For those who usually do rough typing or faster typing,  I would suggest them to go for Dell and Hp keyboard because I have personally used them and still using it. The delivery was fast. The combo is just fabulous at this price range... With budget between 500-700, u can just go for it. It a value for money product.."
4,"If you want a budget combo, you can definitely go for this one.Pros:* Cheaper price* Keyboard has as multi-media keys* Cool orange colour for arroys, WASD and media keys in keyboard.* Keyboard is compact and has a good feel for typing and amateur gaming experience.* Mouse is accurate and very responsive, you may feel a little bit slow in FPS games due to it's little bit low DPI.Cons:* The markings on the keycap erases after 3-4 months usage on heavy use, else I would have given 5 stars."
1,"I didn't play any games on it for 6 months after I purchased it. Infact I barely used my PC for those 6 months. As soon as I started playing PC games under 15 days the buttons wore off and stopped functioning properly.If you just want a cheap keyboard of light work, then it might hold up for a year or so. But definitely not recommended for gaming."
1,Update : Don't  buy it..Key stopped working in the 10th day of use.I have Bought this keyboard Just today.  Shall surely share an updated Review After 1 month of use.But Right now.I would like to tell you my Observation.Pro:1. Budget Friendly combo between 500 to 600 Rs.2. Nice Poppy Color looks great to eyes.3. Soft Keys make less noise when you use them.4. Finishing is Descent for the priceCons :1. The Text on the Button looks printed and Not very Attractive and Clear. Hope it doesn't come out.2. The key travel is too long.  If you dont like keyboard with long Key travel you may not enjoy the typing experience.To summarize it a good Keyboard for a Small Budget.
4,"---I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017)Its been 1 and a half years now I'm using this product.Honestly, it is not a gaming mouse and keyboard combo...its the same as normal Mouse&Keyboard. the keyboard might give you a feel likewise but not the mouseFeatures:>Worth it under 500rs (I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017))>Good build quality of keyboard and about the mouse you cant use it roughly.>my Keyboard isn't working anymore from last month. stops working automatically (Nov19).>mouse still working good.why should buy>at this price surely this is a good choice.why should not buy>If you want a real gaming keyboard and mouseUpdate: 18Nov2019 keyboard is not working suddenly, no kind of damage happens"
2,"Hello,I got keyboard and mouse combo, and felt its good, but when i connected mouse what i found was its not functioning well and it stops in between.  Seriously felt bad to purchased it from online as if it would have been from shop, i would have immediately got replacement for it, but I got stuck here, can you please replace the mouse for me please.RegardsNimesh."
5,"Keys are smooth,Design is fantastic.One extra star for all over the look.This keyboard is even better than Dell .Mouse is not that great but it is accpetable in its price & i think it is great deal in the price.NO issue at all after few months if usage."
5,I have ordered it for my son ..Excellent product ..laptop keyboard will make kids to see screen from short distance thus i ordered it.. It is really awesome.. you have one year warrenty hassle free you ca register it from amkette.com.It may not be suitable for gaming No RGB . But looks premium.Over all Thanks to amazon for recommending this order.. Amazon always ahead..
3,"Keyboard looks decent, about 3 months of usage works fine.It is not a gaming keyboard, so NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.The shortcut orange keys are made of rubber and good to navigate quickly.Can be used for laptop's extra keyboard or a secondary keyboard.Mouse looks decent as well wire quality is normal and sufficient length.Again NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.OVERALL its Average and can be used as a secondary Keyboard and Mouse"
4,"At this price its not a bad deal.  The keyboard is really good. Keys are responsive and quiet. The shortcut keys on left and right are a nice touch. They work without any additional driver s/w being needed but if you are touch typist they might put you off a bit....the alignment of the hands are slightly altered due to the left side keys.  the mouse is slightly small. the wheel is badly placed. if you use the mouse wheel a lot to scroll through web sited you will get wrist pain soon. to summarize the keyboard is good. the mouse, while not bad is slightly smaller and the scroll wheel placement is a pain"
5,"1.Decent product to buy within budget!!!2.Good for gaming3.Give feel of type writer but key strokes are on softer side while typingBeing an IT professional, computer related gadgets has to be best of use .It's of every day use for me and works really good"
5,"And the Amkette legacy continues. I love this product. Amazingly superb. Even the USB connector, the wires, the keys and the look... You won't believe, till you use it. Please see the photos of every parts, I have shared here. Thank you Amazon for another Amazing product from Amkette."
4,The keys have a nice long travel and feels sturdy. Have been using for 03 months now and completely satisfied with the product. The highlights on the keyboard look good. Quick access keys on the sides of the keyboard are a good addition to the keyboard. Overall the best budget keyboard and mouse combo available out there. Would recommend buying it.
4,"On a whole, for this price range the product was really good for office use and for gaming also it was some what better with no noise of typing and sturdy keyboard.The mouse was quite responsive with decent look.Only defect is the packaging it didnt came with the amazon packing, just a box like it came as you can see in the last picture, it was somewhat damaged outside the box so i was scared about the product but it was all fine inside as u can see the pics posted.Overall this product was good in this price range."
4,I happen to use this for my regular use and not for gaming. The keys are soft and the benefit is the multiple short cut keys that are available on the keyboard which are really working.I can not vouch for the gaming though.
4,"Perfect combo for the price. Initially I was skeptical while buying this for the quality as most of the combo available for this price are of worst quality and don't last more than 3-4 months. After using I find this to be perfect for regular/office use. If you are looking for a office keyboard/mouse combo this should be the one you can depend upon.PS: For Amazon, this is not for gaming and being a USB combo I don't think you should look for battery life."
4,"First of all I already own an Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard and I have been using it for a year without any issues, so I knew my new purchase also would not disappoint me. I bought new Amkette keyboard mouse combo for Rs 427 at Amazon Grand Shopping Festival for my sister and she already loves it. The only con with this keyboard is it cannot be used for gaming, as still the UV coated keys fade away if you use for gaming."
5,So simple...but I think it's not a feather touch......When I received this package the box of the product I teared I think it happens at the time of packaging but product is perfect no complaintsAnd this combo pack is value for moneyAfter delivered this package I know about amkette's other combo pack valued of RS599/- it is more beautiful with blue colours and it's shortcut keys are on the above........Overall rating is very good
4,"Initially i got a faulty keyboard with the ""Enter"" key getting pressed with a feather touch which made typing impossible. Then got it replaced the next day.Post that everything has been fine with the keyboard.Mouse also works great.Good product."
1,"Horrible product, hardly 2 weeks I used and the escape and space buttons are inactive. Tried reinstalling the drivers, fixed sticky keys also.. guess the product is only not good"
5,"Well packed and awesome multimedia key u can acess calculator , my computer and mute with just simple touch.Nice key operation Thanks to Amezoe and Seller for great product with more than excellent packing for product safety. Go for it blindly"
1,"Don't buy this product .It's made in china, Also it feels cheap plastic used .uncomfortable for typing .should have priced 200 inr"
1,It's not even an year and the number keys which are above alphabets stopped working. I have barely used the keyboard. I haven't used it more than 20 times in a year. It's not possible for me to go to a nearby city in this period of covid to claim the warranty.
5,I was recently looking for a keyboard and after looking at few I found this one this product had the most  excellent design I had ever seen so I ordered it. After a few months of using it I can assure you this is the most ergonomic keyboard with clicks which are Satisfactory compared to a gaming keyboard I would recommend people who can't buy expensive keyboard to look for this.
5,"Nice designed keyboard with colorful buttons of Volume control and play control, left-right directions buttons and the keys are not making much noise.  I love the keyboard.  Also, the mouse is just as good as the keyboard."
4,"it is a good quality keyboard. The good thing is that keys do not make noise while typing.This keyboard has adequate space between the keys and the peripherals have some important keys like email, audio keys and more.Overall a good quality keyboard and mouse combination, look-wise also it is nice , easy to use."
1,The numpad on the right side of this keyboard is not working.  Not sure if any special keys to be used before I use the numpad. Tried options but nothing much on internet.My bad luck is that I haven't checked it till after one month of delivery date.
1,"After a month, the keys started malfunctioning. If you are typing something, sometimes the app gets closed, sometimes Google Chrome opens up, sometime mail box opens up. My son had to leave his class as when he was doing live worksheets, some random key while typing changed the current address (online class) to the home address (Google search). Don't go with the looks, it's the worst keyboard I have ever seen. Never seen such issues even when there was windows 95."
1,In my last post I mentioned about the keyboard not working. Now when I try to contact customer support- the number is not in service. Tried multiple other numbers but nothing works. How to get the warranty for the product when they is no support from the product company.
2,"KEYBOARDPros----1. Metal top and thick plastic base makes it very strong and minimum deck flex.2. Raised keycaps and tactile membrane keys. IT'S NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD.3. Long braided cable with strong USB connector.4. Decent rubber pads to stop slipping on the desk.5. Windows lock and RGB light brightness control buttons.6. Interchangeable WASD and Arrow Keys.Cons----1. Input gets stuck sometimes even if the keys are not stuck. Happens about 4 times in 24 hours on average.2. Sometimes input is not registered.3. Keys are not equally tactile. Space bar takes a lot of effort.4. Only 3 light colour combination, no effects. Forget about software synchronisation.5. It's NOT TRULY BACKLIT, key labels are not visible by the light, only the key gaps are lit.6. Packaging is bad.MOUSEPros----1. Ergonomic and grippy design, easy to hold for medium and large hands.2. Metal base allows smooth movement and weight to the mouse.3. 6 buttons - Left/Right/Scroll/DPI/Forward/Backward4. 4 DPI settings 1000/1600/2400/3200 through cycling.5. Long braided cable with stroNg USB connector.Cons----1. Sometimes input is not registered.2. Metal base is not removable if you prefer light mouse.3. Only RGB breathing effect, nothing else.4. Forget about any other features at this price with RGB.I bought this about a month ago and it's running good. The build quality is very strong, you can kill a person with the keyboard. The packaging is very bad, resulting in a lot of people getting damaged products.Even though there's issues with inputs for both the mouse and keyboard, it never happened during my daily 4 hour gaming binge. However, I don't recommend this for intense FPS gaming as it can be difficult to hold the mouse for very fast movements for a long time.The RGB is okay but the money could have been used for adding other features or making the existing ones better, or at least they could've made the key-labels visible by the light. I do not recommend buying this at Rs.1600 as there are other better alternatives available at that price or a little more, like the Cooler Master keyboard-mouse combo. Buy this if you get a sale where the price is closer to Rs.1000.Edit: As of 02/02/2020, the '1' and 'Z' keys from the alpha-numeric set have stopped working. I have reduced the ratings as the problems mentioned above have increased and new problem has come up. The mouse works fine, but if clicked too hard, next click won't register. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying at more than half the price, save more money and buy other better options."
5,"Okay, so I got this combo today. The packaging was a bit bad. The box was deformed at some point, but the keyboard and mouse were in excellent condition.Talking about the product, the build quality is awesome. The breathing LEDs are a charm. The mouse is way too smooth. The keyboard keys don't wobble and give somewhat a mechanical feel.In short, the headline is 100% right. Just go for it !"
5,"I was a bit skeptic at first when this was on offer for 1200rs, as i don't usually trust reviews here. but must say this one blew my expectations and i have a new found respect for reviewers too.The quality of the keyboard and the mouse is very good better than good i must say.The LED features could have been more elaborate well any ways u can turn them off on both the devices.(On the mouse long press the Dpi button to turn off the LED). ps-found it the hard way.STURDY, BEAUTIFUL AND VALUE FOR UR EVERY PENNY."
4,"This really a worth deal for 1150 which I got this pair of keyboard and mouse for . So now first of all I received this package 1 day after the estimated day the packaging was really bad and was making some noises then I found that there were two screws which were unscrewed in the process of shipping or something . The ergonomics of mouse is really good it just fits perfectly in my hands the buttons on the mouse pretty good but two side buttons are really clumsy to click I have accidentally the button I don't want to click like 1/5 times the keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling the wires are really good they are braided and have gold plating on the male usb end ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of individual key but you can try few zone lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights"
2,"While using in a room full of light this keyboard is value for money;However when you use it in a dark room, you cannot see what you are typing unless you are pretty used to typing without seeing.The keys are not backlit, the RGB lights are there but you still cannot see anything on the keyboard in a dark room."
4,The product is very good ..... Elite keyboard under fair price .....But the MRP isn't 2599... But it is 1599 (as shown behind the box).
5,Amazing build qualityAluminum build qualitySwitches are tactile and nice and solid feelMouse dpi is amazing very fast response rate for games like csgo and fortnite
5,"If your in a budget, you will really appreciate this combo.. This is one of the best that you can get.. If you can find it around or less than 1200, buy it in local shop. Bcuz, amazon ships this product is an extremely bad shape. Ive bought 3 of these in the past 2 to 3 years. 1 from local which was good. And 2 from amazon which was damaged a bit. Since there was a local service center I was able to get it replaced. If u dnt get a damaged one, then you'll definitely love this. Some pros and cons after using for 2 years.Pros:Stylish metallic lookKeys and mouse buttons are really durableAlthough it's membrane, key press is really smooth and silent.Mouse bottons are smooth and thumb buttons are easy to reach and would be grt while gaming.Sensors are very decent and will be perfectly fine unless you are a professional gamer.Keyboard has 3 adjustable height.If you feel the mouse to be heavy, you can remove the side and bottom plates but it'll void warranty.Cons:Scroll wheel will definitely fail at one point but this was not an issue for me as this can be fixed easily. Checkout YouTube for this.The rgb lights are pointless. Lights are behind the keys and keys doesn't allow light through them so you can't see the keys in a dark room.The package always arrives in a damaged state. So you gotta be lucky to get an undamaged piece.There's no software so mouse will always have a breathing light effect and keyboard has 2 to 3 modes which can't be modified. But this can't be considered a con for a product at this price and I always keep the lights off.Apart from these minor cons, the functionality and performance of this product is outstanding."
1,Ofcourse it looks well lit but the performance is poor. I got this product and after 2 weeks the scroll key in mouse started malfunctioning. After a month the keyboard started malfunctioning. If you consider budget wise you can buy this... But if you want to use it for a prolonged period of time then this product is not suited for you. Just after a month buying this product now I'm gonna have to buy a new keyboard and mouse.Not Satisfied with this product!
3,"I was wondering that it will be good thing to work during dark or night without disturbing others but it doesn't show up the keys, during dark and make difficult to identify the keys, lights glow below the keys and keys not made transparent so that it also glow. I later purchased other keyboard to solve my issue, I didn't return this because my son liked it due to changing light patterns and he use the desktop to play games or drawing."
1,Got in two days after ordering.. packaging was worst ever.. keyboard was damaged from outside.. slight 4 bends on body and a lot of scratches on back.. came in wet condition.. didn’t applied for replacement because it was working fine and also think that i was waste of time as it takes week to exchange.. be carefull although the product is goof..Edit: after giving one star.. it stops taking image in review..
1,"Why people are giving positive reviews to this mouse. Durability is good but problem is with the comfort and sensor. Normal mouse is better than this.This is not for gaming, It has a high lift off distance which is very much annoying while gaming. After 30mins of gaming my wrist hurts, so comfort is very bad.It is a very bad choice for gamers.I bought g402 instead of this."
5,"The mouse some times doesn't connect for 1 sec but is fine later (happens rarely but it does) isn't a big problem. Also, the mouse is really good cause my last mouse scratched my laptop's surface and the second I put it on my laptop it slid so smoothly. I recommend you buy this for a Laptop or a PC. The cable is long enough so that if my laptop is connected with HDMI to my TV I could still put my back by the bed and play normally(really helpful).The Keyboard has good lights too and is comfortable even when put on laps. It took some days but I got used to typing on this keyboard (as am a fast typer that was awfully quick for me. though it could have been better though that would increase the price a lot."
5,"I purchased this for 1100. Yeah was a steal at the price! Coming to the product, the build quality is top notch and this certainly doesn't feels like a super budget set. Just hold it on your hands and you'll know what I'm trying to say. Aluminium used and it looks so freaking good!The mouse does the job well too and the extra buttons can be easily maped. I use this in competitive FPS like Apex Legends, CS GO, PUBG etc and this comes in real handy. However note it'll take time for you to get used to it. It's a bit heavy to use but once you're used to it, there's no issue.A few things I didn't like were that LEDs weren't lit in the keys but just the gaps. I mean it still looks great but if you wanna use it in the dark, you wouldn't be able to see. Also the space bar takes a lil effort. The mouse is perfect and there's nothing to crib about there.However the packaging was just ""BAD"". Please look after it AMAZON.  I don't know why they did it but I just got the keyboard box without any wrapping or protection. ( It was a bit damaged from the the sideS too, Thank God the components were safe xD ).Nonetheless, it's a steal for 1100 or even 1200-1300. Full 5 stars from my side considering the price."
5,THIS IS THE BEST KEYBOARD AND MOUSE I HAVE EVER SEEN PLAESE GO FOR IT AS IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN HAVE IN SO MUCH LESS PRICE IF IT WERE OF EVEN 5000 RUPEES THEN TOO I WONT BE SHOCKEDP.S - YOU DONT GET TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL KEYBOARD AND MOUSE QUALITY EVEN IN THE PHOTOS GIVEN BY AMAZON  OR ON THE REVIEWS IN THE YOUTUBE. WHEN YOU GET THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD THEN YOU GET TO KNOW THAT THE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PLEASE CONSIDER TO BUY
5,Damm It's Just Amazing.The quality Of the Product is Great in That price.Pro's ->Metal BoddyMechanical feelPremium LooksRGB / 4-5 ModsMouse feels Solid & HaveyWires Are Fully BridgetGold Plated USB2 Mod StandsMouse Works Very Good Even in Gaming time2 Extra Function key on MouseCons->Keys Not RemovableI would say For 1300/INRThis is What You should buyJust Buy it With Out wasting Any timeIt's better then even 2500/inr keyboards
5,"This is perfectly a premium gaming mouse. Very comfortable and sturdy build. If you play games for a long time you will absolutely have no complain, very comfortable to hold. The breathing LED lights make it more attractive and the two side buttons allows you a more powerful gaming.Thanks Amazon and Zebronics"
5,"I am not a gamer and haven't taken this for gaming purpose, I was looking for a top quality Keyboard Mouse Combo where I think Zebronics did a near perfect Job.I wasn't looking for anything else apart from a performance. This Keyboard does a decent job than ther Dell wireless & Logitech does. Keys are very well placed and ideal spacing of letters. Top notch quality of cables and length too which is very much required in wired devices.Mouse is also excellent and does a pretty good job. It certainly adds value to your Home Office. The back and forward button on the mouse is a very very useful feature.Rest all is gimick of that lights but it's not well crafted.. Truly Value for money."
5,"My kid specifically asked for this for gaming after seeing it at his friends' place. But given more school work/studies going online, it is a good full size keyboard for kid to minimize wrist fatigue. It is really good and in kid's words -- ""satisfying"" especially from mechanical type of feeling. Mouse is very cool too.  The smile on kid's face makes is a must buy for parents. Moreover it is an Indian brand so very proud of it too. It looks futuristic too from ""transformers theme"" styling perspective and subtle LED lighting. Quick delivery by Amazon despite lockdown etc. Big thank you and hi-five to Amazon and Zebronics."
5,"Its one of the best things i have purchased from amazon, build quality is nice, price is good, remember that its a milti light setting that means three diffrent color of light will be there on the keyboard at any particular time which is not that nice, in place of that if they would have gone with one color at a time thatw ould be nice other wise go for it"
5,About keyboardBest for gamingBest for typingWhile playing games you've to decrease your brightness otherwise you'll get RGB light's rays that will distract you too much...Increasing and decreasing brightness option i like it too muchThis is very affordable keyboard you can go for itAnd one more thing the keyboard body is that much powerful you can defend yourself while alien invasion..About mouseMouse has 2 LED lights inside its body and one of them is too annoying it's very eye catchy and annoyingYou can't increase and decrease the lights of the mouseThey should have given that option in mouse too but yeah don't worry about that too much because every person has different perspective i said mine but i believe me you can go for it..Apart from that mouse buttons are so cool while playing it's like you're in ufo and you're controlling it by the mouse.. actually it's button the quality itself is very different like matte finish and because of RGB lights you'll feel about that ufo stuff which I've said...Very good mouse and keyboardGo for it blindlyDon't waste your money in high price keyboard and mouseIt all work the sameAnd this one is very cool.
5,GAMING:- If you want gaming/Basic use/Heavy use Keyboard & Mouse .Just go for it. It has RGB colors. DURABALITY:-And much tough quality.Aluminium body. Dpi settings for mouse. For more info refer zebronics website. DISADVANTAGE:- You cannot see Alphabets & number on buttons in the night even if you on rgb lights. FEEDBACK:- Your selling product in india so recommend you guys to add rupee symbol
1,The product is supposed to work for at least 12 months. but stopped working after 4 months. Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer wanted to to visit their service center which is about 30 kilometers away on the other side of the city. It will cost me time and probably more money  than the product's price. overall appalling service from both.
1,The USB receiver is not working. It is under warranty. Dell refuses to service as they say warrranty is over as per their terms. I purchased it on 8th feb 2017 but dell says the warranty starts from date of manufacturing and not when the customer purchases the product.Can amazon please help me with this.
1,"Pros:1. Smooth surface2. Almost silent typing3. Ergonomic mouseCons: [Note, I got warranty replacement in 3 months and the replaced item has same issues as listed in the cons below, so they are standard lackings in the product]1. Battery Indicator never works - it is a mere gimmick2. Absence of the Indicators for Num Lock, Function Key Lock, Scroll Lock is more inconvenient than I thought. Makes case change typing really complicated. Very unpractical.3. Both original mouse and second mouse went nuts after few weeks of use. They become hard to click causing RSI condition for users.4. Keyboard batteries do not last beyond  2 months even on moderate use of 2-3 hours typing a day.5. Dell does not have straight forward customer service for peripherals which made customer service experience a nightmare during warranty replacements.Overall rating: Poor value for money"
5,"It was either this or the logitech keyboard and mouse combo. Good range, works fine upto 9 feet distance. The mouse is medium sized, feels good in the palm. Keyboard is full sized.Let's have an in-depth look at this product.Pros:1) Has chicklet keys which as far as I have seen none of the other keyboards in this price range has.2) Very comfortable while typing. The keys are well spaced and well built.3) The Bluetooth receiver,  which is plugged into the USB port is quite small and it works for both the mouse and keyboard.4) The keys when pressed are quite soft and has depth.5) Both keyboard and mouse are solidly built, good plastic and finishing6) Free Duracell alkaline batteries for both mouse and keyboard provided. (2 AAA + 1 AA)CONS:1) No Off switch for the keyboard.2) No caps lock led to indicate when caps is on.My verdict is definitely go for this if you want a keyboard and mouse combo. Best quality at this price range.Including pics for your advantage. Hope this review was helpful to you."
1,"This keyboard is BIG. And impacts my typing speed. I cant reach my speed of 85 WPM because of the extra big size of the keys and their alignment. The keys are not properly aligned.. they are stretched a few millimeters than the standard key board.Every time I use ALT function , i accidentally touch windows keys. This Keyboard is for HUGE people like Sir Gregor Clegane = The Mountain from Game of Thrones.Dont buy it if you are among the humans that can be classified under normal category.Very Disappointed. I doubt this is a original or Fake product. Is this actually from DELL, because other Dell keyboards are absolutely perfect for me :/"
1,"There is NO CAPS Lock LED Indicator... It creates a problem entering Password , you cannot know if it small or capital letter...  I found it a big disadvantage.. Other than that it works perfect"
3,"It is a great option, its Dell after all. The buts being the keys feel very mushy, they aren't as clicky as you would expect them to be. The placement of keys is a lil different, takes time getting used to; it is my second day with it and I still miss keys here and there. Specially cause there is a 'Fn' key on the left after 'Ctrl' which shifts 'Alt' key to the right more than anyone is used to; this makes me press windows key all the time. The keyboard has no indication for Caps Lock and Num Lock, makes sense they wanted to save battery; but it does get annoying while typing passwords!The mouse on the other hand is great! No complaints about it whatsoever. The mouse it self is very light, battery adds to its weight which is very adequate.You can't actually go wrong with this at this price point. But there is a lot of getting used to involved here!PS: I used an OTG with my phone and connected the dongle supplied, both mouse and keyboard worked just fine. So this is a super compatible device. There is no lag or latency in mouse or keyboard."
5,"Using it from last 2 months without turning off, almost happy with price I paid. Good battery life. Keyboard has a little lag when I type very fast. But the price is low, so cant expect more than this.Update: using it from past 8 months and the mouse is showing low battery for the first time. (Keyboard battery is still running) Really awesome product. I am 100% satisfied and recommend this to everyone. (Note: I never turned OFF the mouse during this period. It was always ON)"
1,"I bought this product during March-2020. I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. Within 3 months keyboard started giving problems. Function keys are not working (F10 & F11). I'm a techie and use these Function keys as shortcuts for my development work. Also the mouse seems to be a power hungry device. within 3 months ""Duracell ultra alkaline battery"" got emptied. I donno when both will stop working. I trusted Dell brand and Amazon, but both ditched me."
1,It was damaged & not in working condition. I have observed multiple time that Appario Seller has sent defective & non working products. This combo was also one of them.The product box was totally damaged. Cells for Mouse & Keyboard were opened up & seems like used. Keyboard was in working condition but mouse was not in working condition. I feel that it was the used product which was sent to me.I totally hate Appario Seller's this poor strategy.Same thing I bought from local market which is 70 Rs costlier than Amazon and it is fresh & awesome product.If anyone from Appario Team is reading this review then I suggest improve your service instead of sending fake & used products.
2,"Suddenly my keyboard has stopped working without any reason. Changed the battery, but still keyboard is not responding, looks like receiver had a very poor life. Really frustrating."
5,"For work purpose it's good and simply does the work. The USB connects to laptop and both mouse and keyboard works smoothly. You put one AA battery in mouse and two AAA batteries in keyboard. I tried to usethis wireless mousee with 5 feey distance, it was working fine. This is an affordable wireless keyboard and mouse combo.Found this review helpful? Hit helpful button."
5,"Delivery was fast. Received within a day even though estimate said later. Packaging was good. Contents were intact and there was no damage. Purchased it for Rs. 1281 from the amazon seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"". MRP on the box was Rs.1399. It was manufactured in China and imported for sale by Dell. Batteries are included in the box. I am happy to see Duracell batteries and not some local brand which might not last long. 2 AAA batteries for the keyboard. 1 AA battery for the mouse.My initial impressions are it does not give a premium look and feel. However its functional. Dimensions are little big for my taste. I would have liked them a bit smaller. Its a full keyboard with number pad and arrow keys. Function keys are also present with some additional multimedia keys. keyboard layout is in English. Mouse is little noisy when clicking and scrolling. Precision is good. I am used to Logitech mouse which is much quieter compared to Dell. At this price range it is a good deal. Tested all the keys to check for any manufacturing defects. Everything seems to be working fine. There is on-off button on the mouse but there is no such option for the keyboard. So I am not sure how long the batteries will last for the keyboard. Better to keep couple of AAA batteries handy just in case.Key press and travel is good. Distance between the keys is adequate. Keys are little hard to press at first but I am getting used to it. There is not much delay from key press to displaying text on the screen. Sometimes it is noticeable as I am used to wired keyboard.There are no LEDs on the keyboard for NUM lock and CAPS lock. There is one very small LED for indicating low battery.I did not check the wireless range yet. Box says it should work up to 10 meters. We get a single unified nano USB receiver for both keyboard and mouse in the box. Its small in size and will not protrude much outside the USB slot.  I did not face any issue with the connection on my Win10 laptop. No additional drivers needed. I was able to use both keyboard and mouse from the very instant the USB receiver was plugged-in.Verdict: I am happy with the performance of the Dell KM117 keyboard and mouse combo. I will definitely recommend it for people looking for good wireless keyboard and mouse combo with good performance within budget."
4,"I was worried at first because there wasn't enough protection when I received this item and the Dell box was compressed when I received. Thankfully everything is fine and came in one piece.To be precise: The keyboard is smooth and precise. Wireless and it's got the basics right. You can't go wrong here. Came with the batteries too.However, two important things missing here is that:1. there's no off/on switch for the keyboard. In one sense, it's convenient cause it's like a direct plug & use. But this could affect the battery duration somehow. In case if watching a movie on the laptop, I don't have the option to switch off the keyboard during that one hour gap. The mouse has an on/off switch.2. The wireless USB adapter doesn't have any option to be stored somewhere within the keyboard or mouse. If you lose it, then this whole keyboard/mouse will become useless.I hope Dell can think further into integrating these two options into their keyboards as well.Apart from these two hiccups, this is good keyboard."
1,"ConclusionThis is a good keyboard for people who generally use their computers for browsing and light typing. Not suitable for people who intend to type several pages a day as the ergonomics are not good. A mechanical keyboard is better in that case.ProsThe product seem well made and finishing is very good. The keys are fairly responsive and the mouse is very comfortable to useConsThis is not a mechanical keyboard and does not have the same level of responsiveness. Keys are close together, may cause errors. Keys require more pressure to ensure that the desired symbol is typed and causes more errors."
5,I am using this keyboard and mouse combo with my Macbook Air 10.13.6. i had to use an external keyboard as i extensively use Numeric pad for my work. and due to limited USB port i specifically wanted wireless keyboard and mouse. there is a single dongle for both keyboard and mouse. the pairing was a breeze and took me less than a minute. the mouse had reverse rolling on MacOs because of its inherent windows alignment. However it can be corrected in setting and its working without a problem. just two issues with Keyboard. it is not back lit and it has not light for Caps lock. other than these two issues i have no problem with this package. the key combination for MacOs will also get a day or two to get used to. After that its much simpler to use. would definitely recommend it.
4,"Keys are excellent. However, there are gaps through which dust can go in - which is NOT shown in the product images which show full keys that block dust or visibility to the insides. IF I cover with plastic, I cannot even feel the keys when typing - so a cover is useless. I am not sure if those silicon keyboard protection applies here or not - extra cost - have to seeThere is no Caps lock light or Num-Pad light. You'll have to figure out yourself. A minor nuisance especially if you are in a hurry to get work done. There is absolutely no lighting of any sort so IF you want to work in the dark - Impossible unless you're very used to the keyboard and even then it will be difficult.Wireless Is a Boon. Seeing the clutter of wires OFF my desk and the option to place the keyboard wherever I want to is a welcome addition after a long time. Typing especially is a delight. Love the Layout of the Product. Mouse is good - as expected, no major standouts there but it does its job and that is more than expected I guess. This is a purely office purpose keyboard, can be used for gaming sure but I would suggest get a proper gaming keyboard for that like Cosmic or any other that comes with customizable options and leave this one for office work alone, it will thrive.Finally - Amazon Product Page says the Keyboard was Made in India which is why I went for this product in the first but the product itself SHAMELESS advertises that its Made in China. I don't like Chinese products but if I can't help it, I'll buy it as they are imported by Indian Companies. But why falsely advertise? Yeah, I can return it, but I need it - hence the review, else wouldn't have bothered to do so."
1,"If you are a serious typer, then this keyboard is not for you.I use mechanical keyboard all the time, I had to buy a keyboard immediately so I choose this one. It was a very bad decision. I'm a software developer, Keyboard is a big part of my day to day job. This keyboard is causing nothing but pain for me. a lot of keypresses is not getting register. key are ver hard. I'm making a lot of typos due to this keyboard.I have tried other rubber dom keyboards as well but this one is very very bad"
1,Issues with the key. Many of the keys that you type don't get registered. So you have to be careful and see which letters in the word are missing. At times it's frustrating
2,"The name DELL sounded good enough to buy the product. Using it was never easy. I have lots of DELL products from USA but this is first time I am buying from DELL INDIA. Threw the keyboard out yesterday and got myself another one from logitech. The keys in DELL were not soft touch and when you are typing fast, at least 50% of the letters will not show up on the screen. I had to keep punching in (and not typing) so as to not miss any letter.Definitely not worth the price. If you are thinking to buy this, I wold say, think again. There are lot better products out there."
5,keys are very soft and mouse is perfect fits in handi got is 1100 and its very niceall full size keyboard keys are availablematerial is amzingand smooth feel while typingi recommended for all laptop users this keyboard
5,"This is my second pair of the same wireless keyboard and mouse. I really like it!The mouse fits perfectly in my large hands! It's not tiny like some other wireless setsThe battery life is amazing! The keyboard battery lasted longer the 6 months with daily usage! Even the mouse battery life is pretty decent.They both look premium and good quality products.The range is sufficient for slightly better than average distance.You can always buy a usb extender for that if required!Now for the bad thingsThe keys are a little hard to press. It takes a little time to get used to it. But they are comfortable. Good travel speed and once you get used to it, it starts feeling fasterOverall great product. Would surely recommend to anyone wanting a good quality keyboard and mouse!"
1,"The key operations on the board are not properly given most important think we can't identify the caps lock option is in ON or OFF state most disadvantage and @option which is not on the key of button with 2 number. It's is present near "" option as @ which is the worst think. Remaining is OK."
3,"I have multiple Dell products with me, including 3, 4 laptops we have at home and several mouse, keyboards, etc., which have been serving me well for a very long time now, hence obviously I had very high hopes when I placed an order for this KM117 model. The reviews here were overwhelming too, with 4.5 Stars, not sure if this product was better earlier, but have degraded quality in recent days, but honestly am not too excited looking at the whole product overall.Build quality has been compromised, I hear a lot of rattle, many keys are loosely fit making annoying noises especially the longer keys like Shift, Tab, Caps Lock, Enter, Backspace, etc. The space bar and Shift keys do not even register a click unless pressed at some specific points. Am used to engaging the left corner of spacebar using my left hand thumb, but in several occasions it went unregistered as a keystroke, which is literally annoying, apart from the irritating sound. Surprisingly, the spacebar has already developed a considerable levels of key play within the second day of usage itself, unsure of longevity. One other observation is about the printing on the keys, they seem too local, not sure if it would last long, also it gives a cheap overall look. Holistically a bit overpriced for the quality been delivered.Other than these gripes, things went smooth; Both the keyboard & mouse started working right after plugging in the the wireless adapter to the USB port of the machine. No hassle yet with mouse, working like charm. Would have been good to have a switch to turn On/ Off the keyboard also similar to the one we have on mouse.Too early to comment on battery life - But good thing is that they provided all 3 required batteries in the box."
4,"the quality, ease of use, the feel everything is really good. ONly one negative is that there is function key in between the Ctrl and Alt key which is kind of unconventional and makes using Alt+Tab key a little difficult to switch between windows. If you are used to using a normal key board, you need to stretch your thumb a little bit. May be over a period of time I will get used to it. Other than that this is a very good wireless keyboard and mouse and at about Rs. 1300/- this is a good deal. I wanted to buy logitech which was a about 1,000 Rs, but the logitech keyboard did not have the front clips to raise the front side of the keyboard for comfortable hand placement. This one has the front clips."
1,"This is one of the worst wireless keyboard and mouse combo I ever bought. The wireless connectivity is VERY BAD. Key strokes from the keyboard are often lagging and randomly duplicated. I ended up locking my online accounts due to this keyboard sending repeated/missing random keystrokes. The range of wireless of this keyboard is also very small-- it works only if you are within 4-5 feet of the transmitter dongle.Ergonomics are also very bad. Maybe its just me, but the placement of Ctrl, Fn, Windows and Alt keys on the lower left corner is in a very off sequence. If you use the keyboard a lot then you will very likely find it annoying.Overall, a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. Stay away from it!"
4,"I've ordered it during Amazon Great India sale for a little lesser price than the MRP Rs. 1399. It's working fine without a delay and I did not have to do anything to set it up, just works fine as soon as I plugged in the dongle. It comes with a single USB dongle for both mouse and keyboard. Mouse is in decent size and it will fit and palm size. It's not too small like some of the Logitech wireless mouse. Keyboard is so soft to type. I tend to press the windows key instead of Alt button may be because i'm used to my old keyboard. This comes with a Fn button to enable some additional control. Only negative point that i noticed is that, this does not have any indicator for Caps Lock, Scroll Lock or Num Lock. So we have to be little careful when typing passwords. It does not work with bluetooth to connect to your laptop."
4,"Friends, this is a ready to use keyboard and mouse with a provided wireless adapter. I purchased it for use with my Samsung Tablet. Keyboard is fine and with well laid out. It has though only one LED indicator and that too for low battery. You DO NOT get any indication for Caps Lock or Num Lock and this might be an issue while typing passwords.  There is no physical key to switch off the keyboard and you might want to take out the batteries everytime for saving them.The mouse is a regular, lightweight mouse with two buttons and a scrollbar. Mouse has though an ON/OFF switch.I read somewhere that the batteries on normal usage last till 1 year. However i can't corroborate it.You get in the package two Duracell AAA batteries for keyboard and one AA size battery for mouse. In addition a wireless USB adapter is also provided. With an OTG adapter(normally provided with mobile phones, as i got with my Samsung phone) you can even connect it to your mobile also. The mouse also works great in mobile.Overall a good buy. Thx for reading.Jai Hind!!!"
1,"Made a mistake of relying on Amazon choice recommendation while buying this keyboard. Reason, this keyboard is badly designed one especially with function keys. A good design will be function keys F1 to F4 in group a little space and the F5 to F8 little space F9 to F12 to identify the keys easily. But this keyboard doesn't have that separation. Right above backspace key F12 key should come they messed this up by having function key. There should be a provision in mouse or keyboard to keep the usb adapter safe when not in use, like Logitech.Bought this on 15th aug, can't even return this product now, damn. Regret for not buying HP."
4,"IT has improved in leaps and bounds. Very easy to setup, just Plug & Play. I've used another brand keyboard and mouse (similar price range) and have struggled with response speed (not sure if that is a thing, i'm no IT professional), the keyboard had to be close to the CPU. I'm amazed as I type this review from ~3mtrs. away line of sight (even thought the dongle is connected to the back of my CPU).Ergonomically the mouse is nice and compact and easy to grip. The keyboard nicely laid out (though I now need to get used to typing on it as I'm used to a more compact keyboard, FYI - I'm already getting better at finding my way around it.)"
2,Pros:Compatible with both MAC and Windows PC.Seemless in the setup - Just plug and playMouse feels greatKey Board is adequate and weights lessComes with the required BatteriesSingle Receiver for both Keyboard and MouseThe mouse has an on / off buttonVery less noise on the Keyboard strokesCons:Keys seems very cheapThere is the visible spacing between keys and board which definitely will let in lots of dustNo Caps lock / Num lock indicator on the keyboardKeyboard not right for a person who types fast and has small handsOverall I'd just like to say it's Made in China. You make a call.
3,"We cannot ask more from a wireless keyboard for a ~1100 INR.However, if you are a huge keyboard shortcut user then - beware, the apps key (for right click shortcut) is placed on top of the keyboard instead of beside the ctrl key.The spacebar is oddly placed, a littler far from left hand, making us press alt instead of space.No light indicator for num lock, caps, or scroll lock.Also, we cannot use to for long time, fingers seems to be tiring too fast on these.  Keys are a bit hard on press.Just typing this comment itself is tiring my fingers."
4,This is completely useless mouse keybaord combo for following reasons:1. Its space bar key is away from the left most key. There are 2 keys additionally in between. This layout is not standard layout.2. Mouse is extremely noisy and drains battery even when not in use.My advice would be to go with Logitech branded combo.
4,I had used three logitech keyboards in the past 5 years. All have failed due to dirt accumulation inside the keys. Hence I am trying a Dell keyboard with chicklet keys.My past experience with Dell had been good. They keyboard does not have a caps lock or num lock indicator. Also battery indicator will not glow at normal battery level which is confusing(supposed to glow at low battery).Lets see how the keyboard performs in the long term.Usage of 3-4 days: experience good. Keys are comfortable and responsive. Mouse ok.
3,"About usage experience - Just you would want in everyday usage, really god and keyboard is almost chiclet. Lovely.Product Quality - Really unfair!I have owned this combo for almost 2 years now but it just became faulty after 8 months of normal usage. By normal I'd say 2-6 hours a week.Initially mouse scroll became faulty but by the end of first year, some keys stopped working. By some I mean a complete diagnoal strip from Esc key down to A,S. (Esc, 1 Q,W,A,S,CapsLock,Tab). I guess this was some sudden circuit failure.NO I never mishandle my gadgets, I've been doing regular cleaning coverning when not in use etc. out of habit.Searching new combo again."
3,Product is good...and works very well in initial days like for 3-4 months...But after 5-6 months key are dose not stay as smooth n soft as it works initial days (when it cam Fresh new one)In office have 2 unit of same model of Dell wireless keyboard and mouse which is almost 1 yr old but the keys become hard to press.. and it make stucking noise while typing.It dose not stay Smooth like it working in initial days...!!
2,"Dell products seem to have lost their touch of quality as this is the second DELL product I have faced issues with within 3 to 4 months of purchase. The optical wireless mouse I'm writing about stopped working within 4 months of purchase. I'm still unable to search Amazon on how to apply for warranty claim. I did browse through Dell India website but the product is not found there upon searching. If someone has any idea on how to claim warranty for Dell products on Amazon, please help."
3,"The keyboard and mouse look great on your table, but that just about it. When it comes to ergonomics and performance it fails miserably.Let's talk about the keyboard first. It looks great with its flat keys and is extremely light weight, but once you start working on it you'd quickly notice that your fingers slip off the keys too often and you tend to make a lot of typos. The distance between the keys are also not ideal. Sometimes I also notice a bit of - albeit minor - lag during typing, which could be due to the latency introduced by the wireless link. So do not buy this keyboard if you plan on gaming - I don't.Now let us come to the mouse,  which is horrible. The mouse feet are too hard and they prevent smooth movement. I tried different surfaces including: ceramic tile, expensive mousepads, polished wood and plastic and the mouse tend to stick to all of them. In addition to this stickiness it is very laggy as well-  there is a noticeable rubber-banding. It is extremely annoying to use this mouse.I bought this for coding, and I had to switch back to a my old logitech USB keyboard. I have a mechanical keyboard but it is very heavy preventing me from taking it with my laptop."
4,"Keyboard and mouse quality are decent, but after 6-7 months of normal use, the mouse started dying all of sudden. I thought the AA battery died, so replaced with another new battery but after working for a few days it died again and then on happened frequently. Now after 9 months of use, the mouse is actually become useless, works for 5 mins and then you need to open the battery panel, remove and re-insert battery again to make it work.and there isn't a way i can claim the warranty. the product comes with 1 year warranty but thre is no way to claim it.@Amazon Please help"
4,"Bought this combo at ₹1,050/- and got the same-day delivery, so kudos to that. Writing few points below to describe the product:1). Built quality of the Keyboard is not great but is best for the price it's available at.2). Mouse feels really great and as it can be expected from any mid-range wireless mouse, the scroll wheel doesn't make any sound but the click sounds are a bit loud.3). There is no Physical On-Off button on the Keyboard, so once you install the USB dongle into your computer the keyboard will remain on until your system is shut down. However, the mouse has the Physical On-Off switch.4). Typing is not that great obviously considering the price you buy it at, if you are a 'heavy typer', would suggest you buy a Logitech or maybe some other model from Dell. The Keys are finicky and do not provide you much confidence while typing, so you tend to mistype. But for regular basic use, it's good and will definitely get the job done.5). Does not have Caps-Lock, Num-Lock, Scroll- Lock on-off indicators.6). Does have the new ₹ Rupees (INR) symbol included on the no 4 key.7). Mouse Does have a Small space in the battery compartment to store the USB dongle in case you want to take it out of your pc"
1,"The Keyboad stopped working after 2 months of use. As theproduct was under warranty, I had taken it to the nearest Dell ServiceCentre to claim the warranty with all the documents provided by the sellerand Amazon.The service centre executive mentioned that the Serial Number of theProduct is not mentioned on the Invoice. So, I can't claim warranty on myproduct. Even after showing the P-Slip Warranty, they will not be able toaccept my claim.After discussing with Amazon Customer Care Executive, I was told to write amail with all the documents and images of the product to get a new invoicewith the Serail Number of the product both the Mouse and the Keyboardmentioned in the new Invoice.I have talked to 4 different Amazon Customer Care executives but none of them could solve this issue. In every call I am being told to wait for the mail. But it has been 2 months since I have started the warranty claim process."
5,Excellent build and typing experience. Blue switches but not so noisy like my other blue switch keyboard. One difference is the spacebar written with god mode opposed to image shown on box. Otherwise all perfect. Keep bringing such products. Thank you.
3,Just now bought. Palm size keyboard
5,The keyboard is very good and the quality is as expected by Cosmic Byte. If you want a nice review consider Venom's Tech on youtube. He has made quite a nice review on this keyboard.
5,Overall the keyboard is really good except the blue switches produce a lot of tactical sound.
4,it looks good but it would look better without switch to god mode thing on the space bar and i really like that we can detach the usb cable but its a bit noisy it needs to have a linear switch varient too for all the gamers out there.
4,"It's not bad for the price. I got it for 1099 but would have been a better purchase under 1000.My ObservationsBuilt quality is goodLooks beautiful and elegantKeys and spacing is goodRGB light doesn't change color. It lights up in 4 fixed color from one side to the other🟢🔴🟣🔵So the characters on the keypad also appear in the same color.Backlight is dimmable in 3 levels and you can also turn it off.Only 1 Fixed durarion breathable mode no other effectLED under the membrane is visible, the light isn't spread evenly.LED under the last row/space key is slightly irritating.It looks elegant without backlight but then the characters are slightly difficult to read.In dark rooms you can easily use it.Grip at the bottom is good and riders are broad making it much stable. Gives a very good typing angle for hands.Can't really comment on typing experience, will get used to it after using for 2-3 weeks.Overall not a bad choice, looks and feels better than other so called gaming keyboards in the same price range.If you are not bad hardcore gamer and want a decent multipurpose keyboard at affordable price then go for it."
5,For this price ..thus keyboard is excellent. You never get it like this keyboard even with higher prices.there is a problem in space bar and enter key in the middle.other than that an wonderful product from evofox...please go for it 😀😉👍
4,I like it but I have given 4 stars because it have only one effect in RGB if there are other effects also then it will be the best keyboard among this price range but if you need performance you should go with this 👍
4,this is best keyboard ever i get in under 1000 metal body and litewaight with brided cable reviewing after 1 month of use go for it
5,This keyboard is pretty sweet. Looks and works great. The lights look awesome and it allows me to work with the light off. Works great for gaming or just typing.
5,Whenever you press space bar there's a squeaking sound.It's really annoying but the keyboard is worth it for 1000rs. It's built quality is good. It's good for this budget.
5,Gives the kids their fun factor... Lovely colourful back light lights....
5,1:very good rgb2:some parts the lights are not showing3:very good product for 999 rupees4:It does not have a software5:nice keyboard sounds very satisfied6:I'm typing with this keyboard7:overall 5 rate :) notice keyboard
5,"Very good keyboard, the keys aren't sticky like my last keyboard so that's good for gamingLove the light effect, makes writing and gaming in the dark much easier, I also like that you can turn off the LED"
5,"It doesn't have to customize colors, but other than that it's an absolutely cool silent keyboard. Good quality for how cheap it was. Haven't had any issues and I've had it now for a month."
4,Best budget gaming keyboard but keyboard 's key is small people with big finger tips will Hard time typing fast
5,"At this rate, this is the best you can go with.The only con is that rgb effects are very less, you can on/off them, control the brightness and switch to breathing mode. Else the keyboard is good."
5,Best Budget Gaming Keyboard for this price.Has Metal Plate to avoid damageAnti Ghosting KeysBest for seamless gamingEffortless typingRGB LIghting
5,This keyboard is really good. The RGB lighting is nice and it's not all that expensive compared to others similar to it. The quality is also durable as well.
5,The keyboard is quite sturdy with a nice look. The keyboard is quite light.
3,works totally finebut it's a little weird as its springs noise sound cheapish.
5,JUST AWESOME!
3,"the switches can be more soft, i give it three starts, it is okay that is it"
4,if your room is dusty than dont buy this bcoz this will not work properly bcoz it have floting key anyway it is decent for gaming and it have bright backlight
5,"The keyboard is great at the price point also I love it built quality, and design of RGB light  ,  so I recommend every gamers to go for it without thinking anything."
4,respone is very good 😍and i will its a value for moneythanku
5,This is a good keyboard for touch typists and also gamers.Very comfortable experience.I will say don't think too much just go for it.
1,"One key was malfuntioning when it came, returned it instantly."
5,This is value for money and just I want
5,I was skeptical initially as there were no reviews on this specific model.  But as a seller they had good feedback and took decision to try for  my  Dell Inspiron 15 - 3567 model.  Neatly packed and appreciate this as laptop keyboard is generally thin and  delicate to handle.  Installation took youtube help.  One observation is keyboard has metallic background where as original has plastic.  So while typing you can hear slight tapping sound.  Not an issue.  As of first day looking good.  Will post additional comments after few weeks/months usage again.
5,This keyboard is as good as original one. Packaging was very good. It's a very good buy atan affordable price.
5,This is a very good product for the money and it is very comfortable to fitAnd this is perfectly fitted for my laptop.Amd received before the delivery dateThank you so much
5,"Very well packed. Got it today, its quite genuine price and working good."
1,Very bad productThe response time is very bad
5,Nice packaging. Fast delivery. looking fine. Just got installed.
5,"Wow unexpected quality, product which i got all keys working perfect and comfortable to long term works as well. Really good product quality with affordable price and check"
3,I got this keyboard today. And I Happy with the packaging but the product doesn't look the same as pic. When it comes to the back side. Value for money I'll say
5,Keyboard is mostly genuine. There is no problem all keys are working and are very soft. I like the product... you can go for it
5,This keyboard is as good as official one. Packaging was great. It's a very good buy atan affordable price.
5,Mast prafect betha hai key board our mst chal thanks I love this product awesome👍👍👍😊😊😊
3,There is noise when typing.
1,This keyboard+mouse combo has not lasted even for a month. Mouse has lost its sensitivity and the scroll has become completely unpredictable. Keyboard is also poor but the mouse undoubtedly leads the competition.Keyboard has the unique ability to type a character multiple times while the key is pressed only once. So entering a password at any website is the most challenging task.I am fed up with this typing adventure so I just plugged my old keyboard & mouse back to the PC to share this critic.Please use your money wisely and buy some longer lasting & reliable product.
1,The keyboard is very hard and the keys don't work if you are used to pressing them the normal way. The only way to use the keyboard is if you can hit the keys hard like old type writers. Very uncomfortable and almost useless.The mouse is of very cheap quality. The scroll button the middle doesn't work half the time and sometimes scrolls in opposite direction. Mouse buttons are very hard too.
5,"Steps to use ₹ Rupee Symbol Download the Rupee Keyboard software to your computer from zinq website. Unzip the “Rupee_Keyboard.zip” file to any folder on your computer Double click the “Rupee Installer.exe”” from the unzipped files and follow theonscreen instructions This will install four new fonts to your computer Now, double click the “Keyboard Install.exe” from the unzipped files and wait till theinstallation is This will install a new keyboard layout in your computer Restart your computer Now you can click on the small keyboard icon on bottom right corner of the screenand enable the “Rupee Foradian Keyboard Layout” Double check that the “Rupee Foradian Keyboard Layout” is active Now you can use the key with Rupee symbol printed to type the rupee symbol byselecting the “Rupee Foradian Standard font” in the application you are using. Forexample, Word, Excel etc."
5,I have using this keyboard and mouse combo since past 24 hours. And trust me you cannot get a combo better then this in less then 500. The build quality of mouse is very decent however the build of keyboard can be better. However it does the job and do it really well. If you are looking for anything in budget this combo is a go to. Feedback is very good however the keyboard is bit noisy. It not a proper chicklet but spacing of keys is bet good and hand will set on this in no time.Highly recommend.
2,"Both the keyboard and the mouse are very painful to use!The keys on the keyboard are very hard and cause pain in your hand/fingers! It took me some time to realize it.Definitely, not worth the money!"
1,"This product is a really really mess.ON MY ORDER: I received the keyboard and mouse that had too much lagg as well as words are getting typed multiple times.ON MY REPLACEMENT: I received the keyboard that had letter ""R"" pressed into the keyboard and that too in 90 degree angle to other keys. Just imagine. The standard of this product.I m really clueless, just so poor quality. Yes, it costs very less comparing to other products, but that doesnt means to give unusuable product to a customer."
1,"Enter key started making noise on 5th day and stopped working very next day. I have returned the product. Do not go for cheap products if you are working professional or your work totally depends on keyboard. Its only for casual home usage, not heavy usage. Gamers don't even add it to your wishlist."
1,"Not working properly, better don't buy this product. As soon as we started using the mouse, we found it is waste product. I suggest don't go for this even if they give for freee."
2,"Both keyboard and mouse are noisy. Both miss keystrokes and mouse move about 1 of 5 times. This makes it difficult at times to pin point and click with mouse as it needs few extra moves to adjust. I still do not know how to use the rupee symbol as it does not have ""Alt Gr"". Maybe it needs some settings."
5,"Combo is nice, only one thing missing in the keyboard is palm rest, but considering its price it's good enough for smooth and silent typing. Decent mouse. Really love using it."
2,"Mouse stopped to recognize and got fixed since under 6 month warranty, customer service adviced to take it to service center to fix which is a pain. Now keyboard has loose connection. Mouse gorgeous repair again after six month, now out of warrenty."
3,"Apart from having few letters T, V and E getting repeated despite being typed once,apart from this one issue it is good purchase, just need to be doubly careful with the spellings. May be the keys sensitivity is set to high ..."
5,It is a good enough keyboard and mouse for your casual work. Not for gaming but the normal work is completely fine with this. Also the mouse is comfortable to hold.@349 it's value for money.
1,The product is not built with quality in mind. I have ordered twice from this brand and both times I was required to exchange the item due to malfunction. On this one for example- the ‘O’ key just would not work unless you applied extra pressure on it. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing this for work at all as you will need to go back and make changes to the email / document.
4,Video Player is loading.
3,"The keyboard is good at this price range, but the main problem is the mouse, the sensor of the mouse is just so bad that it teleports the cursor from one spot to another. Just don't buy this combo if you wanna play even some decent games or do some photo or video editing. 👎"
1,"Within few days of purchasing, it was evident that the quality was not up to mark. Many keys had to be pressed very hard to type. Disappointed with this product."
3,"This is one of the cheapest product you could get in mouse and keyboard combo.And it is not that good, atleast for me precision is not good in mouseIt makes sound also...I feel like this as a false marketing"
5,"Comfortable keyboard keys, Just as new design keys. Mouse also so comfortable within hands. Click & scrolling is better than any other same range mouses. Don't need to think twice... Just Buy it. ❤️ I bought these combo item in ₹469 INR only in ( Deal of the Day sell ). Delivery is also superb. Also, Amazon always deliver his best.Thanks Amazon ◉‿◉"

5,Zinq is an Indian brand. I would say quality of keyboard and mouse are of very good quality. Stylish and sleek as well. Highly recommended.
4,"Its great for the price, because u r getting mouse and keyboard, but little bit stiff keys. Ease is bit less but hoping it will be fine over a time of use"
2,"First I replaced it as the mouse was missing in the package. Now the keys ""W"", ""T"" and ""L"" aren't working properly.Sometimes the keys never respond and sometimes when clicked once, the letter gets typed twice.Not sure how to return this off as the return period is over."
1,"Please Don't buy any zinq productVery bad service.I have buy the product after 2 months my product stops working and product are in warranty. Still, they are told me we are not responsible.Thanks"
5,"Just Perfect i say 👍🏻 , nice and secured packing very good delivery time & Product is just superb. 👍🏻 I'm really happy 😊 with this purchase fantastic keyboard⌨️ keys and super smooth 🖱️mouse. Definitely i am going to recommend this to others👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻"
5,Good product my brother is using the this and he is very happy with the performance. If wifi keyboard mouse available then please give me as for review.
4,Its wired Chiclate keyboard. Comes with Mouse.Delivery  is Good and Product is light and compact to carry in Bag.Its not made for game. But good for typing.
5,I loved those keys and mouse is buttery smooth...In old reviews it may be bad but now they all had changed themselves and now they are sending a quality product at low budget...It satisfied my budget...
1,this product is fake I found about 7 keys broken and 1 scratch the quality was terrible made with plastic  in the image it was shown to be wireless I will return
1,Not worth. Mouse shows frequent disconnections and its a waste.
5,"It's a wonderful Combo in this price range 469/- rs , keyboard keys are very comfortable, keyboard is light weight & thin, best for this price range, You can blindly purchase it.!!"
2,You must go for Amkette Xcite pro Usb Keyboard and mouse Combo best value for money
4,"I would say this one is ok for money, but keys are not silent keys and mouse also not a silent, and mouse scroll bar not properly working its hard to scroll, over all average ptoduct."
5,"Value for money , initially I was little but confused that will it be good in condition and in working , but the moment I received it I was really very happy and surprised - it really is a good product and worth every penny it does done work nicely 💯"
2,Started facing issue within two months. Not recommended
1,"Don't buy the product quality is poooor,  USB almost Dead,  wire is a jock.. I suggest buy a brand like HP, dell etc."
1,Left Shift key is hard to press. All keys generally hard. Not smooth at all. I have many keyboards and this is the worst. Next time I will not fall for cheap plastic junk. Lesson learnt.
5,Soft typing and rates too.  Many times better and better than the zebronics and other mice and keyboards available in the market for 400 rupees.
3,Average performance....keys make noise while typing...mouse is little bit hard..ok as per price range..
3,keyboard is nice for home use but mouse is very very of low quality click buttons are not good sensor is not working properly
4,"Logitech makes great products, be it mice or speakers (and everything in between) and this K480 keyboard is no exception. Here's my review ~1. Looks wise this is pleasing. Black and lemon yellow combo is stunning. (10/10)2. Not much heavy and should be easy to carry around in your regular laptop bags. (8/10)3. Bluetooth pairing is as easy as it gets. (9.5/10)4. Very easy to type, button placement is good as compared to others. However, bear in mind the switches are NOT backlit and they make a little noise while typing, although not as much as some youtubers might make you think. (8/10)I use my iPad 2018 and my android mobile side by side with ease. So, this should be a good addition to your gadget list. Hope this helps."
4,"It’s a nice keyboard to have specifically if you have an ipad. If you want to buy the keyboard for writing long emails or you really want to work really fast this one isn’t for you. You really have to press the key significantly to type effectively.  When I work fast I tend to lose few alphabets due to not pressing key significantly.  Typing experience is not very smooth, sound of typing might disturb people around you. Built quality looks fine, it connects easily.FYI- my friend really like this and had no problem whatsoever while typing at any speed, he said he likes it the way it is. He said he didn’t accidentally typed any extra alphabet when he used it unlike other keyboards that types with the feather touch,If you’re like my friend you really should go for it."
3,"Update:- it weigh too much, I understand it is done to balance the device while holding but still its too heavy (850g). Was looking to return but unfortunately that is not available for this product. Reducing my review by 2 stars :(Was looking for a keyboard for my IPAD since long, my wish is to get something which i can carry while travelling and hence looking for ones coming as case but because of higer price point, i ended my search on K480.Great delivery experience by Amazon agent, booked yesterday night and got delivery today at 03:00 pm.Wrinting this review with the key board which explain easy to connect and use, within 1-2 minutes of opening the packet, i am ready to type.Looks is also strong so i think it will last longer.Will comeback later with detailed review however at the moment i can say at this price point this device will complete your requirement of not using laptop :)"
5,"UPDATE - connected this keyboard to my Moto G5 with the hope that I will minimise my wrist pain. Moto G5 running Android 7 detects this keyboard after a couple of refreshes. But typing with this keyboard in any app is a little weird. Some characters like ""y"" are repeated several scores of times. Same goes for the spacebar. There is a lag while the characters appear after you have typed fast at which point the keyboard becomes kind of un-responsive. I guess this must be specific to certain models or certain versions of Android or perhaps it is an app issue - I tried this on several chat apps, on social media websites using the mobile browser. So while I am not going to be using this with my cellphone (which is a shame really), I will still continue to use it with my MacBook. The rating still stands and my recommendation that this is a good buy still holds true.This is a brilliant product especially for the price point.The sound made is minimal, it reminds me of those electric typewriters my dad used thirty years ago, the same sound and feel. I think the sound is not nearly as bad as some reviews make it out to be. It is quite muffled. The keyboard is more like those desktop computer keyboards we are used to from ten years ago. That is about it. I cannot comment on the durability of the product since I have barely used for around 30 minutes. There is no backlight on this so that is a bit of a downer but there is another version that offers backlit keys but costs a bomb (relatively speaking). The keys are perfectly placed and I had no trouble blind-typing this review. The batteries are already installed and are prevented from discharging with an insulation tape (which needs to be removed - you just pull the end that sticks out from behind the battery panel)The packaging from the supplier was superb. Amazon's own packaging was brilliant too considering it is raining quite a bit in my neck-of-the-woods with decent plastic wrapping. Delivery was incredibly fast from time of dispatch to time of handover.At this time, I am toying with the idea of gifting one for my brother.If you are looking for a keyboard that relieves you of the tedium of stretching your back to use the laptop or desktop, you should clearly opt for this. I use a Mac and I had no trouble setting up the keyboard.As other reviews have pointed out, this is not as light as Apple's own keyboard but then that keyboard is at least five times the price of this product. This is only a blue-tooth keyboard and not necessarily a portable bluetooth keyboard.This is a recommended buy. I am glad I got this.EDIT 09.DEC.2018It has been a little over 4 months since I got this keyboard. I can tell you that this is one product I do not regret buying. In the interim I got myself an iPad Pro as well and this keyboard is what I use with the iPad. In addition, I also use it with my Windows 10 laptop and there has been no cause for complaint yet. The batteries are genuinely long lasting although I must on balance add that I have started using it intensively only in the past two months. The bluetooth connection to my Mac, Windows and iPad as well as my Android mobile phone is incredibly fast. The keyboard does not work very well with my Moto G5 since there is a lag and often the keys repeat themselves.This keyboard is quite heavy, tipping the scales at nearly a kilogram and that is a lot of weight if you intend to carry it  in your backpack while you board a flight or intend to travel light.Apart from these manageable issues, this is an excellent buy and is highly recommended."
5,"After a few months of using , am giving the review.- using it for my iPad Pro- way better than apple's keyboard- u can connect to three device at a time and can toggle using the wheel- the keyboard is old school type, noisy, but it's compact and easy for typing flawlessly- compatible with android,ios,win,mac- switches are well placed- battery life is too good- white one looks too premium- u can keep ur ipad or mobile in the place given for itCons- it's heavier than other keyboards but that makes it stronger- noisy keys like old keyboards but I like the sound it keeps me awake all the time in night shiftsGo for it .. Money saver.. Good product and better better than any other bt keyboards"
5,"The product works as shown in the video description.-- Battery Life--Not sure regarding the same as it depends on your use there is nothing to do with the keyboard as external battery cells are used-- Durability --If you hold it from one side you may hear a voice of plastic friction noise as the keyboard is total made of plastic.However, the keys are very smooth and are made of good quality.--Easy to use ---Product is designed to perform multitask, which it does without any error, the typing feels good on this keyboard and the switching between devices takes around 1/2 second.---------The keyboard is good for programmers specially, mine was a used one in an opened box which i returned and ordered a new one.I don't know, why these sellers sometime give used products to their customers, knowing that they will return it and give negative reviews and feedback."
5,"This device is absolute delight, haven’t given any case to think otherwise since I bought this on jan 19, i’e., after putting it through utterly rough and tough usage on gaming, photoshop, revit design and more than 20 days on typing thesis... hell im even typing this review on it!Pros:Durable bodyEasy pairingSeamless connection btw all three devices, just twist and switch!, even cross platform isn’t a big deal for this, working with win10, iOS 12 on iPhone and iPad all at same time, still bests my surprise!Keyboard is enough wide even adopts to my big handKeys are big and feels like stud, extra likes for that..Phone/ iPad  holder is awesome, angle of view point is well thought, can accommodate 1 iPhone and 1 iPad mini (docked mode) or iPad Air portrait mode and iPhone.For a rs 2000 keyboard this sure gives a posh feel.Lack of inbuilt li-ion battery is a winner for me, battery life depends on what battery you use, I’m still running on my first battery Duracell AAA.Cons:Heavy for its size and plastic built, need to loose some stuffs to compensate baggage allowance!.Lack of num pad is sick, but it’s not that big deal if you are used to small keyboardDoesn’t have elevate stand to raise the keyboard, it bothers me because I’m used to it.While on playing games sometimes the keys lags, while series of keys are pressed at a fast rate in a row it seems it puts some stress on connectivity, but this wasn’t the case with my onboard laptop keyboard on the same game.. need further study on this.Verdict: Overall this is an awesome keyboard that comes in handy in all occasions with some tolerance on playing games!, built in phone and tablet stand is a huge plus,"
1,"This is a true martial artist's keyboard, and if you are not one, then you are far too weak to even consider this.The keys are designed specifically to help build fingers of steel, that can pierce through concrete after just a month of using it for daily work.Beware though, if you are not tough enough to withstand all the training that this piece of meticulously designed ""board"" has to offer, you will lose, and it will win, always! If you do master it though, the epitome of finger strength awaits you."
5,Awesome keyboard.Purchased imeadietely after watching YouTube desktop tour from Prasad . I cannot comment onBattery life and durability not yet completed 1 month also.After 1 year of usage....ProsNice lookEase of shifting Bluetooth devicesShortcutsBonus:very helpfully for editing works(not of use for normal usage)Battery lasts 2-3 months for medium usage....Cons: looks beautiful but care should be taken for white colour....Go for black one if u can’t take that much care...No complaints till nowThis was truly value for moneyThis is genuine review.....
2,Recently purchased this Bluetooth keyboard. Haven't used it enough to review other aspects of the keyboard but my first impression was that it looks like a used keyboard.with Scratch marks on the backside of the keyboard and some to complement the front side too.. expected a fresh piece from the seller. Disappointed.
1,"First of all, many keys of this keyboard doesn’t work.  It’s really very heavy and I don’t like this at all. I got a defective keyboard  and then returned it and it got replaced by another defective keyboards whose many keys doesn’t work. I regret not buying the 600₹ keyboard now that my 2000₹ got wasted. I will probably never buy electronic goods from amazon. And when i tried to return the second defective keyboard it said they will take the keyboard but return me not a single rupee. So now what? Keep the defective keyboard"
4,"The white variant of the K480 looks good.Connects seamlessly with multiple devices through bluetooth. Volume control is easy . The Fn button does not have to pressed for volume control. Range of keyboard is impressive. Keys are not silent , but make a pleasant clacking sound.Works well with a Windows 10 mini PC, an Android TV Box and an HDMI enabled Windows 10 Tab. No drops in connection.The groove is very well suited for holding tabs and  mobiles. It has a rubber lining for firmer grip.The keyboard weighs approximately 1 kg  to prevent tablets from tipping over when placed in the groove. The weight might be a drawback for some."
1,This is for the first time i had a worse expereince shopping with amazon. After spending a sizable amount this is what you get - a torn package with a complete defective product. It does not connects to a pc or an android device because the connect button for the same does not works. When connected to an iOS device i found out that many keys dont work at all. Utterly disappointed with this level of service
1,Broken used peice received orderd replacement.Hope amazon replaces. It had 2 order stickers on it it was still on when received. Its broken and it was repaced with tape original tape was open and had marks. It was in 2 peice a bug dent and all locks broken. Extreamly poor quality control before despatch. Product is very very heavy not portable at all buy only if u want to keep at desk not for travel. Not used it as broken unit received. Will update if repalcement is received.I did receive the replacement the typing experience is not good the keys feel mushy. Total wastage of money
1,"Its a nice product. But, the piece delivered to me was not the same. It makes crackling sound on just picking it up. I thought it would be due to the heavy weight. But after few days I removed the instruction sticker to find out dents and scratches. A damaged piece was deliverd to me.Highly dissapointed, will have to think 10 times before shopping from amazon again!!!!!!!!!!I want a replacement."
1,"A defective opened keyboard was shipped by Appario Retail Private Ltd. When i connected the keyboard many keys were not working. I cant imagine a logitech keyboard to be defective on opening, so i suspect a returned/refurbished product was shipped to me. I have asked for a replacement, lets see if it works.., but this is not a great experience for me."
5,"I purchased this keyboard to type on my iPad and I’m simply blown away. The keys provide good amount of tactile feedback so you feel like typing rather than skimming like in other flat bluetooth keyboards. Battery life has been pretty good so far, yet to change batteries. The device switching works instantly with iOS, Android and Windows flawlessly. The shortcut keys work in all three OS as well. You have to pair this only once and forget the hassle of reconnecting every time. Only con is the weight but it’s required to balance the heavy iPads when you place it in the notch."
4,"Built - Typical logitech keyboard. Premium plastic material, heavy built. weighs more than a kilo.Portability - Definitely cumbersome to carry in backpack as it weighs just like any 14 inch laptop. But if you consider its price as compared to the apple ipad keyboard, its worth buying. It takes space of 14 inch laptop in a backpack.Ergonomics - it stands firm on any surface due to weight. it can carry weight of two large screen mobiles at a same time when they are parked in the fluorescent yellow slot or it can accommodate and balances weight of a 9 inch ipad and to that matter 12.9 ipad in portrait position. it never topples it contents. the keys are small and there is extra space between keys. those with medium to long fingers and those who have habit of tactile typing will be able to use it happily. the keys have matt finish for better finger grips but keypress are not soft. you need to apply some force while typing. it comes typically between apply magic keyboard and logitech desktop keyboard. typical experience is good but not the best.  key travel is about 2-3 mm which is adequate for getting a feedback while typing but there is no palpable bump or click for feedback from the keys. keys are typical memmbrane keys and at this premium price one miss the ease of typing on mechanical keys.The keyboard does not have any arrangement of increasing the inclination while typing so if we are sitting lower than the table, then it becomes cumbersome to type on the keyboard. there is no way you can lift its front part.. there are no extra foot pegs. the standard inclination provided by the keyboard frame is about 5-6 degrees.Battery - i am using it for two weeks and there has been not change in the battery levels as checked from within the app. definitely its battery efficient.Gaming - it can be used for casual gaming but definitely not good for serious FPS gaming. there is a definite latency when i tested it while playing game Forza Horizon. It can be used for racing games but not for multiplayers FPS games. The keys are firm and should withstand the brute force while playing games.The dial provided for switching between devices works flawless and instantly. I use it with windows 10 laptop, ipad and android phone. it works flawless. words coming instantly on the screen of the phone and typing with fast pace in social messangers really feels awesome. you are always the faster one amongst the group chat. its a good companion for those who use lots of social media from cellphone and want to improve their productivity by improving the typing speed and accuracy.Verdict - A definite YES for those who want portability, wase of switching between three different devices while typing and for those who want value for money keyboard for 2.5K budget. For casual gamers this is still a YES... for serious gamers its a NO.. go for a decent mechanical keyboard at this cost. For those who have iPad and want to increase their productivity and want near complete functionalities of a laptop without much cost, this is the best possible keyboard as it negates need for ipad stand which also costs a lot on amazon. So go for it. !"
2,"Good keyboard if you have multiple devices. I need to keep switching laptops, an iPad, and a desktop. Pairs on the first attempt, no complaints. Some points to consider before buying this.- The keys are noisy. I like it, some may hate it. Creeps into your telephone conversations/meetings.- Function keys are swapped, I am not sure how to put them back. F1 to F12 have defaulted to shortcuts I don't need them. I require the one used by Windows. Now I am forced to use the mouse.- Home and End buttons are missing. if you are dependent on those, this keyboard won't help, you need to compensate with other methods.- Alt-Tab between windows/tasks is hard to operate.Edit: After months of usage.- The keys are harder to press, it gets stressful to type emails, documents, etc This keyboard is simply not suited for long hours of typing. It is best suited for short bursts.- Looks nice only on youtube videos.- Alt-Tabbing between windows is dead, you need to have fingers made of lead to press it.- Causes rage, you'll end up occasionally smashing it due to lag while typing or playing some basic games.- as its too late to return this keyboard, I ended up repurposing this to less intensive tasks."
4,"Works fine. Connecting sometimes becomes an issue, but manageable.Great that it was switch between 3 devices.Keys aren't great, just normal.Compact. Works well if you don't wanna use up a lot of space.Cons:No Home / End / Pg Up / Pg Dn keys. Have to learn the keystrokes for each.It's heavy. Quite heavy. Not the kind you wanna carry in your backpack.Expensive, for the experience.Occupies the sole Bluetooth connection. You can't connect a Bluetooth speaker or a mouse to your laptop, tab or phone if they keyboard is connected."
5,"This is not a toy, unlike other brands that look cool but don’t hold up to prolonged use. Very little fatigue on the hands from extended use. The heavy base is needed to ensure the iPad doesn’t tip over even when improperly seated. My only complaint is that I often forget to power off the unit after use since the switch is hidden on the other side. The automatic Bluetooth power saver does help but I think an improved power off design could be researched for the next generation.I don’t need my laptop nearly as much."
1,"8-10 of Its keys stopped working within barely 3-4 days of usage in my 2 months of ownership due to someHardware failure.The mail response was a parroted one which asks to follow 5 step software troubleshoots for a hardware issue and once you’ve done that and expectedly fail to resolve they’ll tell you to walk in with the keyboard to one of the 7-8 pan India service Centers they have !They don’t have a pickup service, they will not allow to courier you.. and to top it all you won’t get response on twitter,fb,email and even the customer care number mentioned on their website is switched off all the time.When I checked the 1 Star reviews most others have reported the same problem which makes me wonder if this is a faulty lot which is being sold online to make sure people buying from small cities have not choice but to keep this without getting refunded.Was expecting peace of mind while buying this expensive hardware and got the opposite. This one’s going down the dustbin but I’ll definitely pursue these guys with the aid of consumer protection helpline.Avoid as its costly went dead for no reason and after sales service is non existent."
2,"I had brought this keyboard almost 3 years back. And this is what I think:This keyboard is bad. Aesthetically the keyboard is pleasing for sure. Ergonomically, it's alright. But the basic keyboard design is the only thing that is not what it should be.Keyboard Design: The keys are very noisy and has no feedback. You won't even know if you have clicked the button but your fellow roommate will hear you typing. Keys do not press evenly. Some need more pressure. In Windows, the Alt and Windows key for some reason shared the function weekly. For 3 days Alt becomes Windows key and vise versa. Yes, you got it right. That happened. I tried claiming the warranty but that was hard. I don't have Logitech service center around here. They told me that is the only way the warranty can be claimed.It has good things: Good bluetooth connectivity, longer battery life, it lasted more than a year. Seemless device switching. But it doesn't matter to me when the basic keyboard functionality is garbage.Don't get me wrong though. Logitech stand-alone is a great company. I have used their products and my friends have. I'm giving a second chance to Logitech in keyboards and I have bought another model. MK275.In nutshell. I do not recommend this keyboard."
5,"Probably the best bluetooth (separate) keyboard for tablets, phones etc.Pro's -1. Very Easy and Quick to configure and Pair (Easy to follow instructions are pasted on the top part of the keyboard so dont even need any manual)2. Can pair 3 devices at any time.3. Sturdy and good build quality.4. Slot on top of the keyboard to keep the phone or Tab in while typing.5. Duracell AAA battery included.6. Relatively compact dimensions.7. Device keyboard doesnt pop-up and thus you get to type while viewing the whole screen, unlike the partially covered screen when the device keyboard pop's-up. I use it for my 8 inch Tab and my phone (both Android). The best part is when you place your Tab in Landscape mode in the slot given on the keyboard it almost feels like you're using a small laptop.Con's -To be honest I couldn't find any specific problems, but if I had name a few then -1. Keyboard not backlit. (With this feature, it would have definitely been just perfect).2. I agree with other reviewer's that the weight is more than any other keyboard but that's mostly to do with balancing it when you place the tab or phone in the slot.I checked for better reference for others, the slot on the top can accommodate a Tab in landscape mode with the longer side measuring upto 10.5 inches.I almost bought a new laptop but kept going back to reading more about this keyboard and finally I'm so glad I bought this instead. Got it for a great price during an offer too."
1,"We are a software company and we wanted to purchase a great keyboard for our programmers and in that direction we purchased this product considering Logitech's reputation and brandPros:1) Compact, handy, nice layout2) Multi device switching with a simple roller switch is a nice feature.Cons:1) Worst keyboard keys, they are heavier, sticky and your fingers ache after prolonged usage.2) We received a brand new packed product but the device switching roller is not working properly. This ideally confirms the quality of testing Logitech has in place for their products.3) You will definitely miss Home , End key in the keyboard while editing documents or during programming.Those who spend more time at typing, this product is definitely not recommended. In-fact stay away from Logitech when it comes to keyboards, specially if you are looking for buying a ""great"" keyboards."
1,"When I first received this keyboard, I was impressed with its look and ergonomic design. It is heavy but that is needed to offset the weight of your tablet/iPad when you dock it inclined. However, the first thing I didnt like was that the feel of the keys was tacky.. so it might look great but feels like a CHEAP keyboard, even worse than the tackiest, cheapo keypads you'll ever find sold along the roadsides. But most importantly, after just 2 weeks or so, some of the keys stopped working, not sure if it's due to the cheap quality of the keyboard membrane inside.. and by the end of the month, two whole rows of keys stopped working altogether! So beware.. for SUCH a price, this keyboard is NOT worth it, especially if it barely lasts a month!!"
5,"I purchased the white coloured one. The keyboard pairs instantly with windows and Macbooks, I haven't yet tried pairing with Android tab yet. The Built is quite sturdy and the finish of the product is nice. As to the quality of keys, the slight concave depression in the keys help in typing and the keypad is well spaced out.Typing fast will take some getting used to but I am already able to type without looking at the keyboard. Very easy to connect and if you are looking for a multi devise keyboard for your workstation then this is the best. I paired this with a white logitech pebble series mouse and both work excellently in tandem. Would definitely recommend this. However note that this is not a portable keyboard and if you need something on the go you need to choose the other logitech model. The recess well built into the keyboard can easily support the one plue 7 pro and Samsung S6 Lite tab"
5,"Pros:- I have been using a Cooler Master mechanical keyboard for years and was concerned that the Logitech keyboard might not be as comfortable to use but the keyboard is really comfortable to use and without a doubt the best non-mechanical keyboard I have used so far.- Battery life is great, I use Duracell rechargeable batteries and I use the keyboard for 30+ hours every week and the battery easily lasts for 1 - 2 months.- Looks really good. The best bluetooth keyboard design I have seen so far.- Easily connects with devices, just have to press any key and it instantly connects with the paired device.- Can easily switch between multiple paired devices.- No need to power off the keyboard manually to save battery, it automatically turns off after about 30 minutes of idle time and just have to press any key to power it on again and it connects instantly.- The cradle firmly holds tablets and mobiles.Cons:- Keyboards are not backlit, so not comfortable to use in dark.- Doesn't have a stand so can't use the keyboard in angled position."
1,"I haven't seen more idiotic product. The trouble with blootooth connectivity is its range and speed and also when your laptop/PC booting up you cannot use your keyboard because, well, its bluetooth. So you need to enter your passwords using laptops keyboard. Moreover even if your device has booted up the connection is not guaranteed. Its really painful to get it connected for the first time after the device boots up. This is unlike the seamless connectivity of wireless adapter based peripherals. Supporting multiple OS and multiple devices simultaneously has dented its usability by making the connection process complicated. It is way easier to connect my bluetooth speaker to the laptop than this piece of cr@p.  To add salt to the injury despite being inferior device both in terms of technology and ease of use, it is priced higher than regular wireless keyboard and mice."
5,Best Multi device quick connect Bluetooth Keyboard. Uses Alkaline batteries so no of charging.No backlighting would have been better for night time situation.Can keep smartphones and Tabs but if kept in portrait we can't connect usb cables to devices to charge.The long hollow rubberized slot to keps devices is gerat but it hides the navigating buttons of the smartphones mainly as few lower portion of devices get hidden and the blutooth devices can't help in full navigating of  smartphones.
3,"Pretty heavy for a keyboard(that is good) and feels sturdy. the keys feel like they have been made from cheap plastic.the groove for placing the device could have been 2mm bigger to accomodate biger tablets like the iPad Pro 12.9(i know it is in the description that bigger tablets will not be supported)typing comfort is not that great compared to other logitech keyboards i have used in the pastlooking at the box, looks like this package was sold to someone else(probably used and returned) and now sold to me. it does have a single scratch on the plastic(not that i am concerned about)"
3,Very costly. Quality is very good 👍.Also very heavy although the size is smaller. Has 3 device support for bluetooth. Don't buy if you are a gamer. Weight of it reduces the chance of portability. I bought it before 5 months but used only 2 times now. Overall an average keyboard. If you want it in a single place without traveling it will be great for you. The Bluetooth reduces the tension of loosing the wireless keyboard receiver. Buy if you really need it .
5,"very good product.. the keys might be bit loosly jumpy when compared to your smooth laptop keys of a Lenovo L14 or my recent wide keypad of Dell inspiron, but howser given he seamless bluetooth connection you might not notice the keys...But while raching the backspace and restricting your fingers the the A's might take a few days of practice.. It definitely gives your the feeling to wirte more if you are a writing freak..the phone and tablet holder will just make life easier ergonomically and saves so much space when you have a clutter of books and the laptop hovering over the table, Best buys for a typical sit down laptop table"
1,"The product is very poor quality considering the price. Other product with similar price range are having good quality material.Grooves on the cover does not fit in the keys. It cannot be fixed to the laptop, free to come out whenever laptop is disoriented. So from my experience this product is overpriced, under built and doesn't solves the purpose for its make."

5,"Slightly overpriced, but no compromise in quality. I prefer black but ended up choosing the transparent variant as the black one would cover the transparent WASD keys. Fits well on Asus Tuf F15. Looks like it might get yellow after few months, but it's washable. The black one will remain the same no matter what."
5,The price is a bit steep and its a bit less sticky. Overall i would recommend it for people looking to safeguard their laptops from accidental liquid spillage and safeguarding the display as well because the keycaps of my laptop would press against the display whlie the lid is closed leaving tiny marks all over the display.

5,It can cover on ASUS TUF Gaming A15 2021 perfectly. It is great product.
4,"This keyboard is a little annoying to use. The box says quiet typing but it is not like that. The sounds of the key is a little higher than you’d expect but however, it varies from person to person. The mouse is good for small hands but for medium or huge it is a problem. Also the length of the wire for the USB is small and you may find it irritating. But I needed it for sometime. If you don’t have any problems with the things mentioned above, then this is a good product considering the price."
2,product is not so much good... but regarding the price it is good for some time use... for normal it is okay... but if you want to game then please with mechanical keyboard...this time I have not so much budget so I bought it for some time use... later I will buy a good mechanical keyboard and a wireless mouse
2,"You get what you pay for. Quality is satisfactory as per the pricing. Good for those who are looking for a temporary and less priced keyboard mouse. For longer usage and durability, I'd recommend other."
4,"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's as good as any other brand. I've used HP, Dell and Amazon basic over the years. Yes, their finishing is better but when it comes to the use this is as good as any of these brands. It's cheaper and serves the purpose. Definitely worth your money."
5,"Stylish, Value for money. If you are looking for a good keyboard / mouse at reasonable cost, this is the one. Works well for home office / kids online classes."
1,I am writing this review after 3 months of use.High precesion Mouse start doing malfunction.On single click it is performing double click operation.Keyboard keys are not smooth now. Keys Feeling very heavy while typing..Request you to Please inhance the build quality because nobody want to purchase the set of mouse and keyboard in every three months time period.
1,"Key caps are not good quality although pressing keys feeling not as bad, internal keys are feeling good but typing speed not match as touch key caps not satisfied. as per price. 538 Amazon delivered at home a keyboard and mouse so price worthy."
2,made with low quality materials. First time it delivered as broken piece and I want to get refund but no option for refund only replace allowded. quality key board we get Iball or such other companies on same price.
5,As per price it good related to other also have 1 yr warranty All keys are working i suggest to some poor students this product at lower cost
1,"Don't buy the mouse.  Not even a month product is not working. It shows usb not recognized. Even  some keys on the keyboard, especially the backspace button is hard.  I dont want to give even one start, but review is not submitted so I had to give one star"
2,Keyboard material quality does not value for money and key press sound is not goodBut overall nice working. It is good for 250 rupees keyboard and 100 rupees mouse. total combo price should be 350 rupees for quality of material

3,The key are little harder for typing .. and the mouse also not smooth ..
1,after 1 month keyboard and mouse did not work.
4,"keyboard quality is good at this price point, but the mouse is not that good. If you find the deal around 400 then only buy it. Good for tight budget peoples."
2,"Surprised as I found several flaws in this product. No led indicator in keyboard ie. Caps lock, Numlock etc. Since it is wireless, need to have On/Off switch to conserve battery.. missing in both keyboard and mouse.Edit on 04-Aug-2020 :Space Key gets stuck in keyboard and space character gets repeated.. unable to use at all."
1,"Utter waste of money.  Both the key board and mouse started malfunctioning after just three weeks of use. Bought this thinking that HP is a reputed brand, and can be trusted.  Now I understand that HP is a brand that cannot be trusted any more. and I see that many of my friends are of same opinion. What they say is that, now a days HP has became an untrustworthy brand."
1,"Low quality build for keyboard and mouse. Indicators are not working for Num, CAPS lock.Design of Keys are not good!Not worthy to buy !"
5,"This is a very good basic keyboard, keys are sturdy and very comfortable to write for long duration. The overall size of the keyboard is compact and ideal for smaller workstations. The wi-fi receiver is plug & play and very responsive. Mouse is bit flimsy but works very well. At its price point it is value for money. The only drawback is lack of Back-lit Keys but I can live without it as I use it only when I am working with my laptop at my workstation."
1,My mouse started malfunctioning after using a month. The right-click button triggers wheel functionality and the left click triggers right-click functionality. It feels impossible to contact the service center and after continuously trying for an hour the customer care suggested me to go to a service center as online support for accessories is not provided. I REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT
1,Worst keyboard money can buy. They even sent me a used one.Lot of good keyboards available this is not one of them
4,"Very Comfortable, Mouse was Smooth Handling, No Sounds In keyboard Press. nice product, ""But delivery Boy was Asked Me for extra Money For Shipping the Product Its Rude Act. He's Like:-Delivery Boy: Mister give extra Amount for Shipping this Product.Me: why Sir I Seen Already The Amount, its Shown me all  including Delivery Charges, taxes, GST+ & more , why even you asking me extra Money.Delivery Boy: No No Sir Give Some Extra Money, its showing me more in our website.Me: No I am not  giving you more money, i readied  all terms & conditions why should i give more money.delivery Boy: Its Ok Then, Give me How Much You Think, like Rs.30 Or Rs.50.Me: they are not paying You salary Or what, why are you wasting my time.Delivery Boy: its Ok then Its your Choice Mister.(Conversation END )Its Such a weird Act. Please Guys Give Such Attentions to This Conditions."
5,Keyboard and mouse works perfectly fine. Finger impression on the keys makes typing comfortable. CAPS key indicator not required since laptop has CAPS LOCK light indication. Mouse is super smooth and efficient.
1,Low rating for ridiculous services from HP.1st they send defective mouse.In replacement they sent broker key board with no battery cover backside.Wasted lot of time & looks like selling used product.
5,"Keys are smooth, Low sound clicks. Mouse clicks are irritating usually but this one had it's own mechanism not to play any sound with mouse clicks. you'll love it when you use it.The best option i loved it auto power of, to save battery, you need to press a key to wake it up as simple as that...Awesome benefit with battery indicator just above the number key padImprovement, It's better to Numlock, Caps lock & Scroll lock indicators on Keyboard"
3,"What is wrong with you Amazon? At first I received a completely ramshackle package. There was no battery, the mouse was loose. And this is not the first time this happened. But today I will write.The mouse scroll wheel turned out to be broken, and the keyboard was definitely a used one.I requested a return, and the new one I just now received is a new pack, I broke the seal of it. There were batteries, and the keyboard was completely fresh. I have been your customer since you were not in India! And you do this to your old customers. What do you think of yourself? You have become too big, eh?BTW, your competitor takes time to deliver stuff, but never does these cheap thrills.Coming to the keyboard, it is an average product. The mouse is light and uncomfortable to use. Avoid if you can. Buy Logitech, any product. I should have."
1,The keyboard looks and feel cheap (almost like a duplicate). The plastic finish is not smooth at all. Anyways started using it but to my horror the functionality was even worse. Few keys won't respond on single hit and few registers twice or thrice on single hit. Such a huge disappointment. Finally decided to change the keyboard but to my shock there is only a replacement option. I will have to find out if the replacement is better if not this item could get stuck in replacement request loop forever.
1,"I've complaint about the defected keyboard I received which was not working and the customer care executive assured me about the replacement with three working days, but even after 4 days I haven't received the keyboard and now it shows that I can not get refund or replace the same. I'm a very frequent customer of Amazon and this is the first time I'm facing this problem. It seems that Amazon also doing the same tactics like other e-commerce organisations doing after getting the payment. Even then I request the Amazon once again to replace the product at the earliest."
4,I’m writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. My work involves an extensive usage of mouse and few keyboard taps. So after 3 weeks of usage I find the mouse scroll has a squeaky noise when in scroll up or down. This kind of noise is usually expected may be after 6-7 months of heavy usage.Pros:1. Comfortable grip on holding the mouse and keyboard taps.2. No lagCons:1. Mouse scroll is squeaking2. Not value for the money3. Not a good build quality
1,"Completely disappointed with this product and never expected from HP, such a low quality product.After a week keys gets harder to type and literally feel pain and also ever week u need to change battery in the Mouse and holding mouse a myth, it pains there as well."
1,After some day mouse scroll wheel broken and when i caim for warranty its show that not covered warranty. Really pathetic situation. Previous i use Logitech mouse for more than 3 yr but no issues. But in this product issue is there i asked one of my friend he also brought that and facing the same issue. Plz don't buy
5,With work from home in full effect I needed dual screens and it was necessary to use the laptop as a screen. With this combo I was able to do that and have the freedom to use the keyboard and mouse free from the laptop. The keyboard is smooth and responsive and the mouse is small but powerful and responsive. The best part is that the mouse shuts off if not used for a certain period of time.
1,"I purchased this some 6 weeks back. It suddenly stopped working. My laptop ( even tried with other laptops) is not detected it now. For last 1 week , it was disconnecting  frequently now it completely stopped.Now sure how to fix issue ."
5,I read few negative comments regarding the product. I find it to be awesome till now. If there be any negative finding i will update my review. till date it works fine without any flaw. For notification of CAPS LOCK and NUM Lock i use a software called 'TrayStatus' it works for me
5,Pros:Sturdy KB and mouseNo click sound for mouseAuto off feature works well (for conserving energy); Just scroll the mouse button to reactivateCons:No inidcators for Capslock/Numlock
1,"No indicator for caps lock, num lock.From first month itself space bar and control key was too jam to operate. In 2-3 month space bar key stopped functioning. Waste of money."
3,"Liked the key design, mouse fills the palm ... Grips well. Didn't likebtwo things no switch off button on keyboard in case you want to clean it ... Mouse detection range fluctuates . sometimes doesn't detect so need to move close the transmitter on dekstop."
1,"Quality not good, no value for moneyBoth mouse and keyboard do not have On/Off switches which makes it difficult. Keypad sensitivity is not great. Mouse scroll wheel got busted within two months. Overall not a quality product"
4,Both keyboard and mouse have a soft feel when using. The mouse buttons are exceptionally buttery and feels good to use.Grooves in keyboard reduce typos but it could have used a palm rest
4,"Overall a nice combo of keyboard and mouse from HP.Pros: Keys are soft and easy to use.  Typing and playing games effortlessly.Cons: Power off/on provision is not in either keyboard or in mouse.However, not happy with delivery by courier service. They delivered my package break opened but luckily items are not damaged."
5,Gud product
4,Keyboard seems to be slow in communicating with the laptop. Battery in keyboard drains very fast  but mouse doesn't drain the battery fast.
4,Good combo with affordable pricing. One observation was sometimes the click is not responding for our actions
2,"The keyboard is advertised as multi device and MacBook compatible, BUT, does not work well with the MacBook. The Number Pad does not work with the Mac and the function keys are not compatible."
5,Good keyboard and mouse with automatic power on and off
1,Please help in using this mouse. It doesn't work properly. Very bad  mouse experience it not at all easy to use  . It pointer doesn't come up when we click at once. No click sound is there on mouse. And don'twork on every surface..
2,First product I received had a defective mouse so I asked for replacement even the replacement have a defective mouse
5,I order total 3 times this for all members of my family. Good price and very smooth performance light weight and also use far distance.
1,"Wrong description of product, neither slim nor have dpi/cpi switch on mouse.Description is of ho slim keyboard of ₹1599 and product showing is cs 10"
2,Absolutely worthless product to buy.Although delivered within 24hrs of ordering. The product had innumerous glitches and software problems right from the time it was attached with the laptop. The cursor started malfunctioning and draining the batteries within blink of an eye.DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
4,Keyboard and mouse is good quality and responsive. You will feel while pressing the keys of the keyboard. The only demerit I noticed is lack of indicators for Caps Lock and other locks.
1,"Within 3 months my mouse's scroller stopped working.Customer service response was as cheap as it can be.Service centres denied accepting product through courier, where I am ready to bear courier expense too.I don't recommend this product to anyone especially online."
5,Very nice product at this price Must buy for gaming and work form home purpose
4,Good sturdy and perfect with MAC as well.Only fault is that there r  NO LED indicators to know if caps or scroll is ON.
5,Wonderful product cheaper than what you get in park lane Hyderabad and many places here . Go for it.
3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
3,"Its a decent keyboard with backlit RGB. Considering the cost range, I was honestly not expecting state of the art ergonomics or RGB, for the prize range it does provide good value for money. However, you expect product to work atleast for a year without giving issues. For me, many keys did not work as expected after first 3 months. Apart from that, till the time it worked, it was a decent piece."
4,"Update: 2nd May 2019.....Changing rating from 3 to 4 stars. 5 months of gaming usage and it is still working!The product picture showed is not what I received. Two days of usage and the space bar gets stuck time and again. The keys feel very delicate hence this is not for heavy gaming. Perhaps not even casual gaming. Anyways, at this price do not expect a gaming keyboard.Update 8th Dec: Ordered a replacement and received it. Will post the update after using it at least for a week or two.Update 15th Dec: 1 week of gaming usage and the product is still alive. At the price I bought I think 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
5,"Got this Keyboard for Office use, the keyboard is sturdy doesn’t make noise and didn observe any cons ;If you are working from Home using your laptop I would recommend to get this keyboard or any other keyboard; we tend to type hard sometimes ; laptops are delicate and single key issue would make you run towards a service centre !"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
2,It felt like a really cheap keyboard although it actually is a cheap keyboard but still the feel while typing or doing any work and the quality of the keys the press nothing was impressive I felt like a better keyboard in a just a little more budget would be far better than this but if I was trip budget then you can go for this you can easily do your work and it won't disappoint you.
5,I received the keyboard in a sealed packing however the mouse pad mention on the box was missing inside the package when opened. I am returning the shipment and expecting a replacement.
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
3,"keyboard is awesome but i have use it more than 2 months its alphabets are fating down ,color nikal raha haii , aagar typing ke liya lena hai ti mat lo bekar haii ungliya dard ho jayengii ,gaming ke liya  thik thak haiii but uttna aacha nahii ahii 1k ki price maii aur v aata ahii thoda aur jodka corsear ke keyboard aata haii wahii lo best ahiii gaming aur coding aur typing ke liya best ."
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
5,"Very smooth around the edges and the keypress.,Prints on key also looks appealing.keys are silent.not a gaming keyboard tho.lets see how long it lasts ."
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,Produxt went bad within 1month of purchase and due to pandamic we arr not able to replace as visiting service center will take more time
2,Appearance is good. The functionality is worst. Some keys won't function and some keys repeats if you press once.
4,Quality of keyboard is acceptable in comparison to its price.
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
1,With great hope I have order combo but I have received damaged mouse ...it's very disappointed ...so I return the product and order another one hope I would be getting good quality product.
3,"USB cable is of very poor quality and very thin. But for the price, no complaints. Not suitable for gaming."
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,"Amount was reasonable, very smooth for handling too may be. But I don't know why the package was not good and safe because when I opened I found two broken pieces of Keyboard. Immediately clicked for a return."
1,Worst product ..... Received item in damaged condition twice.... Intex is much better .... Purchased intex .... And now I am working with it.
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
1,For one click it types more alphabetsSome time keys not functionsWhat to do now return date also overRaw material smells
2,The keyboard start giving issue in 2 mths where the keywords does not work and enters wrongs alphabet
3,Satisfied the product
1,"After 2 months of use, the keys are getting stuck when pressed. Do not buy it."
5,Excellent product
4,First thing is that I didn't received the Mouse Pad with keyboard as said in product title.
5,"What a keyboard. I was actually looking for a 60% mechanical keyboard but I couldn't find any and I stumbled upon this Ten Keyless mechanical keyboard. I had never heard of this brand before so I was a bit worried about placing the order. But trust me guys when I say this, the build quality, the switches and everything in this keyboard is rock solid. I am loving this keyboard so much. Typing on this is pure joy. The clicky tactile feedback of the keys everytime you click them is a joy to the ears. They say blue switches are not good for gaming, well they are wrong because it is just wonderful to game.About the RGB, well its not actual RGB because all rows have individual colored leds, but they don't false advertise it as rgb keyboard so that's good. It does have like 10 or so lighting effects which are dope.I have been extensively using this keyboard since I got it but I haven't yet found a con for it yet. I will update later if I can find any.People who are skeptical about buying this keyboard from ant esports, just go for it. You will love it."
4,"This keyboard is a beast for what the price is but i found where ant esports have cut down the prices ""THE KEYCAPS"" Just take a moment and check my pictures regarding this issue. On the opposite side of every keycap you can see them being not torn off properly from their mold. Ant esports hid this by placing these sides on the face you won't bother to look at. And if you just look at the keycaps with precision you can see thr transparent font under the keycap hasn't been cut properly and has deformed edges and all and if you look at the picture of the end key properly you can see the deformation. Eitherwise you won't notice this while using and this keyboard is still BANG FOR THE BUCK."
4,"This is a good keyboard. Delivers fully on mechanical part.Good build quality. Clicks are good and satisfying.The cons are not really that much for the 2k I spent, but there are some good contenders which are cheaper : cosmic byte etc.- The keycaps feel cheap, the font is not very clear- It is a pure plastic keyboard- limited themes for backlight- each row has a fixed color, not RGBI know i am nitpicking for a 2k mechanical keyboard, but its to give complete information.All in all a solid buy."
1,"I works fine for a year and so and died excatly after it. Not sure which of the keys ASDWERQZXC stopped wroking, either Its a glicth or bug but it keeps on disconnecting every hour (2/10 in every hour), which is little frustrating if you are ingame. Those few seconds are very crucial in game for me.I am in a postion where I can't avail warranty as its already out of it but let you all know my side of the story. Tried mailing and  calling no response from company. 2.3k is big amount if product die on consumer like this."
4,"This keyboard and Mouse set was very good, below are few Pros and Cons i observed in the past 2 days:1. Keyboard is sturdy2. Keys are elevated so typing is easy3. Mouse looks good, it changes colors every minute or so4.  we can choose keyboard back light colors ( 3 options)Cons:1. Keyboard ""ENTER"" button is little hard2. the painting of the keys on the keyboard is very light, even under back-light not that much clear3. Mouse has extra buttons on the left side (prev, next) which are prone to get pressed very easily. we need to be very careful while pressing mouse left button as they are placed just beside the left mouse button.Except for the keyboard keys and mouse extra buttons, overall the product was very good."
5,"The overall build quality is good and the mechanical keys are good too. The tolerances are a little loose on the key-stems as compared to cherry keys but still acceptable for the price and would not matter much, as they are still far better than rubber dome keys. The keyboard is heavy and feels quite sturdy like the old computer keyboards used in offices. Some of the keycaps (specifically the bottom row keys have some abrasion marks on them, probably grinded to fit them in tight spaces) but this issue seems to be minor when considering the typing experience at this price (Rs. 2099)."
5,"This keyboard is definately one of the best keyboards I have used. I need to type documents for school and play games fairly often. This was my first mechanical keyboard and I cannot compare it to other keyboards but I can definately tell it is not a scam and that mechincal keyboards are objectively better than membrane keyboards.This keyboard is a TKL design which means it doesn't have the number pad and takes up less space. This is very helpful to me as I don't use the number pad and it saves space on my desk to put my notebook around so I can make notes or refer to it when needed.This keyboard also supports many features other ""Gaming"" keyboards would, such as locking the windows key so that you do not accidently click it while playing video games. It can also open the ""Grove Music Player"" , ""Calculator"" and other desktop tools from teh funtion row of the keyboard which is unique to only this keyboard from what I have seen so far. I have also seen a significant improvemnt in my typing speed. After taking a typing test with both I went from 40 wpm to 60 wpm but this wasn't a controlled test and I only did one type race from each keyboard.This would all tell you that this keyboard is functionally perfect I would say. However, there are few nitpicks I have with this keyboard.The font for the switches are very bold long and have gaps in them making them appeal to an ""edgy"" audience. I wouldn't use this keyboard in front my boss if you work at office. The keyboard also has the ANTESport logo on the Spacebar and near the arrow keys which is a little too extra.The keyboards aren't RGB. Each layer has its own colour. For example, the top row has red, the one bellow it with the numbers has green, then the third row with QWERTY has orange. This cannot be changed and this mixed colour doesn't match my colour scheme of Black, White and Blue This wouldn't be a problem but there is no option to switch the lights off.But before you buy this, please do know this won't make you a better gamer. Objectively there are tools which would help you perform better but I would say at least for FPS games the mouse is something which I would put money towards. If you have a mouse with a good sensor, please consider buying a mouse bungee because this keyboard does nothing to help you play games other than being small and leaving space for your mouseTL;DR-Mechanical Switches are good and improve your typing speed-Small Keyboard as it is TKL which saves space on your desktop-Supports useful features such as Windows Key Lock-Increased my typing speed from 40 to 60 words per minuteHowever,-Font isn't good-Lights aren't RGB, only light up one colour-Logos are shown too muchAlso NoteThis keyboard won't make you a better gamer or help you perform better in FPS games at least unless you are trying to save more space for your mouse."
4,Good enough..... weight is quite good....but don't know what kind of blue switch has been installed inside.......the action is very good for gamers.......Palm rest is small but help user a little bit than a normal one with out palm rest...No gold plated.....but the breaded cable is phenomenal..Rgb effect is decent but quite better than mk3000.....Umm ...you are also getting. A coupon of 1000rupees to redeem to the world of war ship game .....My review video available on shadow of 750tiAnd take a look to my insta handle avikbiswas798
5,Reviewing after two months of use....Great mechanical keyboard by Ant Esport...Also recieved a 500rs voucher of WORLD OF WARSHIPS inside the box....Blue keys are perfectly working....Overall very great experience in gaming....No cons till now except the tacky sound of blue keys....
1,What is the warranty of this combo set ?? Showing on Amazon portal Three Year.>On product box One Year.>On HP site putting Product id and serial and found this is a fake item.
5,"This laptop keyboard is completely situated with ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 (2021), AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 14-inchBuy it with hesitation.👍👍"
5,"I had asus vivobook 14 flip and the dust accumulated a lot at the base of the keys so I got this. It is very good cover though slightly overpriced but does all the work. I fits perfectly only few buttons are arranged differently in my laptop so, slight confusion is there but still does the intended work perfectly."
5,much needed cover
5,"Good fitting, smooth and with best price 👌👍"
4,Good cover for keyboard as shown in figure it has 17 keys in the upper section on fn keys including power on key . Fits reasonably on keyboard.
5,Nice keyboard .. surely better than Logitech one. Smooth keys  and mouse makes no click sound. worth buying it.
3,"Good keyboard, gives you laptop keyboard like feel. Good response if you keep the wireless received close to the keyboard , but if you move the receiver a bit far the response becomes immediately sluggish. As an example moving the wireless dongle from one side to other side of my mac changed the responsiveness of this keyboard drastically.Backspace key is too slow - and I mean too slow, keeping it pressed doesn't speed up the deletion. Trying to exploring system preference to improve it. I did get improvement with keyboard and mouse response times by adjusting system preferences, but backspace still is bad. (Update: Its working fine for windows after I adjusted the settings in windows, I have yet to see this for mac - which is where I noticed the issue in the first place)The size of the keyboard is slightly smaller than the size of the standard keyboard so it will take you some time to get used to it.  And if you are thinking of this as a drop in and compact replacement for your standard keyboard, you will be disappointed because it will not give you the same feel, and switching between the two keyboards will be hard as the minor differences in the positions of the key between this and the standard keyboard will mean you will do more typing errors initially. But once you get used to it, it will be just fine. It took me 10 mins to get used to it.  (I know its a mini, I am comparing it with the size of standard querty layout)"
5,Absolutely perfect.. i wanted a sleek keyboard for my office computer without the wires and yet wanted a stylish keyboard which will catch the eye of every customer entering the office...and yes...it did the job..1)..it's working is good.. instant connectivity to my laptop and keyboard is absolutely silent and the mouse is absolutely noiseless. The mouse movement is easy and efficient. Both the keyboard and mouse work effortlessly and noiseless.2). The keyboard and mouse..both look eye catching and gorgeous.3). Easy to carry in my laptop bag in front zipper without any hassle..due to small cute size.4)one small issue i facd is my hands are big and fingers are thick...so i had issues of double typing many times and extra keys typing...but i am now used to it and the errors are reducing but for small hands..this should not be a problem.It's good buy. I am satisfied.Jai Hind
1,"Plus1. The key board and mouse build quality is very good2. Button clicks are awesomely smooth both in keyboard and mouse3. White and blue colour looks ergonomically beautifulMinus1. The are no page up / down, home and end keys. If you have lot of typing work then this would become difficult for editing2. Space-bar, enter-key and back-space are little bit loose compared to other keys2. The product seal was open when I received my package. I see yellow colour stain under the keyboard. In short this is a very good product from a bad sellerI am writing this review before returning this product"
1,"The mouse cursor movement isn't as smooth as it should be on smooth/glossy surface, keeps hanging intermittently.  But it is not mentioned anywhere in website description. I have lenovo/hp mouse which works without any issue on same surface. Also there is no on/off switch in mouse.Keyboard is Ok, not much smooth. Very difficult to adjust if you are used to work on laptop or normal keyboard. Right shift key is not at the regular place, it is on the right end.  Also, the keyboard misses keystrokes sometimes. There is no page up /down /home/end button.It is overpriced."
1,"Usually, I don't write reviews but for this product, I just want to share few things. Let me be straight forward, this is a TOY Keyboard. If you are looking for a reliable keyboard to get your thing's done, you'll make the worst mistake by opting this keyboard. Few points to consider - Design flawed, poor accuracy, and battery drained within 4-5 days of normal usage. For gamer's, it'll disappoint and rates for you'll be losing the game and for people trying to get your thing's done, it'll irritate and annoy for you'll waste all your time into corrections. Like I said, it's a toy keyboard to slap random on the keys. Go for branded like DELL or Logitech."
3,"Mouse is pretty good but its gonna take while to grab the hang of the keyboard, Keyboard is a bit heavy.Overall its a decent combo.Returned : Keyboard isn't that great."
5,The best buy ever........Portronics is not a leading branch in computers pheripherals but if you compare this product with any branded product..you will definitely not regret this buy....Keyboard and Mouse in a single receiver....Compact and awesome....Mouse is almost zero click sound....its a silent mouse....Keybaord is equally good....Definitely  go for it without a second choice....While other at a higher price will provide you with only keyboard..this provides you keyboard and silent mouse...Only drawback is the key board has no LED to indicate Caps lock...Num lock..however this will not be as issue if you use laptop...
3,"Writing this review the very 1st day. My initial impressions are good1. When I opened the box, I was disappointed to see a detached key ( right arrow key had got detached). I fixed it and it was working fine.2. Absolutely zero typing noice. Typing is silent. Some might not like it.3. Keyboard is a bit laggy when you type, but not a deal breaker. All the keys are working fine as of now.4. Mouse is accurate and sharp5. Plasticky, but sturdy.Last but not leastI did not find any ""battery included"" as advertised. Greedy seller migh have thought not to include for this price.For 999, it is still a bit expensive especially if the seller does not provide batteries. For my existing rapoo keyboard, the company had provided free and hight quality batteries."
1,"Worst product I ever bought. Don't waste your money on this. Some of the keys are faulty. Both shift keys on my keyboard does not work properly with some other keys. I emailed to their website, since it is under warranty, but they didn't respond. I kindly request Amazon India not to sell this type of ordinary product which doesn't provide support to the customer. I should have bought something like a Logitech with some extra money. Anyway I have learned a lesson."
1,"The keyboard was pretty good in the first month ,it took some time for me to get adjusted with the small keyboard. Other than that I didn't find any issues. But now, the number keys are stopped working,I have to press heavily to input the numbers to my laptop. Sometimes even that doesn't work. I can't use this keyboard anymore without the number keys properly working. Please go for a good branded keyboard guys."
1,"Just an initial feedback. Item was despatched on time and with good quality. Btmut the 2 AA batteries were missing;-( which is disappointing. I need to go out in this pandemic situation to use this key board and mouse that destroys the whole purpose of ordering online and when they dont deliver as per the item description.I will share the revised feedback after I start using it.Update of using it after 2 weeks (24Aug2020) :(1) the right shift key is actually available but much lesser in size and I just got used to it when compared to the normal key board.(2) there is a significant volume that comes with when working in the night time and I couldn't really turn it off on my Windows 10.(3) very important minus I feel is after a period of inactivity, the mouse loses its traction and connectivity which is good but I cant get it activated just by pressing any key. All I need to do is take off the  battery and reinsert it on the noise to make it work again.Kindly do suggest the best alternatives for the above points.Update - after using it for 3 weeks (06 Sep 2020)======================================Mouse is a gone case. Even during the active working duration now, for every click I need to take off the battery and insert it again. There is no switch to toggle it. Totally hopeless and I missed the return window in Amazon as well. I regret having purchased this product. Should have gone for a better one, even with a higher cost!!"
3,A good combo of portronics keyboard and mouse. The size of the keyboard is just the size of space occupied by the keys on a keyboard. The top portion has some extra area. A bit uncomfortable for those with long fingers who got accustomed to keyboards with space on sides too. Mouse doesn't have an option to turn on/off. I received the product without batteries and therefore -2 stars so that they might not continue this error again and look into this. Overall if you feel like you can get adopted with this size you can go for it as there are no more flaws in this combo.
3,"Bought it 8 months ago for my MacBook Pro Dual screen WFH setup.Initially, I found great value for my money. Thought a much better alternative for expensive brands like Logitech, etc.  The mouse wasn't noisy but smooth enough. Keyboard gives you a nice feel while typing. Handy function keys.After a long use, I do not feel this is a reliable partner, especially if you are programmer or write long reports like documentations and proposals. Why?1. Constant missed keystrokes.2. Sometimes a single keystroke might print something twice.3. Although the keys are big enough, they are cramped very closely. Might not be a problem for all, but if you have broader finger tips, could be you constantly keep making mistakes unless you have an auto-correct or spell checker enabled.4. Perfect for Windows, but if you use an Macbook, the layout and functions could be very confusing remembering the combinations.5. The mouse stopped working very recently.6. The mouse too would not register the clicks sometimes and sometimes registers more than necessary. Although this behaviour is quiet common in such class of keyboards, this is way too often and noticeable breaking your flow and frustrating you enough.7. The keyboard is showing signs of deterioration with this fault behaviour being more pronounced these days.If you're using a Wireless Keyboard and Mouse as primary input devices - like in a dual screen setup as I do - and heavy on typing and use a lot of shortcuts in working, this product could be placeholder until you find a better one but honestly, its not meant for professional grade workload.And the same could apply for gaming, because delayed and unnecessary keystrokes can change your gameplay and hence the outcomes."
5,"I totally love this keyboard and the mouse!Initially, I was sceptical about it but when I opened the package, I was like, ""This is the one!""This is so beautiful to look at. It is smooth and easy to use. The keyboard and mouse are light in weight and easy to use. The mouse clicks are literally silent. The keyboard keys are like the ones I wanted.  Chocolate keys as they call it and I like the clack and click sound when I use it. As per the description, it does have long-distance transmission. I just feel that the 'Prt Sc' button and the 'Shift' button were exchanged. [Maybe because I am used to the original keyboards. It might take some time, but I'd get used to this placement as well.] The size is also good. The height of the mouse and the keyboard too is good. It is comfortable to use for longer time periods.Overall, this is worth the money and is a good buy."
5,"Good for moderate amount of document  typing and coding. Being a membrane keyboard, this is does not give you a good response while typing but it has very smooth and light buttons. After 2-3 months of daily extensive use, I can confirm that this keyboard is excellent for normal use.Right bottom side is a bit cluttered with to many keys; after all this is a compact keyboard.Mouse is awesome. It does not have a power button but goes to sleep after some inactivity. It's silent easy to use, comfortable size and nice scroll wheel.The keyboard hard some scratches on top right which was disappointing."
3,"This is a small keyboard apt for laptop but I am using it for desktop. Writing this review after 4 weeks of use.The WiFi plug is at the back of the mouse, take it out and plug it in to your usb port and insert batteries to the keyboard and mouse and you are good to go.It looks pretty and is noiseless but at times some keys get stuck and you have to manually push it up. Many functions of my old keyboard enter is now performed by the shift key of this key board. Mouse also gets stuck suddenly and can be very inconvenient when that happens.If you are used to the bigger keyboard, it might take some time for you to get used to this.When I tried to register warranty through QR code provided, it just wasn't happening.Ideal for laptop, but for desktop it is better to go for the bigger key board if you are used to that."
1,"The keyboard is small and compact. Same as the size of a laptop keyboard. Keys are soft and responsive. Looks are good. But, one huge mistake they did is misplacing the right shift key. There is a prnt screen key in place of shift and the right shift key is placed to the extreme end of the keyboard and is of small size which makes it difficult to reach and typing passwords becomes challenge. On/off switch on both keyboard and mouse would have been an added advantage.  How long this keyboard will last? Only time can tell us.  Another imp thing is this keyboard combo is available for 999rs on official portronics website. Here in amazon the price is 126rs higher. Amazon is cheating its customers in the name of prime membership. Which has become worst these days. Many of the items have etd of 5 to 7 days."
2,"Reduced the rating from 5* to 3*. Writing this review after 3 months of normal office usage.Pros1. Uses less space2. Keys are soft and accurate3. Keyboard battery consumption is much better than mouse battery consumptionCons1. The keyboard letter paint is getting faded2. Mouse, though is good but is a fuel guzzler that the battery consumption is very high (Duracell battery lasts only a month and everready lasts hardly 15 days). There is no way to switch off the mouse (auto off) but still consumes batteryI have switched back to old Logitech mouse as it has better battery managementIf I had an option to return, would have done so and have opted for Logitech wirelessOther than listed I haven't seen any issue with usage"
5,"Have been using since 3 and a half month. The keyboard is more like a mechanical toy with more than needed travel space. The mouse is great, infact I would say that it is better than the keyboard. It makes no sound on left and right click, however, if the middle mouse button is pressed, there is a normal clicking sound.The keyboard is completely water-proof. I mean it. Once I left it near an open window and it rained heavily. When I got back, I could see that water had enter the keyboard and literally ""filled"" the entire keyboard. I removed water by inverting it and let it dry. It kept functioning as it was.I use it on a macbook, so I feel that the control and function should be switched. Even if you configure the settings in mac, the control key or any other key just cannot function as the function key. So this was an issue. However the function key could be configured to function as control key, but then in some cases, it will still perform the functions of the function key!The right shift key is very small and not reachable. Programmers will find this annoying. The control key, as I mentioned, is on the extreme - bottom left and barely reachable, which is another thing that will bother programmers.Battery Life - I need a new battery for mouse every month(I use the laptop for 12+ hours a day). Didn't need to replace the cell in keyboard yet.On/Off Switch- Contrary to what few reviews have mentioned, there IS a switch to turn the mouse off. Just remove the usb plug and then press any button or just glide the mouse a bit and the light at the bottom will turn off. Keyboard has a long battery life and will not need to be turned off.Also it is a china-made product. It doesnot come with a setup manual. Both these things hurt!"
4,"Update after 3 month heavy usage (7-8 hours daily) , it's still working but battery backup is a worry. Keyboard battery lasted 2 months but the mouse one lasts hardly over a month. Just changed the battery on the mouse for 3rd time.If you are a daily user, you might end up buying new battery every month.Using this for the last 3 days. Pretty good for the price. The mouse feels light and fast. Keyboards buttons are nice and soft though the chocolate keys have bit too much play for my liking .I took the white and cyan tone which kind of looks vintage (in a good way)Both keyboard and mouse doesn't have an off switch but the mouse seems to go on a sleep after roughly 5 mins of inactivity.If you want to try out a wireless keyboard on budget, just go for it."
2,"I think i received an opened product. Batteries are fine, but no warranty card? Something suspicious. Also I can see that the QC sticker has been opened and placed again, i'm thinking someone has already done some repairs on this. Not to mention the product came all dusty with a fake seal.Let's see how it goes, if anything happens i'll return this asap. Feeling a bit worried if it will last long especially without the warranty card.Usage wise, mouse is good, but for keyboard, you need some time to adjust with the layout.Update 1: Mouse is good but keyboard is not that great especially if you are into programming. Also one key is not working. Thinking of returning this and buy Logitech. I bought this for the keyboard as i already have a Logitech wireless mouse.Update 2: Keyboard battery indicator is blinking. Its not even 1 week I started using this. Also mouse stops working intermittently. Very bad experience.Update 3: Battery died today. It has only been 1 week. Very bad experience. Hope amazon takes return."
2,"Good. But the size of right Shift and its placement is a big let down.I already own Logitech MK240 NANO (here onward Logitech) which has the same form factor as this one. I bought this Portronic only because of the blue color. Price was not a consideration while buying this.Plus points:Cheaper than Logitech if price is consideration.Note: Battery life may differ. I haven't tested battery life of both.It has capslock indicator. Logitech doesn't have.It has battery level indicator. Logitech doesn't have.Its nano receiver is ergonomically shaped. Its nano receiver has extra wing-like design and rough surface for easy grip while removing the receiver. Logitech receiver doesn't have this. Check pic for comparison.Portronics needs only 1 AA for keyboard and 1 AA battery for mouse. Total 2 batteries. (I am not sure if there is any older model which needs 2 AAA batteries. Mine requires only 1 AA battery)Logitech needs 2 AAA batteries each for keyboard and mouse. Total 4 batteries.Price of 1 AA standard quality battery: Rs 15/ piece. Rs 15x2=Rs 30Price of 1 AAA battery: Rs 13 per piece.  Rs 13x4=Rs 52.So, if battery life is the same for both the brands, then you save money on battery on Portronic compared to Logitech.By saying ""standard quality"", I mean non-Duracell or Energizer or similar batteries.There is no on/off switch on both keyboard and mouse. Logitech has on/off switch on mouse but not on keyboard. This is not a deal breaker. It is likely it has auto off feature. There is no mention of auto off feature. But the user manual says ""Five times more power saving than ordinary devices"".Minus point:Right Shift key is smaller than the standard rectangular size and is placed at far right. At the place where normally there is right Shift key, there is Printscreen key.It is very inconvenient for me as I have to use both shift keys a lot in my native language typing and also English typing. Because of this flaw, I had to return to product.One reviewer said the keyboard doesn't have Home and End keys. Maybe it was an earlier model. Mine was manufactured in August 2021 and it has Home and End keys printed on arrow keys.Suggestion: They should make the left Shift key standard sized, just like the right Shift key. Shift keys are used a lot for capitalization while typing.If they change the right Shift key to standard size and battery lasts as long as Logitech keyboard, then I think it is a serious challenger to Logitech.Lesson I learnt: Always check product pics and see the placement and size of keys like Enter, Shift. If you use Home/End keys a lot, then the size and placement of these keys are also important."
4,"I already own the very same product in green and white color that I have been using for my office laptop since the last one year or so. Now I have ordered it for my personal laptop and it finally arrived today. I must say that I am very satisfied so far. It hooked up very nicely with the laptop (HP Pavilion) and is working smoothly so far. In fact, I had some issues with the earlier version where mouse lagged behind a bit when switching from keyboard to mouse, but although its a small irritation, I have overcome it by always clicking the mouse once, before using it. That action immediately brings the mouse back to life. That action has now become so natural to me, I hardly ever notice the lag. This new set that arrived today, however, does not even have that issue. Mouse is working perfectly fine. I even set up my previous combo (the green-white) one to my personal laptop and the mouse worked fine there as well. So, I have come to the conclusion that this combo may work perfectly on devices with a high RAM (>=8 GB). I love the ergonomics of the keyboard and the mouse, and the fact that they are so silent and smooth to work with. I have re-purchased the same product for this reason only. The only reason I am deducting a star is because they did not include the batteries with the product."
5,"Oh boy oh boy !!!Bought this combo in a sale for lesser price, i was having a tight budget at that time and does not want to invest a lot on this techi, then saw this Portronics combo... I have been already using many products from Portronics and they are very reliable brand so went ahead and placed the order...I was so happy and amazed to see the product it came in good packing...- Small Keyboard (without NUM pads on right)- Noise less click mouse- Handy- Innovative- Light weight and easily portable- Best buddy for Laptop - Work From Home users- Keyboard keys are sooper !!! i like them a lot very soft and good feel when you type with out having a typewriter sound- I bought one more after using the first one which was RED and black (most loved), second one was white and blue which i am using for my Desktop..._ Big thanks to Portronics for the product and Amazon for delivering it*** NOTE: Product does not come with Battery, we have to use normal AA batteries 1 for keyboard and 1 for mouse... Happily it will last long no doubts on it"
3,"This is not suitable if you type a lot. The keyboard is smaller than in the photo. The keys are wide and evenly placed. But to accomodate all keys on a small board, a few keys like the Shift key on the right is moved from its usual position, which can be confusing. Initially, you will probably end up mis typing a lot of words.  Mouse is ok. I don't think it's very durable for longer run. I wanted a smaller keyboard, I don't type a lot frequently, and I purchased it for 800 Rs. So, I guess it worked out for me. Consider your main needs before buying this."
5,The plastic isn't the greatest ...The battery cap on the keyboard looks like a Chinese toy ( well it's made in china).Keyboard and mouse are extremely soft ..And that's why not at all suitable for gamingCons.Very soft keys .The reciver looks fragile.Slow Out of the box dpi.Pros.Looks great 👍The keys are nicely spacedMouse is very comfortable to hold .Warrenty seems legitVery portableJust require 2AA battery (one for mouse/one for keyboard)Seems durable ( will let you know if it breaks ...I use stuff rough )I would recommend going for Logitech ( costs 500-1000 rs more)But I don't see the point wasting your money ..Overall. .go for it
2,"I bought this for my android tablet and it worked well from day one. I didn't have much complaints but only that neither the keyboard nor the mouse had a power off switch. I used it delicately but the space bar key broke just a month after the purchase. Otherwise, it's a fine product for the price. The mouse has teflon pads for smooth travel on any mousepad. The clicks on both the keyboard and the mouse are a bit wonky but, hey, you get what you pay for. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive as it goes to sleep very soon after you stop using(about 30secs-1 min) and you have to click it twice every time to get it back out of sleep. I'm giving this two stars mainly because of its durability. Everything else is pretty good for the price."
2,"The sleep profile on the mouse is very aggressive. If you switch between typing for sometime and then use the mouse, then the mouse remain unresponsive for couple of seconds until it wakes up. I wish both keyboard andmouse had switches to turn them on/off instead.Keyboard will occasionally miss some keys and might require some force to register keys. Also the shift key is an awkward position located to the right of the arrow up key. Both of these issues could be resolved by using this same keyboard for sometime, but not if you're switching different keyboards all the time.I will not buy this product again only because of the pathetic mouse."
5,The first order I received was a defective one. It dint have proper packing was half open with label on it . I was experiencing severe lags when backspace and some buttons are pressed . Was not able to work with that issues . They don't come with batteries though. It requires normal  AAA  battery . They offered me a replacement one for the lag issue.I loved it 😎It came with the perfect packaging perfectly sealed . And works like charm. So far No issues . Red color is so highlighting compared to the white. My friend has white one.Its a perfect keyboard if ur looking for travel and fits easily in bags .One USB dongle for both keyboard and Mouse has solved my USB slot problem.The keys are sturdy too. The mouse is the best part of this. It's so sleek and makes no noise on clicking .No worries you can feel the pressure of clicking the buttons. It's so silent and responds very well even they share the same dongleYou won't Regret Go For It 💯
1,"I purchased it for my kid for his online school.  Firstly, product was delivered without the batteries. As per contents description it should have been included. Secondly, after few days of use, the mouse has problems connecting to the dongle. The mouse stops responding whereas the keyboard works fine. The return/ replacement policy is already over so cannot get it replaced. I am really unhappy with product. I recommend buy a Dell / HP wireless combos."
4,"the mouse is not so ergonomic they tried to mimic the magic mouse by trying to make it flat. if used for long hours for gaming and stuff causes a little pain as there is not much support on offer.Keyboard is awesome very smooth typing experience with good key travel and spacing. Only drawback is no right control button which is of great use for single handed usage, and the right shift key is very small you end up typing the up arrow a lot so if you use the right shift key then this may not be right for youOverall, a good combo very satisfied battery life of keyboard is good mouse consumed the battery in 2-3 months"
5,"Some Chinese brands still stick to India because of this kind of product. Even lowest price the combo is decent and outstanding.What I liked:Build quality: Feels niceThe size of the keyboard, (11 X 5.5 X 3/4 Inches)Light-weight (350 g)Easy to carry in a daily backpack, laptop bag, office bagSilent keypress (except Spacebar key)Mouse buttons and wheel is really smoothRequired only two AA sized batteryGood wireless range (up to 8 meters I tested and works fine)No visible LASER flash in mouseAuto sleep if being not used for few minutesWhat I didn't like:No button to switch off the mouse or keyboard, If the dongle is attached to my tablet, a slight movement cause wake up the screen.The thing to ignore:Chinese product (I didn't find an alternate)No numerical keyboard, this is a small keyboard that does not have all the keys that you found on a full-size keyboard.Overall Value for money, Compact, Lightweight, must have."
3,"Everything is good except the packaging because the outer carton was damaged & also the batteries were missing as there is a slot inside which means the sellers open the packed products & take out the batteries before they dispatch the product.1.The product feels a bit plasticy but still the manufacturer has used good plastic.2. Buttons are smooth & big in size so I didn't find any problem while typing.3. Mouse is good, no clicking sound which annoys me a lot also it's IR so no red light which is also annoying.4. It's made in China so people who are against Chinese products please don't waste your money but if you consider product & not the country of origin than its a best option you can go with."
4,"Product looks attractive. Also Keyboard is compact in shape. Has nice smoother keys. Only drawback I found was the right hand side Shift key which is very small in size. Hence when if you want to type any capital letter, then it will be little bit difficult since I am used to normal keyboard with large Shift key and hence I dont have to find out the shift key, my finger automatically goes to Shift key. But in this keyboard, due to small size Shift key, It becomes little bit difficult.Otherwise product is really Good. Mouse is extremely good and silent, buttery smooth.One thing I want to mention is that the nano receiver can be found on the backside of mouse, near the  battery compartment."
2,"This was second replacement set I ordered. Keyboard is good undoubtedly.Mouse is the most disappointing. First one I replaced due to mouse intermittent disconnect.Next one also started doing the same. Initially I thought it might be my office laptop not getting compatible. I tried two other different laptop. Guess what! It's a bloody faulty mouse. Before I realised and return the product, the return duration got over 🤦Moreover I could have read previous review before purchase.Found that I'm not the only one.CONCLUSION : Plz don't waste your money. Better go for good brand, rather than this crap brand."
3,"The keyboard key layout will take lot of time to get used to. Best for first timers. Keyboard is too small and layout is very different from standard keyboardsMouse is pretty good and has good ergonomics. Power saving works well.Both are very light weight.However, when I connected the receiver to Monitor USB Port (which is connected via USB Type C), i started seeing too much lag and missing keystrokes. Battery was new. Didn't try connecting to laptop directly."
5,"it doesn't have on/off.  But it goes to sleep on 3 minutes of inactivity.  if you are a hard user of the keyboard, then it's not the right one.  This is a tiny & easily portable keyboard for very light use.  The mouse is perfect the color and precision are completely good.The seller should provide batteries.  which was missing in my case.  Amazon customer care asked for a replacement.  But the package cost for replacement is more than the 2 AA-sized batteries it depends on you to go for a replacement for missing items.It is worth at its cost & I got the blue one for 989/- (batteries missing)"
3,"I have been using this product for over week now. Overall its a OK product. Keys are soft touch but it has some big problems with the key setup on the right -THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY IS HALF SIZED as compared to enter key. For users typing with both hands and having habit of using right shift key, this is highly inconvenient. It is almost impossible to press right shift and middle characters like y, h, n etc.Printscreen is in second last row. They could have skipped some of the worthless keys like right click and made shift key the same size as enter key.Mouse is silent, but the scroll ball has started making some noise when scrolling from bottom to top."
5,"Clicking sould null..i have logitech and protronics mouse..but protonics mouse very less sound almost null..there is no on/off switch but belive me power management is awesome.. just use the mosue when its need after that auto sleep..even after u are playing a video for long and mouse is ideal condition,then after 10-15sec mouse and keypad is sleep mode..awesome one..try it"
1,"I had initially given this 5 star rating but after a month of use, the keyboard has started giving me problems, the keys just remains pressed and the letters keep getting typed at random, say I press letter 'a' once but on the screen it will change to something like 'aaaaaaaaaaaa' and so on. It is become difficult to use the keyboard. I visited the HP website to register the product and enforce the one year warranty that apparently came with the product, but after several attempts all I get is a message that ""Invalid Product Code"" or invalid ""Product Serial No."" which means it is probably not a genuine HP product either"
3,"Pros:- a good deal- BT connectivity is good- easy to set up- mouse is okay and ergonomically feels good- keys are smoothCons- battery that was provided with the purchase was dead and the battery indicator on the keyboard didn't pick it up. I was thinking something was wrong with the connection as the keyboard showed up as connected but wasn't able to connect anything. It took me so much time to figure this out- the top row keys are pretty much useless since the markings are in black, it is really hard to see what is what until you flex your eyes- keyboard feels very compact and most of the times, I mistype. May be I was used to a much broader keyboardNo indicator of number lock and caps lock whatsoever. This leads to lots of mistyping"
4,Its look too big and requires lot of space.Apart from that everything is great its looks slim and mouse is perfect fit in hand.Always buy combo because one USB socket required for both keyboard and mouseIf you buy separate then you need teo USB port for both keyboard and mouse.Go with this HP keyboard and mouse combo
1,Looking at the box made me realise that it's quite old and poorly shipped. Later I checked and could see the side of key board broken.
2,"The Keyboard was really very good, apparently the mouse that came along with this product did not work at all. The Right click was completely out of order. Although I tried to change the settings, only left click was working.Finally within few hours of receiving this product, I had to initiate a return process.HP products are loosing their momentum .... Looks like they have almost run out of steam without much innovations happening."
2,"I would recommend dont buy this product. I was not impressed with the keyboard as the keys are short (though the layout is big) and you don't feel of using the key board. The mouse stopped working and now I need to take it to service centre. In Bangalore, there is only one Service Centre (at Jayanagar) and unfortunately, I have travelled all the way there. I do not recommend this... Prefer to buy these products from some other manufacturer."
3,"Mouse: The finish on the mouse feels cheap. It uses 2 AA batteries which make the mouse very heavy and uncomfortable.Also the mouse use a red visible light which  is not very efficient (that's why 2 cells) and the light shines through the scroll wheel which is blindingly bright ! On-off switc is very cheap amd wont last long.Keyboard: If you are buying it for the multimedia keys, then please don't buy it ! The multimedia keys are not printed so you will find it very hard to tell what key does what. Also the spacebar is horrible ! Feels like a very cheap chinese keyboard. I have to sell it at olx at 650 coz the return period expired.You better off buy Logitech MK270r..."
4,"Had purchased a Dell KM117 wireless keyboard+mouse combo last year. So this is a review comparing both.Keyboard* The keyboard is not exactly compact, but hey, it's a full layout with the number pad, so it's expected to be big.* Keys itself feel like cheap plastic, and a bit wobbly. Can hear kind of a rolling dice sound while lifting the keyboard up! :) Compared to an old HP PS/2 keyboard, these keys feel cheap.* No capslock/scrolllock/numlock LEDs.* People who love a standard QWERTY US-EN layout should be okay with this one. The Dell KM117 keyboard had a better feel to the keys, however it didn't have the right click menu key, Print Screen only with Fn etc.Mouse* Mouse is a decent one - considering the price range. Comparing the Dell/Logitech mice I had used over years, the movement is very smooth.* It also has a CPI button for adjusting the sensitivity.  Could be useful for gamers.* What appeared to be side grips on the photograps are not rubber, it's plastic again.All in all. 4/5. Go for it if you'r looking for a cheap keyboard/mouse combo."
5,This is the best keyboard and mouse. I love it 😘😻😘 If you want to buy slim keyboard and mouse just order this.Mouse is suitable for gaming and normal use and keyboard is awesome😍😍
1,"I got this note inside the packed item, saying mouse is not working and i think someone has returned it with note and amazon sell it to me what a shameful act amazon is selling second hand and defective item and product to its costumers, I think that buying product from amazon is not same now beacause they take money and sell you defective, used, and item which are return by someone due to some defect and now when i am returning it it will go to someone else so be aware.Not expected from amazon and now costomer care servive is also not available so well done amazon you are doing great job by fooling your costumer's Thankyou"
1,"It's the worst piece of keyboard, I have to press so hard a button so that a word gets typed on screen, sometimes it if it gets press easily, it prints the word several times the same letter. Overall the keyboard is not even useful for simple typing. If we perform ctrl+any key (operation) then the keyboard doesn't work at all. I didn't expect this from HP!!! Talking about mouse it's better."
1,"I am revising my rating from bad to crap. This product is not even worth looking at forget about buying it. I would have got a better product from a local gully market. The keys have to be pressed multiple times to work, sometimes at certain angle. My productivity has come down and frustration gone up since I started using this keyboard for my office work. Do not ever buy this product.Earlier review:I had higher expectation from HP. In the process of providing items for lower price, the quality has been compromised. The keys does not feel strong, I can feel the brittleness while typing. Some of the keys have to be pressed hard else doesn't work. I had used a wired keyboard at my office which felt extremely good, hence thought of buying one for personal use. But the wireless version is very bad to say the least. Don't buy this item."
1,The combo is just perfect. Only thing missing is backlight option on keyboard.STOPPED WORKING AFTER WITHIN 4 MONTHS. BETTER BUY WIRED MOUSE KEYBOARD COMBO. ANY WIRELESS ONES ARE UNSTABLE AND SHORT LIFE SPAN.
5,I was looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo for mainly my office work. And I've found the perfect product. This was the only product listed that had a full size chiclet keyboard and mouse with different dpi. This combo jas helped my work desk being less cluttered with cables and the look of both devices is very subtle.Only two things I was not a fan of were that first the scroll wheel could have been a little free and it would be better if the mouse didn't have any light feels gimmicky to me.Otherwise an excellent product.
2,Bought this unit in Sept 2020. The mouse stopped working and did not connect after 1 month of use and the keyboard also developed a manufacturing defect and the hyphen key (not used often) is getting pressed on its own. The product is useless and has a cheap design and feel. Not recommended.
5,Please go for this product without any second thought. Its a really a great product and i have used for few months and the performance and usage is best.I will recommend for all WFH users to reduce there nerve compression issues just in case if you are using laptop keyboard.Rather get one monitor + this keyboard and mouse.5 star product
5,"Frankly, I was actually have second thoughts reading all negative feedback about this keyboard but there was something about its awesome looks that made me buy it anyway..i hope it works as awesomly as it is working now. Feels good while typing. Doesn't make much sound.Mouse and Keyboard are connected with just 1 USB adaptor"
1,"Ctrl key stop working after 9 days of purchase, I am looking for replacement of the product but the replacement time period (which is very limited 10 days) has expired. @Amazon please stop selling #Fake products, if it is not Fake give me #Replacement. If i don't get replacement i will stop using Amazon and will start with Flipcart."
3,"Does the job. Works with both mac and windows, although you need to remember key combinations for mac. It is more of a looker than a productive/functional device.Caps lock indiacator would've be perfect but again, does the job. Keys are okay.Mouse too is okay, but I occassionally face issues with reception when I have other bluetooth or metal surfaces on the desk.Haven't found anything else at this price point that works with both mac and windows."
2,Although the keyboard is of good quality I had a hard time with the mouse. If it goes to sleep and you try to use it again there seems to be an issue. To resolve this I have to remove the batteries and put it back. Even that doesn't work sometime and I have to repeat it until you see the light fully come on.I would not recommend this product for the price point it is at currently. Really disappointed by the poor quality from HP
5,"the key board click is very nice as user experience is very nice,.  the mouse is too good  no issue such as latency or lag. everything is smooth and perfect.  hotkeys at the top is very much help full in playback control. yes, this review is after 20 days of use . its nice and build quality is also decent .  bought it for 1300 INR.  go fr it .  hope useful :)"
2,Keys are having some issues. It gets stuck in pressed position which affects duplicate characters in your documents and code. With this price and with this defect its not worth buying. Thickness is comfortable to use.
2,"I'm having nightmare with poor battery. The keyboard is powered with just 1 AAA battery, so response is slow, hangs a lot. Mouse has 2 AAA battery still response is very slow, even with Duracell alkaline battery overall performance is very poor. Highly disappointed with HP"
1,"TOTAL WASTE1. Keyboard doesn't have any LED indication for Caps Lock, Num Pad or Scroll Lock2. It interfers with 2.4GHz WiFi. Have to get another wired keyboard and mouse.Feel cheated, as there was no disclaimer about the possible interference."
1,Battery life is just 24 hours and your battery will die. I have used nippo which was used by me for 3 working days (8hour shift) and in Duracell it's 5 days max.Don't buy the product supplier won't reply you.
4,"Best productLight weightBest qualityEasy to clean,easy to installFastAll are offsomeBut*There is a littile screen in lop right corner,i dont know what is that for,*I didn't like the metal brush designBut it is better for some one elseOther keyboard has more drawback than this so this was best option"
1,"keyboard keys doesnt work properly.-> at times prints alphabet multiple times. use backspace to delete extra chars.-> most of the times need to press the ctrl and shift keys harder-> at times prints alphabets after a delay (few seconds)keys are messed up. it is frustrating to use.I thought it will increase my productivity, alas it is doing more harm than good.stopped using it."
1,"My most of the work is done in ms excel and involves lots of short cut keys like copy paste, select row columns.. and it is so annoying that these  doesn't work properly.. ctrl key won't most of the time... and after a month LHS SHIFT button does not work 90% of the time and you need to struggle using the keyboard if you use most of the short cut keys while working on MS Excel."
5,"Value for money, keyboard keys feels amazing while typing does not make much noise like other keyboards and mouse works smooth like butter. No complaints at all. Also, mouse has a compartment to place the receiver so it doesn’t get lost. Lastly, mouse turns off itself after 8 minutes to save battery. You can wake the mouse by just a click. Overall worth the money you are paying."
2,"IN FACT, I WANTED TO BUY ONE COMPACT LIGHTWEIGHT BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD-MOUSE COMBO FOR  i-PAD, i.e. IOS COMPATIBLE. BUT THIS ONE IS ONLY WINDOWS COMPATIBLE AND USEFUL FOR PC OR LAPTOPS. THEREAFTER I TRIED FOR EXCHANGING IT WITH ONE COMPATIBLE WITH IOS. BUT AMAZON VERY TACTFULLY GAVE ME A SINGLE OPTION TO EXCHANGE IT ONLY WITH THE SAME PRODUCT!"
1,"It get disconnected while working if you just give a 2 mins gap. You have to click on something to activate it again. Which can be frustrating while you are at work. And also top multimedia buttons are not visible, so you see the buttons but don't know their function until you bend your head towards them and look keenly. I'd recommend Dell wireless. Dell keyboard works great have no issues with it. Been using for more than one year."
2,"While  using this item, some are cons.& some are pros.Cons:- 1) Design is good  2) Proper packing on delivery time  3) Arrival on time  4) slick designpros:- 1) defective  item received for first time return process easy and another piece in just 2 days  2) For 2 days is working fine now  in key 8th key in num.  right section is not pressing while pressing any other key  automatically press. This Piece is also faulty.."
2,Mouse : Silent and smooth .Key board : Average. No indicators provided for CapsLock and NumLock. Multimedia buttons may be little larger.  Battery indicator is not working.
3,1. I  have used logitech brand. and found better in just Rs 1200 . I bought it in Rs 14992. I took it after watching functions and review specifically brand name HP. But disappointed after seeing its AAA batteries which were leaking and very old( totally drained). Not expected with HP brand.3. Overall good but found little bit costly also I had to add Rs 54 for 03 in Nos duracell AAA size to use.
1,"Ordered two for my daughters, one was faulty and mouse was not working, ordered for replacement, looks like vendour is still not giving a new delivery date, if not interested please refund and take the return."
1,"Mouse was not supplied with keyboard, neither the USB..."
1,"1) no led buttons to notify about capslock/numlock etc you are the mercy of guess while entering passwd.2) keyboard has high debounce issue3) mouse is not smooth, sometimes needs multiple moves.Overall looks like a low cost chinese product pretty much unlike HP product. Its like you get what you pay for. Better to invest a bit more and get a good product. This might not survive for few months."
5,"Im full fledge software engineer heavy duty on keyboards and mouse, so it may be an reason it only took 3 months to replace keyboard and mouse battery.But as far as confort and way this keyboard is designed is awesome.Its a complete value for money, I recommand this keyboard only thing is battery backup.Company please look into this issue, either make extra battries for keyboard and mouse find another solutions. Thanks"
2,The keyboard actually takes lot of space in length. I realized while working I had to stretch my right hand more to reach out to the mouse. This started causing pain and so I had to return it after one day of use.
1,"I bought this products and after a months its stop working  and service centre refuse to give warranty because serial no not mentioned on amazon invoice.More than 10times i called to amazon but response are worst every time.I highly recommend you all , Don’t buy at least Electonics from amazonCustomer’s service are worst. Hate it"
2,"I m writing this review fter using the 'Quantum QHM7307 Mini Keyboard' for lmost three months. s you cn see for yourself, some lphbet keys hve stopped working in the lst three months. So tht speks for the qulity.The keybord mkes lot of noise while typing nd it is not smooth. The 'Print Screen' key is missing.  I will not recommend this product. Now  I hve to tke the keybord to the service centre for repir.Feb 13, 2020Update: After using it for three months, few keys were stopped working. When I contacted the seller, they asked me to get in touch with the company (Quantam) directly who in turn directed me to their service centre for repair. Since the product was under warranty, they replaced the keyboard. Thank you so much.Mar 11, 2020"
1,"I had ordered for a replacement and they sent me a surprise. :) Both times I received a opened unit.The Good :-  Small sizeThe Bad:- 1. Poor material, 2. Loose dancing like keys specially the spacebar, 3. Small Arrow keysLast but not the least I don't know why I made so many typing mistake using the keyboard, two keys are pressed together many a times. And this could be my issue as well."
4,"I'm using this product for quite a while, and it stands right.# small and portable.# full function key strip.#durable.# some what splash proof.There is not much to talk about it works and acts as the alternative keyboard.But there is no dedicated number pad on this.Overall the product is feel average and works well."
1,"Plz READ BEFORE BUYING!!!I tried to use it by plugging in and when I start typing, it starts to open pages, random tabs in chrome, downloading anything on any website. Jumping through the whole system without getting a single key out from the keyboard. Like u type ok = it will download chrome websites or open any kind of tabs.  After I unplugged the keyboard. My system got hangged, I had to restart and force stop the keyboard driver then it starts to work normally. It's such a troublemaker, I was nearly loosing my system. SO BEWARE FROM THIS PRODUCT!! IM BETTER OFF WITH OLD LOGITECH KEYBOARD! u were killing my system, the hell's up with that ???"
5,Every aspect is Good including it's size .It is a True Value for Money . Very comfortable to press keys.
5,The main purpose for buying this keyboard was to destory this through hardcore gaming. The reason for selecting this one is  it's small size and light weight which is quite suited for my gaming laptop and my workspace and also that i can carry it where i want.And also the package was not so good... it's worst!!ProS:1. It is cheal if the current one destoryed you can go for  another one with out worries.2. It's small when compared with other keyboards at this rate.3. The keys are quite clicky and recognisable.4. Weight is Light as feather.5. Nice and good key spacing.ConS:1. Build feels quite local and not so good.2. USB Cord is not braided and reasonably long.3. Should be handled with care.Conclusion: If you want an secondary keyboard so that you don't want to spoil your precious laptop keyboard sure you can go for it. And also it light and small and looks great. But it will not be durable however it's acceptable due to its low cost!!.
5,"This is a fantastic external keyboard. It's softer and smoother than my Vaio and HP laptop built-in keyboards, and as good as my Dell Inspiron keyboard. I've used Frontech external keyboard last 6 months and its keys are so hard & get stuck that I needed to type with such a force, which left me with extreme pain in shoulders and arms!But this one is a Godsent to me - it's just feather-touch!"
4,"Its a good product, but a little bit smaller than what I expected. The key however, are more in height so one need to put some effort to press the key. This may be because in the laptop we use chick-let key board that has keys with lower height. However, after a while the fingers get used to it. I used it a few times. The keyboard is actually quite a value for money and easy going. Good product to be used in crucial times when your laptop or computer is kept at a distance and you want to type...............this keyboard really has a long lead.Thanks"
5,Really super compact keyboard. Buttons are smooth and comparably equal quality of Logitech.
3,"Summary: Overall, it's an okay keyboard that allows you to get the work done. But be ready to sacrifice on the productivity, since it doesn't feel ""at home"" to use.Details:SIZE: is almost same as 15.6 inch laptops' main keyboard. I will attach some photos later. I kept mistyping and had to go back to correct everything. Looking down at the keyboard while typing helped and I was able to type without errors, albeit at a reduced rate. Quite obviously, keys are spaced differently than on a standard 15.6 inch notebook keyboard. One of the photos I have attached shows its size compared to a HP 15.6 inch notebook keyboard.Typing experience: It's not as good as silent notebook's buttery smooth built-in keyboard, but that is to be expected at this price point. I wouldn't say the typing experience is terrible (considering the price), but a little smoother keys could make things better. The keys on this are good but slightly ""felt"" despite being noiseless. This review is primarily typed on this keyboard itself, though I had to correct it quite often.Key layout: The main keyboard is almost perfect, but many other keys are hard to use (assigned non-standard functions). Listing them all here would not be possible but I can highlight some. Many of the keys such as F11, F12 behave entirely differently than on the notebook keyboard. The same story for most other Fn Keys. That's the story at least compared to a HP notebook running Linux. The experience may be slightly better with other notebooks/OSes but some inconvenience/learning curve is guaranteed.Some reviews that complained about ""mistyping"" are actually a misunderstanding on the part of the user. Actually, by default the ""Num Lock"" state in ""ON"". Which means that some keys on the main keyboard are designed to type numerals by default rather than the alphabet. Though a little documentation could have helped, but as usual with low priced China made stuff, this comes with no documentation.Default keys typed:qwerty456-asdfgh123zxcvbn0Same keys typed with Num Lock turned off:qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmMultimedia keys: Only 3 multimedia keys worked for me: MUTE, VOLUME UP, VOLUME DOWN. None of the other multimedia keys worked for me.Key press order: is slightly different from built-in keyboard. For example: To effect a <Ctrl+End> you must type in <Ctrl+Fn+Right Arrow>. If you change the order it will be treated as <Fn+Right Arrow> ignoring the <Ctrl> key.The keyboard I was sent was was soiled, scuffed, dirty. Sending back for replacement.At its usual price (Rs 400-500) it's expensive. It's fair price should be under Rs 300."
5,"it creates short circuit to the computer and that leads to ""no signal"" error. this is very strange issue i faced. i struggled alot to find out root cause, whenever i switched on it go to ""no signal"" error and shutdown. i tried change the monitor, motherboard, vga port and hdmi port, graphics card port etc., finally found that no signal issue due to this key board. worst...other users also faced the same issue, check in reviews."
3,"This is great while it works. It's flat chiclet, very light, very small, and can fit into tight spaces. Doesn't require battery. The chiclet prevents wear on your fingers from going up and down, so it has some ergonomic advantages. Those are the good points.It's not great ergonomically, as it's very small (forces your hands/arms together unnaturally). Having a split keyboard that allows your arms to be their natural distance apart all day is better.Bigger deal - after 18 months, this stopped working. Keyboard press generated wrong/random character. This has no batteries and a different cable didn't fix it; nothing I can do with it. I have similar keyboard from multiple vendors (Artek, Quantum) which stopped working and failed in similar fashion after same period of time. Can't help thinking they're OEMing the same board. Very weird."
5,My laptop keyboard stopped working due to liquid spillage and replacement was not worth it. So I went in for a mini keyboard.  This one is the best.  It is compact as well as comfortable to use.  Does not have numeric keybad as in standard 101 key PC keyboard but that is not required and that would increase width. Good buy. Working fine since last few months.
3,"What I loved about this keyboard is the small size & the fact that I could carry it anywhere and everywhere. After a month or two of using it almost daily though, the wire connecting the keyboard to the laptop/ PC has come off and the keyboard isn't useable anymore. I don't know if it's a quality issue overall or with my particular piece but the keyboard is just useless now.I feel sad and sorry that it happened. Till the time it worked though, it worked flawlessly. It was comfortable to use for hours and was so easy to carry around. Sad that it's of no use anymore. 😔"
5,It's a good keyboard. Easy to type. It's a bit small so some people might find it uncomfortable. But i liked it ... Can keep it on any surface even on the bed. The wire is just the correct length for meJust another update ... I spilled paisam on the keybaord and it still works without any issues
4,"Compact design. Works fine but the keys are noisy. Cable length is fine, quality is okay according to price."
1,"why is quantum manufacturing such unbelievably sub standard product pls . pls live up to your equity  in the market folks, this is just not acceptable  Quantum & it doesnt allow me to write this review as well & starts typing all the special characters on its own. serious driver issues pls fix it asap , else pls dont sell  fool around consumers pls, my earnest submission to quantum"
4,"Bought this keyboard a month or so ago. I was a bit skeptical before buying. However the product is good.It is compact in size and the feel of the keys on the keyboard is also good. It's a bit bouncy and spongy, not very clicky kind of. If you like that kind of feel, you will like this keyboard.At this price point you cannot really complain. All in all a good budget product."
1,"I am writing this feedback as to when I bought the keyboard on 12th April , today on 30th April the keyboard is typing 6 instead of O and 4 instead of U , not only that 0 key has gone deaf , the keyboard is so unresponsive, this keyboard doesn't even deserve to be sold for the scam it does, it is 350 rupees down the drain.DONT BUY THIS KEYBOARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE LAST OPTION YOU HAVE"
5,"This keyboard is really small and light weight...I'm using this for 2days and it's working fine... Although, it doesn't have backlight but the alphabet stickers are glossy so you can see in dark with the help of your monitor light by the reflection...I liked it"
1,"Bought it on 24 January 2021 in Rs349. It is working fine and everything as per description. Mac does not recognise some of the keys in this keyboard though. It may be because, it is non standard sized small keyboard.Keys are smooth, non noisy.Update on 3 October 2021:It worked well for the first few months but then it started to shut down my laptop for some reason, whenever I plugged it in, my laptop went to sleep mode. Checked in other laptop too, it too shut down in 5 minutes plugged in. I want claim warrenty."
1,DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH. I bought this keyboard a week ago and already started malfunctioning.Keys wont register or they would register a number when clicking an alphabet. I made a replacement request and amzon was quick with that so props to them vut the replacement unit was trash too same issues out of the box .I REPEAT DONT BUY THIS KEYBOARD IT IS ABSOLUTE TRASH
1,I purchased this keyboard to use on my Laptop as there was a need. The keyboard worked very well for 2 months and after that keys are not working correctly. The keys ;lkj gives a numeric output and there is no way to change it. I have tried to uninstall and re-install the device. I have also tried to disable the ports and use another port. It's not any issue with ports but the keyboard itself. There is no specific drivers for this model on Quantum webpage. There is no option for replacement as well. I am very disappointed :-(
2,"This is not a good product or not a bad product either. For the price, I could use a bit more quality plastic. There is a awful smell come from the keyboard plastic. The keys are not very good, they are mussy and not a very good tactile feedback .on the other hand what you could ask from a 415/- keyboard. For the price point my only issue is the plastic quality and the smell of the plastic. Otherwise it's a good keyboard for it's price point."
3,"Compact but not so friendly as it was for me. As it lacks some of the keys which I have experienced with my previous mini keyboard Technotech.I really don't like ""Fn"" Keys."
5,This is a compact keyboard that I have used almost for a year and is working fine. I am using an keyboard tray and you need a compact keyboard to fit both mouse and keyboard on the tray. It is good ergonomics!
1,"I bought this Keyboard 4 months back  it was light, compact, and easy carry & working fine. After my 4 months of very Moderate usage, keyboard started troubling me when i press 'A' Letter in the keyboard in display it is showing '$' Dollar symbol.I thought it Driver Issue and re installed drivers but there is no use., Again I had connected to another PC But the same issue repeated again.Please Don't go for this Low quality keyboard and waste your Valuable Money !!!!!!!!!"
4,"Keyboard is compact. It does lift up using semi-cylindrical shaped underbody. Keys provide good feedback, does not  require too much pressure and travel distance is nice. (Far better than laptops). But keys do make a noise. They make more noise upon realising than after pressing.(laptops keys are much quieter). So if you are planning to buy it for classes or lectures then it might disturb others. Go for it if you want to crush it for gaming or typing or if you use external monitor. It has number pad integrated with alphabets.Works well with Android phones as well (using type c OTG adapter. Tested with OnePlus 5t in Evernote app. You might need to turn on OTG from mobile settings.)"
1,"This keyboard is handy and comfortable for typing. But The fact is sometimes all buttons not working goodly. If you click one button, it will give you another output and so many characters will be printed. If I had -5 star rating, I would give that.The main fact is when I plugged in the keyboard, my laptop gets turn off. Then I tried with other laptops, same results came again and again. I tried to fix that problem in a different way. But it didn't work. I am writing this product review after using approximately two months.So, I am highly recommending all of you, don't buy this product anymore."
3,"It is the perfect sized keyboard very similar to a Dell laptop keyboard size. However quality leaves a lot to be desired. Keys get stuck and keep repeating and as a result delays the typing experience. Also the keys themselves feel very light weight and flimsy. I am a touch typist and love my Dell / Lenovo laptop keyboards and was hoping for the same although at a lesser price. Unfortunately was disappointed. Also there is no ""return"" option , so have opted for a replacement. will update this review in case the replacement product is a better quality one."
1,"didn't even use it for a month when it started giving problems, the keys don't work properly, key traversal is horrible. I now have zero faith in quantum hi-tech products and I strongly recommend everyone not to buy their products and instead invest more wisely. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,"This product didn't meet my expectations, I placed the order and then i have to oreder for replacement but the product didn't work again and then i have to return the product. This is the first time i was not happy with the product. But replacement and return was so smooth Thumps up 👍 for the service."
5,"As expected, go ahead and buy. Good one."
3,"I am writing this review after one day of usage. The keyboard is very good specially if you have a small desk but the packing in which it came was very poor, there was no protective foams at all. The keyboard’s packet was just wrapped in some ordinary thin plastic... I thought the keyboard would be broken on arrival but luckily its not, amazon should look carefully into this. I wanted to give it 5 stars but because of packing I am giving it 3 three stars. Overall the keyboard is good, go for it."
1,"Decent USB Keyboard for occasional useUPDATE - Stopped working after 6 months. Although there is 1 year warranty on paper it is of no use. When i contacted QuantumHiTech was told to find a local service center. The nearest one is 15kms away and when i was visited was told we are not accepting any warranty items today and i should plan to revisit after 2 - 3 days. I checked if there is an option to send my courier due to covid travel restrictions but was told there isn't any such option, which to me means atleast 3 - 4 visits to service center."
1,Worstest purchase I ever did. It stopped working within 2 days and the customer care service of the brand is really bad they just randomly said a name of a service center and the service Center doesn't even repair keyboard. They just denied. The brand is keep me waiting for 2 weeks. Now also they don't have any answer just ask to wait will inform later....if you don't have good service facility stop sales through out India just focus on your street
3,"ProsGreat price point. Does the job well.Compact size.ConsWithin a few weeks, you'll find loose contact in usb port. You have to frequently adjust the usb plug. Becomes a big pain. I'm planning to buy a wireless keyboard instead.While sound made by keys is not bad, definitely not a ""quiet keyboard"".Overall, okaish product. But as I said, at this price range, don't expect more."

4,RGB is amazing different modes 🤩 build quality is op comparing with cosmic bite this is best
4,the thing is this the best for minecraft or gtaits good 9/10 but the delivery went late.
5,This us my first keyboardIn the life and this was excelente
5,GOOD
5,It is very nice prodect because it's Rambo lighting
5,Awesome product
4,It’s day 2 !!!! Enough adjustable  brightness…lots of lighting styles…multimedia keys…can visible in day light….windows lock key…caps/num lock indicator….good for gaming or regular users too.. character print & build quality compromised… but  Damn satisfied …let’s see 🧐how will work for long… will update …paisa vasool hai ki nahi😋
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It’s pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It’s very satisfying to type on and if you’re looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It’s a one time investment that’ll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
4,"I was seeing these types of keyboards all over the internet mainly on channels of abroad youtubers and i really wanted to try the retro typewriter style keyboard and i came across this. I absolutely loved it and its very smooth and aesthetic  in work. One thing that i would like to say to the other customers is that the cells in the keyboard is packed so you have to unpack then and then place them to make it work. And when bot in use for a couple of hours, pull out the usb drive and keep it back at its place. I struggled a little at the start because i didnt know the cells were packed. Anyways, hope this review helps you!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,"Cool product, better than regular keybrds. Although the blue one looks like green one to me. I think its a must have for whosoever wants a wireless keybrd and mouse. All keys and mouse also is very comfortable and very smooth to operate. Comes with batteries also. This piece is a design innovation and worthy of an award."

5,"The product I received was in very good condition. Packaging is also great. The batteries come pre installed but make sure to remove the plastic covering from the batteries. It's easy to set up, just plug in and you are good to go. The quality of keys also feels nice and damp."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
3,Just ok no option for tilt. print on keys r like stickers not printed small then normal size keyboard caps lock light not bright battery indicator don’t work just ok not like pictures
5,Best ever in keyboard I used in my life. I'm totally satisfied. Thanks Amazon for the deal. A1Product. 5/5 from me. Mouse is also best. Excellent experience I feel using this product.
1,"Physical appearance of the keyboard and designs goods. However, when you are using it, it’s not comfortable as as compare to normal keyboard. I have been using Lenovo keyboard from 2016 and did not faces any issue.While using this, i am getting pain in wrist and fingers"
1,"Box was open when I recieved it, the keyboard has scratches on it. If i am paying 2750 for a keyboard then the least I can expect is a seal packed new product instead of a used one."

1,I am writing the review after using it for 1 months. Keys have become unresponsive already. I work in IT and bought this 1 month ago as i loved the look and feel of the keyboard for my WFH setup. Before this i was using a Wired and Wireless Dell Keyboard for 2 years and never had issues with them. I think i started regretting the decision already.
3,Look wise performance it was good. But only for hime purposes. For IT Employees not that much efficient. Keys are like type writer keys. Fast typing is not possible.
1,"Its hard to type, though the keys are smooth .. but have to press deeperand possibility of pressing wrong key is very frequent.I don't recommend this keyboard for a person who's job needs continuos typing thoughout the day.Looks pretty, material is good but NOT Recommended :(Couldn't use more than a week."

5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it’s one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I’m glad I choose the green. It’s very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It’s worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
2,"I was very excited to receive this product. But as soon as I unpacked and connected with my Mac, the keyboard stopped working. I had to return the product.So sad. Was really looking forward to this product.Look & Feel - Very cuteTyping - Easily manageable"
5,"It's so awesome, and affordable. Just gives the feeling as real as of typewriter 😃 , and ASMR😇😌😍... Just fell in ❤love wid this cute thing 🥰😋.... One more thing of consideration You have to buy a OTG cable if you have a tab, so get it as well."
5,"It's a value for money , build quality is good , i usually keep my other keyboards in slanting position while typing this one holds really perfectly ,typing experience is really awesomeI dont play games much ,so , I may not be able to give any review regarding gaming"
4,"The finishing is beautiful . Suits my aesthetic 🤩 The only cons are that it is very easy to type the wrong key and there is no swtich off button...i guess by unplugging the usb, it automatically switches off. But i would have preferred it to have a separate switch off button"
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ☺️"

2,"A month after receiving the wireless keyboard, the switch on the keyboard has started malfunctioning. The keyboard now works very erratically.I am unable to carry it the very long distance to the Logitech service centre in Andheri-East as I have a spinal fracture. So, to me this product has been a write off of the money spent. Logitech should not incorporate the switch on the keyboard. It is a component that is most likely to malfunction on switching it on and off every day. Can Amazon help me with a replacement?"
1,"KEY BOARD PARTIALLY STOPPED WORKING IN 15 DAYS... MANY OF THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING ONLY MOUSE IS WORKING , WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS SERVICE CENTRE IS 40KMS FROM MY PLACE NERUL TO GOREGAON ... SO FOR ME ITS LIKE AFTER GOING WITH BEST AVAILABLE KEYBOARD COMBO IM LEFT WITH MOUSE ONLY CAUSE ITS NOT PRACTICALY POSSIBLE TO GO 40KMS IN MUMBAI JUST FOR KEYBOARD ..."
5,"Great product.Pros1. On off switch on keyboard and mouse2. Caps lock indicator3. Shortcut keys like calculator sound etc4. Nano receiver5. Compartment inside mouse to hold nano receiver.6. Spill resistant,  has pockets beneath so that water that enters can drain out easily.7.Keys need very soft touch.Cons ( Not a big issue though)1. No num lock indicator2. Mouse slightly small than averageGo for it.Nice product. I got for 1499 in lightning deal."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size. Spill proof feature and the extra key rows on top are the best part of it. The keays are placed in a flat tray which has few small wholes under it to drain out the liquid, if accidentally some falls on the keyboard. Top key rows idea includes some dedicated keys for shut down, calculator, media keys etc.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent with an on/off button just like the keyboard, though its a bit small in size as compared to other normal sized mice. But, I think, its not a big issue, as you will get accustomed to it in a day or two.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
1,"The Ordered product is different from the received one. We ordered key board with mouse, along with battries. ""Logitech MK270r Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Wireles...."". And the amazon standard packaging is aslo not there. We received simply the logitech cartoon normal taped on the both the ends, resulted broken keys in this wrong product. suggestion to the seller and the amazon, Please try to improve these. I have returned to replace the same ordereded product. let me see what they are going to send."
1,"Clearly, there was a clarification that this is a Logitech UNIFYING technology. The reality was that it was not. The biggest problem is that it does not allow me to return the product. Only an exchange. I do not want this product since it does not have the Unifying feature. I still do not know know to return this product and I am struggling, as of now. This is a highly overpriced product."
4,"Before saying anything, here is the list of pros and cons:Pros:1. Build Quality, Looks sturdy, and premium.2. Keyboard's keys are soft to press, good for typing.3. The range is great (About 6-7 feet in my case).4. KB and Mouse both have On/Off Key.5. The keyboard has a Caps Lock Indicator.6. The mouse has an invisible optical sensor that means more battery life.Cons:1. The mouse is so small if you compare it with other brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo2. The price is a little high.3. Battery compartment cover on KB and mouse are a little bit loose.(But it's not like they will open by themself. Not a deal-breaker)So the overall package is good and you can definitely buy it. Just remember that the mouse size is a little smaller than the regular one. So if you have a big palm like me, you have to adjust to it but you will get used to of it."
4,"I wanted a full size keyboard to carry in my laptop bag. Most compact keyboards have the layout like laptops i.e. mini arrow keys and cornered page up/down keys, which is illogical because who would buy a separate keyboard which is EXACTLY the same as the laptop's keyboard?Hence I bought this Logitech one which was at a discount in a lightning deal. The keyboard buttons are super smooth, once you press a key gently there is no friction and the key will be pressed all the way down, typing is so much fun with it. Although it is a full size keyboard, it is still a little say 10% smaller than a normal PC keyboard, hence I can easily fit it in my laptop bag.Both the mouse and keyboard use a common nano receiver, earlier I had a wireless Dell mouse and I didn't want to insert two separate usb receivers for both keyboard and mouse, this logitech combo serves that purpose perfectly.There are batteries provided in both of these but they are normal AA ones, I replaced them will Duracell AA cell immediately on unboxing.NOTE: I ALMOST RETURNED this product because I COULDN'T FIND the nano receiver initially. It was supposed to be inside the mouse, near the battery but it wasn't there, the receiver was inserted inside a corner piece of the cardboard outer box, there is no indication on the box where to find it, luckily I found it before I clicked on the final return button."
1,"I'm unable to write much about the product because I received it broken. Out of the box, One key on the keyboard was out. Clearly the packaging and handling was the issue.It wasn't packed in an Amazon package. The box was just wrapped with plastic wrap. I could see the impressions of keys on the plastic cover of keyboard. It must have been under other heavy stuff. I'm returning this!Giving 1 star because of the pathetic packaging and handling. Otherwise, the product gives a nice first impression. Quick word after 5mins usage- both keyboard and mouse look good and top-row multimedia keys work good for calculator, play/pause, volume etc. 1 con though- the mouse wheel doesn't give a nice feedback, bit greecy."
1,"I opened the package 3 days ago and initially for a few hours the keyboard and mouse worked erratically. The next day the performance became worse, to the extent that I cannot work on the keyboard or mouse at all. While typing on keyboard, the characters appear on the screen after a lag of a few seconds, and then too incomplete.Unfortunately for me, the return window is not open anymore even if I used the product for only 3 days.I used to consider Logitec a premium rand, but now I have lost faith in all Logitec products. Complete waste of money.Complete waste of money"
1,"I purchased this product based on amazon suggestion. Initial product delivery was in damaged condition, so I have requested replacement, they replaced the new one today on 2020-06-17, but all the keys are not functional. I have attached the keyboard test as well to show how many keys are defective.When I buy product on amazon, I trust that amazon delivers best, but this is very disappointing, I expect product should be top notch and in perfect working condition. Hope you will take care of it from the next time."
1,"DO NOT BUY this model. It was good initially, but as days progressed, keys have become hard. Only if you hit the keys hard, you will see the letter getting typed on the screen. Support? Warranty? Dont get fooled. Support phone number given in the website says ""Switched Off"". No Support or Warranty at all. Logitech fooled me big time. Ordered two for my office and both are giving me problems."
1,Worst keyboard ever used i thaught logitech is the best productbi can use as iam using a wired logitech mouse for more than 4years i baught it two month back on amazon sale after few days it stoped responding after some time same with the wireless mouse so i asked helpnin amazon so the help and refund returnable was for only 10days so last two days back i went to logitech service and respond is worst they replaced it with new but still am facing the same issue it stops responding after sometime even after changing the batteries
5,"Though I don't like the curvy design, but the product is working fine. No connectivity issue. Mouse is small for a big palm like me.. at first I purchased Amkette Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo which has all the functions like all the indicators and a big mouse, but the mouse had connectivity issue and I had to return that. This Logitech combo has only Caps lock indicator but is working fine. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,This is a very nice combo of wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered it from Amazon a few months ago and I am loving it.  Keyboard are nice and soft you will feel like that you are typing on a Laptop. The keys are very comfortable to use. The mouse is perfect with  Nice respond to the commandBoth On and off buttons are provided on both the keyboard and about and they work immediately after turning them on.There is no delay in the commands.  Go to keyboard and the mouse are active and fast to respond I love this product thanks Logitech for creating such an amazing  Logitech for creating such an amazing home combo🥰
1,"It looks good, easy to carry and sturdy... But all that is worthless if the connection to the computer (or any other device) is bad....The dongle must be in line of sight for the mouse and the keyboard, else you experience a serious amount of lag. I ve tried changing the batteries to new ones and the problem still existsThis is what disappoints me..."
1,"After Missing the USB Chord on 1st order, when I replace, it is found that the arrow key of the keyboard is displaced to very far near 'A' button without unsealed the keyboard . Do you think it will ask for a rating ?"
1,"Does not type Upper Case K, P, D, & many letters. To type P we have to first type lowercase p and then replace that with uppercase P. Strange errors. Even after updating the software it wont become better. Updating is very difficult. The update software does not recognize that it is connected, even though it is connected. Strange keyboard of low quality. Local firms produce keyboards at cheaper price & of better quality."
1,"Logitech mk270r wireless keyboard mouse comboBought with very high expectations.1. The packaging was damaged as gou can see in image i attached.2. package seems to be already opened, batteries were already installed. One extra AA Battery installed in the mouse (not mentioned in package)3. mouse was already in ON mode with Aa battery installed.4. LEFT CTRL key was in the package  instead of being on the KB.5. ENTER key on the number pad is placed in reverse as  seen in image6. one battery installed in KB with other one and KB battery Cover lying loose in the package.7. The indicators in KB (caps lock), and mouse does not seem to light up.8. The USB RECEIVER missing from its place inside the mouse. so couldn't check whether working or not.didn't expect this from amazon. could have got the same from reliance digital delivered at almost the same price from the nearest outlet.Anyways applied for a replacement (as the product seems to be non returnable. shall update my review after i get the replacement."
5,- Soft keys press like butter- long battery backup 2 years for the keyboard and 8 months for mouse daily usage 8-9 hours except for sunday I'm using the same set of the keyboard since 2014 it's my next purchase.- No lag in connectivity also you can use when you connect your television operate from sofa :)- Robust build but bit cheap plastic compare to 2014 purchased model- If you want to use for office or home this one is perfect- The mouse is very handy medium size not too big or smallI'm rating this 8.5 out of 10
1,"Decided to return the product within few minutes of receiving it, for the following reasons.1. Both keyboard and mouse were very noisy..just can't bear the taka taka noise. Not only disturbs my concentration but I do a lot of Skype meetings in WFH mode and its extremely annoying for the paticipants on other side. 2. The pictures are bit deceptive, both mouse and keyboard are small. Keyboard width is ok, but the height is too small and I felt uncomfortable to use it. Prior to this I was using Dell KM 113, soft and no noise, working fine since Jan 2016, it has extra space at the bottom row of ky to rest hands comfortably, just that i needed extra USB slot for separate mouse, hence ordered this combo set.3. Mouse came defective ot of the box, light was not working.4. This feedback for Amazon seller, they sent me the item in a huge cartoon, which could easily fit a 32"" TV or 20-30 keyboard sets, see pic. Not sure what was the reason for such a huge cartoon, waste of resources and extra burden on ligistics."
5,"After 6 years, I've finally changed from my wired Microsoft keyboard to this wireless Logitech keyboard and this is my reviewPACKAGING: The packaging was good. It came in the Amazon plastic bag and had no cracks in it. The product reached me safe.KEYBOARD: My last keyboard had so much dust in them that they had stuck buttons which could not be easily pressed. This keyboard is like a blessing to my hands. The moment I switched to this keyboard, the keys felt so light to touch and has nearly no noise in them. The keyboard is large and keys are spaced right so that you don't mistype any keys. Also, the keyboard has a good alignment setting stands which makes it easier to type. The keyboard can be carried easily while traveling. It comes with 2 AAA batteries which promises to last 36mnths. The connection is strong and it works from every corner of the house. However, do not plan to use it for gaming as it's made only for office work/day to day activites.MOUSE: The mouse is great too. It's compact and lightweight and can fit most hands easily. My hands are a little big so I felt uncomfortable at the start but later it felt fine. The mouse response is good and there's no lag in response. Also, the buttons are easy to click and the wheel rotates smooth. However, they make click noise a lot. The mouse has a AAA battery in it which lasts 18mnths (per company). It also has a storage area for receiver.PRICE: I think the price is justified as you get 2 items for this price. An individual keyboard or mouse would cost you a lot.VERDICT: I think the keyboard is a must buy if you're planning to upgrade to wireless accessories and you need both devices.PLEASE VOTE HELPFUL IF YOU LIKED MY REVIEW"
2,Buy this wireless keyboard ONLY if you are just going to use it for basic use.NEVER for any sort of gaming. Keyboard and Mouse both lags on high CPU usage or game frame rates.there is no refund only useless replacement for this.I went back to my wired keyboard and mouse within one day. This is now packed back into the box...I will probably sell it for a loss on olx...
1,"After 4 months of infrequent use, the spring under some of the keys broke down. The product boasts of warranty of three years but it wont last even 6 months. The service centre at Gurgaon doesn't have the replacement ready. It takes nearly 10-15 days to get a new replacement. Till that time, sit tight and enjoy becuase you bought logitech product. Please avoid !!"
4,"I'm using this for 3 days only so its a quick review.Keyboard :Overall size is adequate for usage. Key sizes are a bit shorter than a regular wired keyboard of HP or Dell is what I felt bcos of which keys are going to next key than intended. Keys are noisy while typing, sounds like a less than 500 Rs unbranded keyboard which is not good for the brand.No comments on lag or range while typingMouse : I was using MK331 Silent mouse earlier, compared to that Smaller in size, and the feel is not good also click sounds are noisy. But this is not a silent mouse so accepted. I saw a bit of lag not sure whether this is bcos of something else.Overall this is budget pack.if you can extend a bit more go for MK345 combo, it claims quiet keyboard and the mouse looks like MK331 silent mouse but nowhere its is mentioned as M331 in the site."
3,"Review after 5 months of usageThe Good:The keyboard is good, strongly built, easily goes for years.It has all the keys you need, keys for volume control are really handy for me same with home, end button which are missing in my laptop.Works with Mac - Im able to use windows button as command key for (apple) mac, the Alt key as option key.It has caps lock indicator (light) which is helpful while typing the passwords.Not so good:However the keys bit hard especially when you are trying to type fast, you need to make sure that the keys are fully pressed down, otherwise some of the key may not be registered. The hard keys issue specifically happens when your finger touches the edge of the key - the key get kind of stuck between the adjacent keys. Its difficult to ensure that the fingers touch exactly in the middle of the key, its really annoying. This is happening more with windows key which Im using as command keyIf you want to really soft keyboard this may not be the option."
1,"Sometimes mouse and keyboard does not work, not expected from a company like Logitech"
5,"Even though this is not meant for Gaming, I have ended up using it. I thought we use a wireless PS4 controller so why not this. I also have a ReadGear Gaming Keyboard + Mouse combo and its started giving me issue in a year of gaming. I had to replace my ReadGear set with LG G102 Gamin Mouse and HP Gaming Keyboard K500F.This in comparison is working really well. All the Keys work fine, there are no misfires.. Its excellent. O have noticed some signal issues, for this I just make sure that the radio is connected on either side of the laptop (Not on one of the back USB Connectors)."
5,"Being a combo pack, don't expect a high quality product especially mouse.Keyboard build looks sturdy and when we type, we get some typing sound which is satisfying (this is subjective).Caps lock indicator works fine. On/off button works fine.Once I received product, I checked online if my keys are working fyn or not :D and everything is fine.Coming to Mouse, it appears with decent build quality(saying this because I have used lenovo 300(this is of solid build) earlier, on comparing logitech's mouse with Lenovo's, I observed it.).Battery, on/off button works fine. Mouse's precision is accurate and there's no lag.(even though if there's any lag, we can tweak the mouse settings).It was mentioned that battery life for keyboard is 36months and of mouse is 18months.When u turn it off while u r not using, expected battery life can be attained.Main reason I purchased this one is, I used Logitech K120 earlier, referring to its build quality, I got this one. And I needed 3 yrs warranty and good battery life with on/off buttons on both.Point to be noted : this is not a compact product. This one is a standard keyboard with all keys. So don't expect to carry it everywhere. If u need a compact one, u can go with portronics."
4,"I was actually pleasantly surprised how sturdy, robust and convenient this keyboard and mouse combo turned out to be.Pros:1. The keys are remarkably silent compared to many other keyboards2. The keys size and shape is sturdy and even the print is good which makes it super easy to operate3. Mouse is handy, small enough, big enough which makes it very friendly and reduces the chances of getting RSI4. Both keyboard and mouse have on/off toggle switches which is saving battery a lot and they last longer5. Indicator for CAPS lock comes handyCONS1. There are no indicators for Num Lock and Scroll Lock2. There is no indicator for battery levelOverallGreat value for money, if above indicators are added and keys are made slightly more silent, it will earn 5 stars on any day"
1,"After a firtnightly usage, with a sluggish and lagging Logitech MK270R keyboard and Mouse combo, I have thrown the KB and mouse into the dustbin. Such a badly designed product. It just literally slows down a 8 GB PC with ample storage space. Wireless connectivity to internet is getting slowed down. If I disconnect the KB and mouse from the computer, the net works normal and the mouse and keyboard  typing actions is taking ages to show up on the screen. I updated all the drivers including Logitech SPOT app. But to my dismay it has tested my patience prompting me to use the old PS/2 KB  and Moouse which are wired and work without any issues. Please don't buy this product."
5,"Great product from Logitech. Always recommend.High-quality product and is very durable, great precision.The mouse is Invisible Optic.I do both coding and gaming using this and surprisingly has a long battery life.Haven't changed the battery since purchase (before 4 months).Good for daily usage.Amazon delivery was great and arrived before the expected date."
1,"The product I got seems to be defective. The keys a wobbly, once you are typing, there is a lag.The product when I received was in a damaged package, when asked to the delivery, told he cannotdo anything about it. While typing the keys are getting missed.Not a product that I was expecting to be so cheap."
1,The keyboard and mouse stop and start functioning on a random basis.When actively typing the keyboard just freezes up or the unifying receiver stop responding and the keystrokes are completely lost.  This is a major issue when typing passwords. The same happens with the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer is jumpy or completely unresponsive and one ends up clicking unwanted things which becomes a waste of time. Contacting the logitech service center is also a complete waste of time. Think 2ice before buying it even though there might be offers on it.
3,"Keyboard:I’ve owned and used many, many keyboards—and I can confidently say the keys are harder to press than average; they have an uncomfortably soft feel. If a “good” keyboard is like tapping a steel spoon on a hard surface, this one is like pressing three fingers into a medium-hard pillow. Sound-wise, this might be good for some people though; the keys are relatively silent.There’s an extra, unnecessary line of multimedia keys at the top—as a result of which the Function keys are half the regular size. Plus, beware the dangerous “sleep” or “shut down” button: It put my computer into a weird hibernate mode. After waking from hibernate, two connected USB devices were getting disconnected and reconnected by themselves; I have *no idea* how that button managed this—it’s never happened on my laptop before! ...And there are a couple of keys that do nothing; I have no idea why Logitech thought it a good idea to bring back the multimedia keys that pretty much went out 10 years ago.There’s a keyboard on-off button at the top right. The battery lasts for more than a year; why would anyone want to turn the keyboard off?! AND as a result, there’s no space for the Num Lock indicator—only the Caps Lock indicator.Mouse:It’s too small for the average adult male hand—and probably the ideal size for the average adult female hand. The tracking is spot on—on various surfaces and surface colours/darkness—and the buttons are decent (neither too hard to press nor too sensitive to the touch). No idea about gaming.Range:As you’d expect from Logitech. You can use the keyboard and mouse from anywhere in the room, pretty much.Overall, this is mid-low quality, BUT good value for money. To summarise: Spend just maybe 1,000 more and get something better. Buy this one if you’re really on a tight budget—AND you have woman-sized hands."
1,"Within a month of use, the keys become loose and sometimes presses down on its own. With limited Service Centres (Ensure Services) and ""Great Than Thou"" attitude of Service Centre staff and Amazon ""apologetically refusing"" to do any help, I have decided to make it run as long as it dones and then buy a new one. Seems like few others buyers are facing the same issue. Anyway travelling to a service centre will cost as much as buying a new one."
1,"The mouse doesn't work and gets stuck.Even the scroll option doesn't work always.ADDING TO MY EARLIER REVIEW.......WORST PIECE OF GARBAGE EVER BOUGHT. i USED DELL COMBO BEFORE THIS, ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES FOR 6 YEARS STILL WORKS, JUST HAVE TO PRESS FEW KEYS HARDER ON THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE IS FLAWLESS. I CALLED AMAZON REP AND HE JUST PASSED THE BUCKET, AND TOLD ME GET IN TOUCH WITH SUPPLIER.  IF I HAD THIS MUCH FREE TIME WHY WOULD I BUY THE CRAP ONLINE. ITS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT, THE MOUSE WAS MALFUNCTIONING SINCE DAY ONE....THE CURSOR WOULD GET STUCK ANYTIME, SCROLLING MECHANISM IS A WASTE, DON'T WORK, KEYBOARD HAS ALSO STARTED ACTING UP....LOGITECH SUCKS...I DON'T KNOW WHY I WENT FOR THIS BRAND, NOT NOW NEVER WILL IT COME CLOSE TO DELL....CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THOSE SPEAKERS THEY MAKE AS WELL....JUST GARBAGE BASS NO MIDS, HIGHS,....WONT BUY ANY LOGITECH STUFF EVER......."
3,"This keyboard is good for it's price, Nothing extraordinary, serves it purpose.Pros:1. 3 years warranty, one of the few keyboards with that kind of warranty.2. Has a Caps Lock Indicator (Higher range keyboards don't have a caps lock indicator)3. Keyboard Layout itself is good, Keys are appropriately placed.4. Media control keys5. Long Battery Life6. Single receiver for keyboard and mouseCons:1. The keyboard deck has quite a bit of flex to it, a bit more than my liking.2. The mouse is not comfortable to hold. I ended up keeping it aside and using my M331 separately which defeats the purpose of a combo3. No Numlock indicator, I guess this would have been done to save power from keeping the LED lit all the time.4. Keys are a little mushy, I would want a bit more clicky feel compared to other basic membrane keyboards.5. Non Unifying, Would have loved it to be unifying so I could use it with my M331 in a single receiver.I have a M331 mouse, which comes with a nano receiver (non unifying) and a M235 which comes with a unifying receiver, and this combo which again comes with a nano receiver, I tries all possible combinations but I could not get this keyboard and my M331 paired to a single receiver (I really don't like the feel of the M185 mouse that comes with this keyboard)."
3,"After I received a used product once, I requested for a replacement and seller shipped a sealed piece this time.Product Review:Pros: No lag in keyboard or mouse. Both will last long. Both are very light weight. Ease of going wireless is unbeatable. I was not using desktops since almost 10 years now. A full size keyboard with that typing noise is nostalgic atleast for me. Hope it doesn't cause disturbance to others on the call while I speak and type. On and off buttons on both keyboard and mouse. Caps lock light.Cons: for this price point the buttons have to be noiseless. Printing of letters on the keyboard buttons can be of better quality, they look bloated without smooth edges. Also the bumps on F and G are just thin lines, you can barely feel them. People who knew typing will understand this problem. Logitech could have given 2 latch height adjustment, there is only one which is just ok.Consider this as an entry level wireless keyboard and mouse combo. Since this is from Logitech, I hope it lasts long."
1,I have has very bad experience with the warranty section of Logitech. I talked to the number given. First you to have to keep on trying. Secondly it when you reach them and explain to them the problem faced by you then they refer you to another number which they call it as Service Centre. If that is what they wanted to do then  why not give the Service Centre number then the other number. They just do not want to avoid servicing under warranty. I have been regularly been their customer for last more than 10 years. I am facing teh same prob lem of right c lic k being not working after ab t 8 to 9 months. This I faced it earlier but did not take it up. I am very diappointed.
5,"Excellent product, very useful and innovative. I loved it very much. Great battery life, good for gaming and typing. RGB lighting makes it quite exciting. It's like a remote of your PC, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile ir android tv/set top box, definitely can go for it. It's a complete replacement for keyboard plus mouse, great innovation. Salute for innovator."
5,The product is really amazing .First received a non active but later seller replaced and made sure that i receive a active product . i am really enjoying the wireless keyboard plus mouse pad in-build. Great quality 👍🏻. Working on my smart tv as well.

4,"I am using the item for my desktop PC and operating it from the other corner of the room which is quite a fair distance. The mouse movement is smooth and convenient. All the keys including the additional ones are ok. But the most attractive thing is the backlight which keeps on auto-changing while working. Overall, it's a great value for money. And there is a warranty card also which promises 1 year coverage.However, the user manual is inadequate. It does not mention how the backlight can be turned on and how to wake up the item from sleep mode. Also for the first time user, it may be difficult to find the usb remote which is hidden at the back inside the battery cover.Anyway, if you are looking for a handy and attractive wireless combo at an affordable budget, don't think too much. Go for this item.Also thanks to Amazon for their prompt delivery."
4,Growing up I couldn't even imagine about things like this but now cannot imagine my life without it. Technologically we have progressed so far in the last 25 years....... I use this mainly for my Smart TV.It is easy to control some apps with this mainly YouTube. Thank you.
4,"I have been using this for 7months, this is very usefull(not for gaming)Pros: 1.super battery back up for me 5 to 7 days(1000mah battery),  2.mouse touch response is perfect,  3.it have every button u need,  4.size is perfect easy and comfortable to use,  5.after few sec if u niot using this will turn off autometically, this save a lot of battery,  6.charging 1.5hr to 2hr and use 5 to 7 days  7.RGB lights are awesome,Cons:  1.build quality average,  2.only space button have to press hardly,  3.not for gamers  Definitely recommend if u are not gamer."

5,"This product has saved my time and effort in typing stuff on my normal smart tv remote. Love the price, would definitely buy more and recommending the product to everyone i know owning a smart tv. Rechargeable so don’t even worry about the batteries being additional purchased. Super handy and portable. It is actually smaller than my actual remote!"
1,Stopped working just after a few and seller is no where to be found it didn't come with battery aswell and i had to get my battery from an old keyboard i had worst experience from this company Viboton i hope after reading this review you guys will contact me
1,Pros:Fn+F2 for RGB background color then continue with Fn+left or right cursor for seven colors including RGB.Cons:Costly.Not good for gaming.Background light for 3 second.
4,Product is nice. package quality is also good. Only one problem in this keyboard is you can't connect this with Bluetooth or wifi. Its only work with usb dongle.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
5,"Thanks Amazon and main help from customers reviews.I have a old Onida Smart TV, 32 inches this is working comfortable with TV.  I have just started using, so far so good."
5,"Awesome, a must have gadget, i use it for my pc which is connected to tv in my room.Backlight is awesome & u can change them like funky, chek youtube how to change colors & has hidden color settings."
5,"Pros:The product is compact and very easy to hold... Quicker responsive keys and track pad. The keyboard quality and the keys are good. Battery backup is excellent.Cons: The backlit is good but powerful in dark, I felt eye strainOverall the product is highly recommended for Android TV Box, Mobile, etc..."

5,I got the product today and has been doing good. The USB Receiver I got is a tiny bit off the standard USB port size - it goes in so tightly.Everything else has been good. Will update if I find more or gets in trouble
4,The Colourful backlit is wonderful. However the Gamepad control keys are on Top instead of below. So it is bit difficult to hold and operate!
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"I bought it for my laptop, that I can connect it with my TV to watch OTTs. It is very useful and has backlight and many shortcuts. It is worth it. If you turns it off un unused time charge stands upto a month.Gaming it is hard and not recommended.It has micro usb charging port."
3,Use of the keyboard is pretty limited on television. It work while navigating and typing in an app but difficult to shift from one app to another
3,"Product is good,Packing is good also.Small keys drawback.For Smart TV volume is on F9 & F10.Silent mode on F8 & home on F5.No direct function control of volume,pause etc through this Set for Smart TV.If you want to buy for PC,then buy Logitech wireless Keypad and Mouse"
5,I used with android TV and laptop all features are perfect working. Bluetooth connection is fast and maintained well. Must buy.

4,"Overall the keyboard is good and that with RGB .One think I want to make clear This keyboard is not made for pc gaming if you want to play emulated games (Cemu,yuzu,2ds,pS3)then it is good"

2,"I've been using this keyboard and mouse for 5 weeks now and got to say the mouse response is really bad. If you're purchasing this keyboard and mouse for an office computer then think again, the mouse response will make you mad for sure. The keyboard works perfectly and some missing. The mouse pointer misses the target 90% of the time. Trust me :) I don't usually write a review about the product that I've purchased but this one left me no choice but to mention the experience  I had. I don't think its happening for all the mouse but you can try your luck :). I just wanted to wish you a GOOD LUCK on this purchase :D"
1,"Been using this since Aug 2020, and here is what I have to say:I needed a compact keyboard and mouse for my workspace since I use two screens, and I did ton of research on something that is reliable and I can pack it in my bag.The keyboard layout is compact but you will get used to typing on it. so no complains about the keyboard.The Problem is the MOUSE. It is an absolute piece of GARBAGE. Does not matter if the batteries are new or old, how close you are to the transmitter. It just does not work.Problems with the mouse:It lags a ton, and I am talking a LOT! It hiccups and keeps reconnecting. why is this a huge problem? Imaging you selected some items and you are drag-and-dropping, in the middle of your tasks it just dies and your whole selection is ruined.Today another problem surfaced and I had to write a review to prevent others from buying this:Scroll wheel does not work on light press, I have to press it harder than before and with the hiccups is suddenly works 4 times at once.This might matter to you depending on the size of your hands. I have large hands and the mouse is not comfortable at all, it is way too small for meIn Conclusion: Do not waste your money on this piece of trash"
4,I had never found complaint with Logitech product. I was using this brand from very long time. Planning to buy next model than this....
1,"Waited for almost a week and then i get tk know It doesnt work , this product comes with batteries in it but they were also missing when plugged reciever logitech's software says no reciever deteced"
3,"Initially, I had several problems because the response lagged, especially when doing CPU intensive work. That seems to have resolved somewhat over time, and I have no idea how or why. I have to clarify that the reason I bought this was to have a small footprint keyboard, so that I could also accommodate a drawing tablet on the right side. For that purpose, it works fine. One feature I really miss is the ability to use a function key or moderator key to convert some keys to a numeric keypad. As I require unicode characters, this is a problem. I understand that some mini keyboards allow converting some keys to number keypad. The mouse is a bit small for my likes, but then I don't use it at all."
4,Its a good product...worth buying..
5,"I have been using this pair for a month now. INSIDE BOX- so the box comes with one mouse, one keyboard, four remote batteries and one USB port(for connectivity). After one month of use I haven't change the batteries they are still going so battery backup is good all you need two batteries for each. (There's a small slot in the mouse itself to store the USB). TO CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM ALL YOU NEED IS TO INSERT THE USB AND SWITCH ON THE MOUSE. Although the keyboard connects directly with the USB.GAMING- You can do moderate gaming with this but heavy is not meant for this. Plus it's compact so you'll find difficult to find the keys while intense gaming.TYPING- This is a compact size keyboard without num pad. It's easy to carry plus takes lass space in the bag. The keys are soft to type plus they are firm.BODY- The body is made up of good plastic material. It's feels sturdy while holding in hands. It has a rubber grip in the bottom for better grip on the surface you are putting it(basically your work table).Well taking about value for money I'll say getting this quality + connectivity+ wireless system. It'll be best offer to buy a compact size mouse keyboard set under ₹1500."
4,"I have bought this only for the keyboard this is the best keyboard experience till now they keys are nice smooth clicky and responsive let's understand this combo properly hereKeyboard1. small compact perfect for those who are working from home fits on the table don't take up too much space and wireless perfect for productivity2. Typing experience is somewhere between normal and mechanical keyboard. In low profile and medium profile keys, the keypress is very smooth feels very nice and responsive. The compact size ensures you're not moving much while typing.3. Definitely not for gaming I mean no wireless keyboard and mouse combo are not for gaming.Cons about mousethis is the part you have to make some adjustmentthe mouse freeze sometimes and I had to use another mouse for some time because this mouse is kinda broken but only in few casesmy mouse did not work properly at the start then it just got better from the day or two I was using another Logitech mouse1499 only for keyboard and I'm telling you won't regret it if somehow you make peace with mouse"
3,"GREAT PRICE. Typing is very comfortable. The size is very convenient for small desks. The battery lasts for a VERY LONG TIME, haven't replaced the cells in 2 years. However, sometimes suddenly stops working or keys type some other character. But the problem only occurred once and went away in 2 days."
5,Overall satisfied except the mouse part which every one has highlighted. It sometimes behaves weird. Been using since around a month. I am happy so far. Given I already had one Logitech K480 still I have opted for this.The reason being for my office work I use Linux mostly and for personal things windows. Now Logitech K480 is very good except every time you swap between operating system you got to reconnect your device with necessary token which was little awkward (Might be for security reason). With Logitech MK240 given the connectivity is through USB hence its very seamless and no hassle when you swap between OS.One thing I learnt that the USB receiver should be connected directly to computer USB port rather than any extender USB port hub. This I learned in few days even the instruction manual says it; else you would wonder why keyboard inputs and mouse behaviour are lagging. But once you connect your USB receiver directly to computer USB port it works seamlessly. Just wanted to highlight even the mouse feels far better and reliant. Hope it is useful to all.
5,"Just the way I wanted. Small, smart and a beauty. Just the write sized for a medium sized palm and for someone who is more acquainted to work on a laptop keyboard. At my home, I have my laptop hooked up to a monitor for projecting my laptop screen. And this keyboard brings in just the right comfort and handling for long office hours."
5,"I got this as a WFH replacement for my Mac Pro keyboard since the butterfly switches felt like they were dying. The key placement is identical to the Mac's and even if you're a Windows user, you'd be right at home. The keys however, are a little too close to each other and sometimes that causes problems in touch typing and also, this KBM is expensive during this time ( I got it for 1.7k, even though I see people getting it for around 1k). The mouse is utilitarian.The size is very, very compact (again, like the 13 inch mac pro, so I felt right at home). So you shouldn't have any problems in portability."
2,Way to bulky for a mini keyboard... cheap looking ... utterly nonsense sense of color.Regretting the purchase
4,"I've used Ant Esports MK1000 for about 1 year or so after that some keys start ghosting & I think this ghosting issue is like a curse to almost every budget / midrange mechanical keyboards, that's why I switched to this Logitech MK240 NANO.Pros:- good battery life- typing experience is fairly good as well- media keys- very compact, even more compact than any regular TLK keyboard- comes with a mouse which is fairly good as well- wireless receiver can be inserted into mouse itself so while travelling with this keyboard & mouse there are less chances of losing that receiverNote: if coming from mechanical keyboard or some other keyboard you might have wrist pain for some days using this keyboard which will go away after some time"
1,"I bought this keyboard and mouse combo for around 1500 rs. My whole intention to buy this combo was because it was compact and blended well with my table. At first,by looking by at a few review's I was happy to get this amazing combo from Logitech at a fair price. The product worked fine for a day or two. After that the mouse started having very bad response time. At first I thought it was because I recieved a faulty product and decided to give it up for exchange. After a week or so, I got my exchanged product. Again like the old combo, the mouse started having bad response time but this time it was even worse. Then I decided to return this product in exchange for the amount I paid. Terrible combo from Logitech, a company who's products I've been using from a long time.Finally I ended up buying zebronics gaming keyboard and mouse combo which was worth its price. Again if you are planning on buying this I recommend u to do a fair research. Few better alternatives are dells and zebronics keyboard and mouse combo.. hope this review comes handy."
5,"I am a space conscious person. I want everything neat and also fitting the space.I found this budget friendly keyboard and mouse, thought give it a try.Bit worried about negative reviews. But after I got it, I tried and found it really worthy.Build quality is superb. The key play is also adequate. Not too noisy and at the same time doesn't feel dead.Mouse is also very handy. The only thing I may not like is the jazzy color. But I might put a sticker of some sort to hide the graffiti on the keyboard. Overall I am happy with the purchase.Seller shipped it in a day. Kudos to him/her."
5,"Perfect size for lapton 15"". Ideal for travel n carrying along. It's new..so presently no issues..if I will face any ..then I shall post.I am not into gaming or heavy typing so cannot comnent.ProsKeys have adequate space.CompactSturdyResponse is perfect4 Cells free along with product.Mouse response is super fine.ConsNo num padCaps lock indicator not providedOverall a perfect keyboard ."
5,Initially I got an open box with different mouse and wireless usb device also was missing.I called the customer care and explained the issue and they helped me to replace the item ..I got the replacement today and I am very happy with the support provided by amazon and I like this compact mouse and keyboard combo ..Thank you amazon..
5,"I got it yesterday... Using for two days... Don't know  how many days the battery will last...But most importantly the keys are quick responsive and best thing about this is the compact design... One more advantage is it do not have any light so my common sense says it will save battery...Lookwise its smart, compact and portable...And the colour combination is pretty nice...The mouse is good, quick responsive... And the mouse has an On-Off switch which is the best part of it...I think it would be the best if the keyboard also had a On-Off switch, that would save the battery a lot... Because no matter how we use the keyboard and mouse, no one uses them whole day...I was very much confused before buying the set... Because I had bought many (₹400-₹700) budget Bluetooth combos earlier... Each and every one of it were useless after 2-3 months of use... So I researched quite a lot before buying this and decided to spend more to get a good product... As Logitech is doing good in this field... I decided to use this one...It has 3 years warranty so at least it should work smoothly for 2 years fingers crossed🙂... I will again review this after 6 months... Let's see how it works..."
1,"-- - update after 3 months: mouse started freezing out often. Have to restart it to unfreeze it .. but its happening only when am using .. not in idle.. hence am guessing that its a design level defect of the mouse in this combo; meaning in this money u will only get keyboard. mouse is not durable.Old review on receipt: Nice combo in budget .. and best thing is compactness, as i needed it the most for ergonomics ...."
1,"I am reviewing this product after 2 years of use. As their warranty is for 3 years my keyboards some keys are not responding. After intimating to the service centre they say that please send the product to US through courier so they will provide service but when I send this product to thevservice centre, the courier has returned me the shipment as there is no such address in our state Odisha. So please don't rely on Logistic services just by and when it shoes fault just throw it away."
3,"I ordered this logitech keyboard and mouse combo as many of my friends praised Logitech for high quality computer accessories . But , as soon as I started using this product , I was shocked . Ok , hear me out -CONS:1. Cheap , I mean really cheap quality plastic is used for making this product . This thing may be ok for school kids but not for serious usage .2. Keys are not tactile and feedback is not good . I think you will get better quality wireless keyboard at local computer shops at half of it's price .3. Talking about Mouse, buttons are not clicky , feels really cheap ( You can take a look at Mi wireless mouse at 500/- which is far better in terms of quality)Note : I won't comment about battery life as I have not used it extensively yet.PROS:Umm, well NOTHING!!"
2,"I have purchased Keyboard and Mouse from amazon on Date 20.05.2020.Unfortunately It is started malfunctioning [if i am pressing key its giving different output]I have tried contacting Amazon but since 10 days are already passed and there return policy got closed .I see there is 3 years warranty for these products so i would like to replace them OR REFUND for them .let us know procedure for sameKEYBOARD S/N : 1952SY01SBF8 ,  MOUSE  S/N :  1952SY01R9S8i am not happy"
4,"The keyboard is the better pick here. The key design and strokes are pretty nice. For the layout, I would prefer the Home, End, Pg Up and Pg Down keys separately on the right most end.I choose the mini keyboard to fit both keyboard and mouse on my keyboard draw.I faced an issue with the mouse many times, which is the cursor gets jumped and sometimes the cursor gets stuck. Might be a problem with the Bluetooth connection.The overall package is very good with a reasonable price."
5,"previously some people  mentioned some complaints, i still took a risk and bought it, i was surprised to find keyboard and mouse worked well, keyboard is small and compact, mouse is responsive, and sensitive both have good range and sensitivity, this unit compares better than my previous logitech purchases ofcourse its logitech so yes its a good buy,"
5,"A very good bulild Quality , smooth clicking buttons , a good range for connectivity .Best thing about it is , its a small key board with big buttons , and all the keys including short cut keys e.g page up ,page down ,home, end also funtion keys like calculator ,search ,volum up/down , music play pause ,volume mute and all.Though I am using it for work from home for programing and development , its very comfortable and usefull for that .Thank you amazon for doing one day delivery in this Covid situation ."
2,"I'M TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH THE MOUSE AS IT WORKS TOO SLOW AND AT TIME DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. I DESPERATELY NEED A REPLACEMENT, HOWEVER WHEN I NOTICED THE RETURN OR REPLACEMENT SECTION IT WAS VERY SHORT AND THE DAY HAS ELAPSED. ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH ME IS TO THROUGH THE MOUSE AWAY AND BUY A WIRED MOUSE WHICH TOTALLY DISRUPTS THE NEED FOR AN BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER."
1,"I had high expectations from the product but to my dismay I had a bad experience with the keyboard. The keys in the keyboard are very stiff and there is malfunction of the space bar button. When i press the space bar it doesn't comes back up, due to which while typing I get a very big gap in my sentences. The mouse that came with it has nice grip and the screen pointer sensitivity is good but the scroller is very slow and feels too mechanical. Overall not a good product. Won't recommend it."
4,"Now remember that this is not a high end mechanical gaming keyboard and mouse combo. If ur goal is to have a wireless desk setup like me go for it just get a different mouse not the best mouse for gaming, because itlacks dpi settings. Do connect the dongle in a usb2. 0 port of u have laging or stuttering issue will fix it immediately. Conclusion definitely worth the purchase battery life is super long quality is good for its price, compact build, and at a good price point. For mouse I would recommend logitech g304 in budget wireless mouse."
5,"Simple, small, light, comfortable, effective.The only reason I hesititated with this product was because of the flashy paint scheme. But after getting the black with the yellow trim, it actually looks ok - isn't too flashy on the desk.I like the compact size - fits will on the desk with enough space for the mouse or other items. I'm not very picky about the key feel - its fine - moderate travel, and moderate stiffness - nothing surprising. I can type fast and accurately on it.The mouse does jump a bit, but I realised its because of dust on the rubber feet elevates it about the surface and surface tracking is affected. If you clean the dust regularly or use it on a softer material, like a cloth covered mouse pad, it works fine.Good product. Reliable. Works well. Good battery life. Not as flashy as it looks in the pic (which I like)."
5,Latest update:I purchased this product Logitech Nano K240 on 26th Jul 2021 and worked fine till 23rd Aug 2021.  Few keys stopped working and I raised a ticket with Logitech.  Warranty claim process was very simple and I got the replacement keyboard and mouse on 30th Aug 2021.  Good work by Logitech!!
5,Works well with laptops or desktops. There is absolutely no lag. May not be best for gaming as not all direct buttons are available and some features like page up and page down may have to be accessed by pressing combination keys. My recommendation for gamers is to check the layout and then buy.
4,only brought this products combo for keyboard. i was looking for a keyboard that is small so that i can accomudate keyboard+gaming mouse in slide under my old pc desk.>mouse:not the best mouse. it skipped couple pixels here and there and doesnt regiester some clicks... but it mi8 be due to me being using only 1000HZ refersh rate mouse ofr last few years. mouse accelartion is worst!(u can turn it off in software). mouse uses more battery than keyboard.##worst mouse u will ever find##>keyboard:it is the main reason i brought this combo.small form keyboard. wanted something i can use along with my gaming mouse in confined area(50cmx30cm) and still game on it.used for heavy gaming and did not feel any input lag (mouse is switched off)>misc. pros:if u are using more than 1 logitech accessories which are wireless than u can connect upto 6 devices to 1 usb recevier whic is usefull to save ports on pc and free up ports for other accessoriesif u open official support page it says there is no software avalible ... but there are 3 softwares for this keyboard. found if u search for product code: Y-R00017 (Same product with blue and black)TLDR: if you'r looking for a small form factor keyboard only. then this combo is best... just throw out the mouse if u want keyboard+mouse look elsewhere... but still worth it if u are very new to computers and not so much into response times and missed click and pixel registers on mouse.
5,Very good product to protect macbook keyboar from dust and dirt. Perfectly fits on keyboard...Simply amazing..

5,Outstanding and perfectly fits my MacBook and lightweight
2,You can’t see keyboard light through this protector. Poor quality. Don’t buy guys. You cannot even closer MacBooks lid properly if you use this keyboard protector.
5,this product is simply amazing!! The fit is excellent. The colors are extremely pretty and the price is a cherry on the top! Highly recommend this to everyone.
5,Nice product... perfact fit for macbook pro M1

3,"Since it’s not transparent, in the dark it’s not easy to work on, light from the keyboard is not visible"
5,love this product
5,"At this price It is a value for money product no issue in typing, backlit, fitting"
4,"A good value for money product , fits perfectly!!"
4,It's overpriced should be of 200 to 300 nothing special of 400
2,Not perfect in key all
5,Excellent price and excellent product
5,Good value for money product
1,The typing experience with this keyboard cover is horrible. The fitting of the cover was perfect but the clear case is not value for money
5,"It fits perfectly and really slim , worth the buy"

2,"I used this keyboard for a while and I felt that the keys are very hard and small too..... After sometime my fingers started paining so I stopped and after that when I used it with the RGBs turned off, that was a very bad experience. Nothing was visible, the print is not at all visible and the wire quality is also not up to the mark...... Overall this keyboard is not good for Typers and gamers as well because your fingers may start to feel pain after sometime. If you're a person who has to type a lot then I recommend you to buy the Logitech K120.Try to avoid this keyboard!"
5,"Great build quality. Key strokes are really satisfying, but a little loud. You should always use it with the backlight on, because the key markings are transparent. One drawback can be that the cable is not that strong. But for the price, it's decent. Go for it."
5,The keyboard comes with excellent backlit and premium quality packaging. Ergonomic design reduces muscle strain and thus provides hassle free gaming experience. The keyboard  have an windows keylock feature. The mix LED modes floating keycaps gives the keyboard a versatile look. The keyboard also consists of double injected keycaps which ensures crystal clear backlighting. Thus the keyboard is an all in one package for gamers at such an affordable price.
4,Good deal on the budget
5,Nice design and build quality. It feels solid and nice keys as well. Well seperated keys and background colouring is the cherry on top at this price. I looked and tried various keyboards and i am well sure of that this is the best u could get at this price.

4,As I was the first one to purchase this and also the first one to write the review I would like to say that the product is very awesome after visiting so much of website and many more to find a decent keyboard protector for my laptop I end up finding this and it was one of the best purchase of Amazon ordering history thanku Amazon for this great product
4,"It fits perfect to my rog strix g. but It will not fit new 2021 g15 because G15 have some little bit different design of arrow keys and some positioning difference. But fits older variant perfectly it's ""Same as shown in the picture "" So check your laptop keyboard and match it. But I think it is quite expensive in 399rs ."
4,"The cover of the laptop is very good but its price is very high, it would have been better if it was 200 rupees ❤️"
3,"Don't deserved 399 price tag,  price should be 150 or max to max 200rs"
5,Outstanding product. would recommend anyday

5,Delivery man is niceGreat product
3,₹400 is too much for this !!
3,Good Protection to the key board. Fits fine on My Acer Nitro 5Not as Transparent as required.!Now I Cant see my keys without Backlight.Has some concentrated portions over the surface
2,"It's material quality is moderate, but not suitable as, once it get dust it won't fit on keyboard but easy to clean and should be cleaned frequently."
1,It is realy worst...please donot buy this...waste of money...no stickyness at all...no use of putting it on keyboard..and properly transperant too cant see clearly...instead get these things from local shops...doesnt deserve any star
4,"It's a Good product, it's slightly longer than my 15.6inch lap key board(pic attached), but it is doing its duty very well so no prob with it."
1,"When I opened the package, I was shocked.  The product was folded!!  When I put it on my keyboard, the fold mark remains distinctly on the right side just above the numeric keys' area (see pic).  The seller, in trying to save a couple of inches of packing paper, has completely messed up the product.  Also, the product is just a thin translucent silicone rubber sheet, worth not more than Rs. 5.  Adhesion is average.  It is not transparent.  It is milky white in colour.  If you look at the keyboard directly from above, most keys are visible, but from a normal viewing angle of a laptop, we will have difficulties in locating the keys.  After a few days of usage, I discarded the thing.  Don't waste your money on it.  Better go to a local computer shop, look at the available options and then decide.  It is not correct to shop such products on eCommerce portals because of too many unknowns at the time of ordering."
3,"Material is good.Gets dirty very frequently like almost everyday.If no backlight keyboard available, you will face a lot of visibility issue.I have to DIY it, refer the photo"
5,"Hi, I ordered this product from Amazon 6 years back, see the attached screenshot for the order date. I re-ordered this one today. Its very good product. It lasted for me around 5 years and without any issues, I washed it number of times and re-used it. No issues observed for me. It became loose after 5 years of use and got torn at some places so I had to buy new one. I have used very roughly and still lasted long. Now I re-ordered same one, I have extra keyboard and I don't use my laptop keyboard that much, so I have to use this product to keep my laptop keyboard safe & durable. I hope I can make it through more than last time. Thank you for the product. Only sad thing is inside the product its says made in China, last time also it was made in China, Please manufacture in India for India."
1,I have received keyboard protector which is tampered from one side and the other side looks nice.Not sure about the size. It sticks easily to keyboard giving a perfect protection but one side looks really bad.Thanks
2,If you are a gamer and using your laptop for that purpose you should buy two or there of these because it will rip off after few weeks or months and you would need more.TIP: Buy two of these cover your keyboard with both the protector or you can either fold 1 and place over W A S D keys which we gamers often use that part is very crucial and only that part will rip off so my suggestion to make a double of that protection fold it and place it inside another protector.  Also the adhesive is useless so use your cello tape to fix it. Hope it helps
3,"Was looking for a temporary fix as the Silicon key guard for my Dell latitude isn't available in Indian thus ecporting the same, needed a temporary fix thusProsThe price pointFor strictly temporary usageConsAvailable in 1 size.Doesn't stick to your machine at llProtection ..... just dust and accidental spill...if the cover is lying on your key pad"
3,"My laptop does not have a backlit keyboard, in my room, usually, the main light is turned off. However, with this silicon protector, I cannot see the keys at all. Would be great if it was more transparent. So I purchased a USB led light to do the job. Also, it does not stick that great, I use it only when I am not typing, or when I'm away."
1,"Very bad quality product. It's got white patches, making it difficult to read the letters. It's neither fitting the keyboard enough, nor is it sticking to the laptop.Following the instructions is a waste, as there is no sheet that can be removed from the back of the skin."
4,"For the price, this product is very good. However as obvious from the price, this quality is low. It is a plain surface with low quality plastic. But it does the job and prevents dust from accumulating on the laptop keypad."
2,"Product is correct quality for the price. Expectations should be as low as the price.My experience with it, I'll shareProduct is not packed/finished correctly from the manufacturer end.The bend you see in the image that i have attached, is not unfolding, it is stuck like that as if its been heated and pressed hard.While typing on it, it will keep sliding around with your finger by few millimetres or centimetres here and there so you have to adjust it often.It gets lifted too when typing as your finger and this material will have more friction between both than the material and the keyboard"
5,This is a great product. You can go with it. But if you are thinking to put this on and then type on the keyboard that will make it difficult. I use a usb keyboard hence I do not have have any issues. This product stops dirt and dust entering your keyboard and also protect it from any spill water.

1,"Delivery was really fast (ordered in evening and product got delivered in morning) but it was returned product from someone, since the cost was 69 only with free delivery hence didn't placed replacement order and keeping it, it is used but surely work for 2 to 3 months after cleaning it properly, it is recommended to purchase such cheaper products locally."
3,"It arrived in time and well packed. A fold on the silicone done during packing buy the manufacturer, remains even after a month. It does not stick well. Opacity is fine to allow keys to be visible. It covers entire keyboard. Thickness is ok. Minimum order quality of 2 is another factor which can be made to 1."
5,"Totally worth the pricePeople are just dumb 😑What else you expect from a product worth ₹69 (that too delivered to your door) , a gold sheetThe job of this product is too prevent the keyboard from dust, and it is doing that job succesfully"
1,"It is company packing but coming with folded in 1/4th of the sheet, which is give a line in because of this there is a gap in the sheet where dust can go in. I have checked it for Dell 5500. it is bit large for this full keyboard (6mm larger than the laptop, 6mm sheet came out of the laptop and disturbing hdmi and usb ports."
5,"If you are not finding this in your local shop then for sure purchase it from amazon.I got it in 69 rupees only.I would say according to price its not the best but its very good.There was no any adhesive kind of thing in my cover also i din't replace it .I just sticked it with the help of a black tape on my laptop keyboard and would recommend you to the same or you can use double sided tape if available.For my 15.6 inch it was half inch longer but i managed with ityou will not face too much difficulty in seeing the letters .At last i will recommend it , its very good and provide good protection from dust...."
5,Thank you AmazonFirst I was confused when I read reviews etcFew people sayingIt’s Pearl white not transparent oneOnly backlit keyboard laptops keys looking with help of lightOther laptop it’s juz whiteButI ordered I got transparent one
4,"It does not adhere to the keyboard surface. Also, the transparrency is quite poor, i cannot type with comfort with this on my laptop keyboard. The material is OK and is washable, which is a plus point considering how well it attracts dust."
4,"I recommend the keyboard skin protector.It adhers just fine on the keyboard, I tested, it does not move or fall off of the keyboard so serves the purpose.The sheerness could have been better because without the keyboard back light the world and not much visible.I am happy with the thickness. You cannot feel it through the keyboard while typing and that is good 👍🏻"
1,"Waste of money... Can be used only for a few days, then it slips off automatically from the keypad while using the laptop.. cornered adhesive is not that much strong. I used it only for a few days.. after that it's just a short table mat."
5,"Yes it is not that Visible ( Somewhat invisible).Due to so much dusty environment, I was looking for something cheap secure, and maintainable solution. Somehow I ended up looking at this and believe me you will not regret buying this.GO FOR IT BEST SOLUTION FOR DUST AND DURTY HANDS FOR YOU  LAPTOP."
3,"Oversized for my Tuf A15. But it's good. Better to say, not so bad not so good, it can be worked through. The adhesive is quite good and the keys can be pressed efficiently without any mess. Thickness, it's slim, not so thick and shearness is not so impressive but it's fine.Overall product is good for a Standard 15.6 inch laptop nor for a gaming laptop 😅"

2,"Cudnt use for even less than a month. The product says it can be reused and washable. Well guess what, it wouldnt even stick to the keyboard properly n kept moving. Thought would wash (i knw it was dumb) thinking maybe it may get some adhesiveness but nothing."
3,Definitely not for the people who have laptops with no backlight. I can barely see the keys through the cover when my backlight is off. Good for people who wanna practice typing cuz you cannot see the keys so you gotta guess haha.
3,"It is good but im not able to see the alphabet on the keys properly. Adhesion is not so good, you need to use tape. Bought it at 99/-. But now it is 59/- If you want cheaper one you can go for it. Its been 1yr and is in good condition."
1,"I purchased one such keyboard protector on 09 December 2016. It was delivered to me on 15 December. I am very disappointed with this purchase. After I unpacked and installed on 21 December 2016, I found that the keys on the keyboard were very poorly visible. I could not work on my laptop at all. I was forced to immediately unistal it. Tridib Ghosh, Kolkata"
1,"Not at all adhesive, it's just like keeping a cloth on the keyboard as it DOESN'T STICKS, NOR IS IT TRANSPARENT. Also , I too received a folded sheet. Also this doesn't fits my perfectly 15.6  laptop keyboard. I read all the negative reviews and expected this product, thought just took a chance buying it , but I see this is not worthy of any stars as nothing is as mentioned.NO ADHESIONNO TRANSPARENCYOVER SIZEDFOLDED"
4,The Product is good and easy to use. Without Backlighting you wont be able to see anything in the Keyboard. The size was a bit large for my Ideapad gaming 3. The product does its work.
1,Its not fit on 16in laptop keyboard as I have lenovo ideapad its way bigger for this key board and there is no good look to.
1,Very bad product not working but seller is good I have purchased my laptop from this seller and that was awesome I know we should not always judge the seller by products as some products are already cheap and bad quality I returned it.
1,Waste of money. Do not buy. Nothing works in this. Thrown away in 2 days.Does not fit.Does not stick.Can't see much .Keeps moving.Not comfortable.
3,"However good the quality would be it wouldn't work if you put a literal bent between .It bums up at the bent and took 1 month use to press down the bent.It is a bit oversized, but not complaining much cause it's price is cheap and I just bought it to get free delivery in other product and I got cashback so technically I got it for free."
3,Should've been proved somewhere around 60-80..I guess this is the cost one pays while buying things online..I have brought accessories like these for almost half the price from local stores
5,"Good product to use with comfort. Typing is not even an issue since the adhesion is really well. Had lockdown been not an issue, the product might have been purchased from local market at lower price. Doesn't matter, happy to have it."
4,As usual quality of the logitech keyboard is awesome. But the keyboard is having begnali alphabets printed along with english. For me its not at all needed and making some discomfort. Never mentioned this fact in the product description. Otherwise I will give it 5 stars.
4,"First of all, I bought this keyboard for home use because i use the same keyboard in my office, and this keyboard is really nice for this price.But the issue is, seller sent me a keyboard with Bengali letters printed on the keys (see the pictures) which looks very cluttered, which i didn't want, so be aware of that and ask the seller which keyboard they have.One more thing,May be i am wrong,  but i noticed that key stroke of this keyboard is little bit less quality of the one which i use at office."
3,"Not even 2 months yet and facing issue with keys.. letter f behaves erratically , sometimes not responding on key-press and sometimes keeps on typing (sending command for) f continuously automatically by itself.In short : either i received a duplicate product or a faulty product.[Update] : on complaining to Logitech, keyboard was replaced in warranty by them free of cost. Replaced one is working fine."
5,"It is very comfortable ,keys are good n if you want to learn typing it very nice n comfortable to learn typing...no problem for dat n the design is nice,cable lenght also no problem it's long enough ... supporting for windows 7 which am using ,em reviewing after 3-4 months of use no problem of connectivity,no loose connection problem of the cable... everything is fine guys ,finally one thing for learning typing better to take dis one it's comfortable n won't feel to come back when you start typing by using typing master....this msg is according to my opinion hope may be useful for anyone tq u"
5,Logitech is a premium and trustworthy brand so don't give a 2nd thought and go for it.It is a full size keyboard with elevated and smooth buttons.It can be used for gaming too because keys are like mechanical keyboard.Wire length is well enough.Quality is best.It has No backlit so can be a problem if you are typing in dark.Hit helpful !
2,Two stars overall for poor quality controlPros :1) This keyboard stays firm unlike the older keyboards which is a good thing. Soft key typing2) Design wise The Escape key is in a weird position compare to my older  K200 keyboard which takes a while to get use to. Not a major problemCons: Failed in 6 months. + key is not working and sometimes works automatically. Bad quality control. Keys are a bit wobbly. Swiss quality?
4,"I purchased this keyboard as a temporary replacement for my gaming keyboard, the Microsoft Sidewinder X6, which after serving me well for 4 years, is nearing the end of its life. This keyboard is a very basic one with no bells and whistles. For its price, it offers a very good build quality, standard key layover, and a seperate numeric keypad. There are no media control or internet-related controls, nor or are there any USB ports. It connects to the computer via a USB 2.0 port, but you can also use a USB 3.0 port. This is a good value-for-money product, which, for occasional users, should be a good performer. I am a heavy gamer, and with my usage pattern, this keyboard will not last more than 2 years. By that time, I am hoping to have saved enough to be able to purchase a mechanical gaming keyboard. The only negatives in the keyboard are:1. Its keys have sharp edges. Having rounded edges would've delivered a better typing experience.2. Typing fast results in a minor lag between pressing of a key and the related result appearing on the screen. I guess it is to be expected in low-end hardware.VERDICT: Good value-for-money product, but only for occasional typists and price-conscious consumers."
4,"If u are reading this review, if u thinking to buy keyboard for daily use, offical or Non gaming. So please ga ahead and buy it, before you are going that rabbit hole to buy that expensive keyboard.  This works boss, no fuss. I got this along with wireless mouse to attach to my laptop to work from home. Simple living. Keyboard is very good. Does not get struck or make liund noise. I want to thank a amazon review from Australia. He helped me understand that all I needed was this keyboard. Thanks for reading till here. And I hope you must me tired if u are like me. Go ahead and order this and sleep peacefully. Cheers."
5,"Good quality keyboard, feels comfortable to type on. The Enter key is ANSI layout, that is, it is placed below the backslash ('\') instead of backspace like in most keyboards which follow the ISO layout. It is also smaller and occupies less space which might end up being problematic.Other than that, it's probably the best keyboard in its price range (unless you prefer laptop-style keycaps). The keycap markings haven't been a least bit damaged and all the regularly used keys still function like new.Delivery was very good with a properly packaged package. No damages whatsoever."
1,The product description says it is spill resistant but it actually  it is not. i spilled coffee on it and it was at room temperature . i let t drain over night but it stopped  working one key by one next morning. also it is not smooth to type ever
5,"I bought this in 2017 December for Rs. 595, and today is 2020 November. Literally 3 whole years and this keyboard is still working absolutely fine with no issue!I'm an everyday PC user, on average about 4 hours daily is must for me. Yet not even a single key has stopped working.Don't hesitate if you're getting this anywhere around Rs. 595 because you won't regret!"
5,"Earlier I was using a Dell KB212-B which had to replaced after many years of use. Unfortunately that product was discontinued. The Logitech K120 is almost an exact replication of the Dell KB212-B - but minus the key noise. So, my fingers don't have to relearn key position. Also, the Dell KB212-B keys are bit softer to the touch. At almost Rs 800/- the Logitech K120 keyboard is more expensive to be sure but I feel the keyboard build and quality is worth the price. Note: This is not for gaming."
5,"Unlike people complaining about getting letters of other languages printed on their keyboards, mine has got purely English characters only. Overall the keyboard is working perfectly, the keys are pretty much steady. It's a charm to work on this keyboard. See, I'm a programmer and I work on it a bit much and it gets used a lot everyday, still it holds up very good. I don't know about extensive gaming perspectives but it's very much suited for coding and can be a very good companion for programmers"
5,I'm using phone 9 hours a day and I can peacefully tell you blindly by this keyboard and you will just love it.Please note Logitech is the OEM supplier four major brands like HP Dell extra so even if you buy a HP keyboard it is going to be manufactured by Logitech and name is printed as HP.ProsLightweight keyboardUSB connectorKeystroke is not too long or too shortOverall plastic quality seems goodProper full-size keyboard from a branded companyConsThere is no inbuilt form support that is the only drawback
3,"I bought this 6 months ago and the 'C' button sometime doesn't register. It's slowly getting worse and I think within the next 2 months the key will fail.Yes, I do use the 'ctrl+c' and 'v' a lot.Also this keyboard has no media keys or an Fn key. You'll come to understand they're needed once you use one with those leys."
5,"It was purchased by me on 12 Nov 2016 and it started giving problems around 15th October 2021I googled lifespan of Logitech Keyboards and it said 5-10 years so, it almost worked for 5 years for me (my keys weren't damaged or anything everything comes to how you use sometimes ; I didn't clean it much often and maybe dust & debris has made my keyboard act weird like randomly freezing or spamming a particular letter and not work or even on hard pressing the keys would just not accept my inputs)Overall I'm satisfied with the product I recieved on purchaseThank You Logitech Now I'm just sad and on the hunt of finding my next suitable keyboard that is cheap and long lasting !"
5,"I purchased this keyboard mainly for gaming. Though it is made of plastic the quality is very good at this price. I was going to by a Rs. 1200 gaming keyboard, but somewhere in my mind I was hesitating to do that. As at that price you don't get mechanical keyboard. But then thought to buy this simple keyboard as the review was very great. And I am glad that I bought this.By the way this keyboard works great for gaming."
5,"The keyboard is really good, the keys are really easy to type in. Overall the experience is very good, and there is a smoothness of the use of the keyboard. I am so happy with this, product. Typing was never my kind of thing, but this has reaffirmed my love for typing back again. Thanks to Logitech, for this wonderful ergonomic product and thanks to AMAZON India for delivering this in a less amount of time. My suggestion is to introduce this keyboard in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, etc, and other Indian vernacular languages."
1,"Back to Logitech after using other junk brands for some time.Edit : After 2 years, many buttons stopped working. Opened it up to see the circuit traces almost missing in many places. Seems like the traces just vanish after a while, rendering many keys useless. Very poor reliability."
3,"Initially I received a defective piece, the CTRL & RETURN key was not working properly.I request for a replacement which was done promptly.The replacement Item worked well for first 52 days. On the 53rd day suddenly it started giving issuesThe keys at the bottom are not working. Return window is already gone.Looking for getting it replaced from service centre. Any help is appreciated"
2,"After reading lot of reviews and and doing good amount of research i bought this keyboad, as many were suggesting this is the best budget keyboard. But it did disappoint me for the below reasons:1. Too noisy  If you are someone who prefer the click sound for every keypress then its not a problem for you. I prefer working in silent environment and the keypress sounds were very distracting for me while writing the code / thinking.2. Long key travel  For laptop users who are used to short key travel, this is big NO as the touch and feel of the keyboard is fully different and you may not like it.3. Feel of the keyboard  For the price we paid we cannot expect a premium keyboard but this one feels very cheap and rough while typing on it, not even worth 500Rs.Pros:1. If you like the traditional keyboard / mechanical keyboard with long keytravel and big keys and want to have them covered in your budget then this keyboard is for you.2. Easy to identify the keys as the print on them is big and bold and clean.As i have been using laptop keyboard for last 4 years, i found Dell kb216 keyboard a much better option as a secondary keyboard than the logitech one."
3,"This is not a great keyboard by any standards. But for a lil more than 500 you really can't ask for much. It's quite flimsy. When I got it first, the num-lock and scroll-lock keys weren't working. I got it exchanged. On the exchanged one I figured scroll-lock is not working. I didn't bother exchanging it again cuz other than when I use MS Excel, I wouldn't need to use scroll-lock much."
5,"I bought this keyboard to use during my summer internship as a programmer. For the next 3 months, the keyboard went through all sorts of stress-tests and boy did it come out victoriously! The keyboard exceeded my expectations in almost all areas. The keys are big, the presses are deep, the ergonomics are great and the sound of the keys is soft yet affirming. Logitech deserves several accolades for making even their cheapest keyboard a delight to use."
4,"Soft keys, with some noise, if someone sleeping in the room definitely you don't want to have this keyboard, especially the space key with some metal clinging sound. I use it for everyday work, so having soft keys are preferred over noise they produce. There is a noticeable flux in the middle due to the soft plastic body, its not a big deal anyway. Overall the keyboard looks nice, and have no sharp keys, the price can be tad lower, like 500 range."
1,This is possibly the worst item that I've ever purchased on amazon. The keys hardened so much in a month even with little to no use because of my university exams that it's impossible to type now. I didn't expect this from amazon.
5,"This is good for normal typing, in fact I used it for a few weeks before I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard. I had once typed 20000 words in a day using this keyboard, and it didn't give me any problem.It is suitable for normal use, the keyboard feels good - if you type 5k words a day or less, then it is a good choice, but for heavy duty use, consider using a cherry mx blue switch keyboard. For its price range, it is the best value for the money."
1,"after using it for few hours, randomly some keys doesn't work properly. When pressed once, it types 8 to 10 times and sometimes doesn't type even once. Had to return it."
5,It makes some noise while typing but I like it. The buttons are good and perfect ni size. There are enough buttons and shortcuts.I will edit this with warranty customer service details if I ever need one.
2,"Product description  and its invoice (still available on record) very clearly includes digital wired Mouse along with keyboard but the Mouse was not delivered. Keyboard was delivered and works fine.  Supposed to be Combo offer but wonder why Mouse was missed. At this price, without Mouse, the keyboard is too expensive and misrepresents value. Why hoodwink customers ? One can easily buy this keyboard for Rs500-600 at a local shop and also support them."
5,"This ergonomically designed full size keyboard is perfect for my heavy duty typing needs.The product more than meets expectations as it comes with a good quality wired logitech mouse.Much better than my Amkette mouse bought from Nehru Place.The lead cables with the keyboard as well as the mouse are adequate in length.Only con, not for me though, is that some users may find it noisy.I bought it despite not so rave reviews and am pretty satisfied with Logitech quality.I can now confidently buy Logitech K400 keyboard for my Ipad."
3,"Keyboard is not bad and though it is little noisy while typing, it is comfortable and able to type fast. However one problem I have noticed which is, when u hold the shift key on both side (left and right shift) and type the underscore key or few other symbols on the number (example - closing bracket on the 0 key) is not working. when you release one of the shift key it is working fine. I am not sure its the issue only with my keyboard. If it is general then Logitech has to look into this. I have never seen this issue on lenovo or Dell keyboard.Example: I wanted to type ORACLE_SID. for typing the first caps word ORACLE  I have to hold the shift key and I generally hold the left shift key. For the underscore, I always use right shift key with the underscore key which is near to 0. while typing underscore, right shift key I am not releasing as I have the second word which is SID in caps to be typed after the underscore. But in this keyboard I always miss underscore as I am holding both the shift keys."
5,"This is an amazing product at this price range. Got a keyboard & mouse combo for 599 and am totally surprised at the quality and feel. Is in no way less than a Dell or HP (I have used  them all) and the price is simply unbelievable. I have 4 keyboards (1 iBall, 2 HP, 1 Dell ) and none of them can beat this. The mouse works great too. If you are looking to buy a keyboard mouse combo, look no further."
5,"Keyboard is great. Nice for daily usage and typing work. 3 years warranty is awesome. It's spill proof, membrane keyboard.It is even better than those membrane keyboards with RGB and price tag of ≈ 1000 Rs.It is better than any keyboard in range upto 1000.Choose this keyboard if you are looking for budget keyboard.If you want better than this, go for mechanical not less.Final words. Don't lose gold for glitter."
5,"The keyboard delivered was as per desription mentioned.I wanted the standard keyboard (With out multimedia and other keys)  for work from home and looking for  same keyboard as in office and it served the purpose.Recommend Logitech over other cheaper products even though price  is slightly on higher note, one can easily feel the diffrence in smoothness of key stroke."
4,"The small foldable plastic underneath the keyboard of bad design. They broke within a month of purchase. Not talking about the quality of those, but the design is bad. But the keyboard is value for money. Feels great. I use it everyday for 9 hours at work. But I'd not go for this keyboard for gaming. It's great for workstations."
3,"This is a first day review.Working fine.Cable length is short as compare to my earlier Dell keyboard and its very thin also.worst thing is, There is no packaging on keyboard when arrived, only minor bubble rapping, bt still no breakage.price is high i think bcz of branding i think. frm my point of view it should b in between 400 to 500rs."
5,The product is very good but when I recieved the parcel and opened the box some keys of num pad were displaced from their position i.e. the button came out. But they I fitted them properly and are working fine.Packing was the worst part though it shows the year of import as sept 2021 packing looks like 2 year old. They box was torn from corner and taped. Seller should focus on packing.
1,"When I plugged the keyboards usb into my computer and then getting a message : USB Device Not Recognized, and also I have tried on other Laptop and Computers but getting same problem."
4,"It fits perfectly for gaming ideapad 3 new addition. It sits on the layout without any gaps. Nice product, price could have been less"
4,"The black colour doesn't let any light pass, so it's hard to see the keys in dark. Even though the keyboard is backlit the keys are not visible in dark. I suggest to go with the white colour. Other than that it's a good product"
4,"Perfect fit, protects from dust or water. Just remove when using at night as back lighting just becomes useless"
5,Fits the Legion 5i perfectly. Best to buy the transparent one if you want to use the keyboard in the dark with the backlight on.
4,"Capslock,Function lock and numlock lights are not visible. So bit disappointed. exept this, All things are good."
4,"But it fits the laptop , as most lenovo laptop keyboards are of full size and same layout"
5,"The product is good and useful, sits perfectly on keys been using for 2 month now , no complain"
5,Awesome product and value for money 💰
4,Product is good but not for backlit keyboards. it blocks the light. Go with transparent rather.
5,i didnt think it fit for ideapad gaming 3 but its perfectly fit for it .its look ossum under blue keyboard light .go for it .100 % worth it .
5,Perfect Fitting for lenovo ideapad gaming 3 ryzen 4600h 120hz variennt... The product is good but it should not be ranged more than 300rs...
5,Great fit for Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3i..But it would be hard to type but don't worry you'll get used to it
4,The cover fits perfectly but there were bends at the right shift keys sideAlso the cover blocks most of the backlit lights.

3,"Your Questions Answered :Did you reach here because you love Mechanical keyboards? - This won't make you happy, travel between the keys is less, and accidental key tap can happen Often.Did you reach here because of the backlight keyboard? - This is not for you, wont justify why it's not for you. the backlight situation is BAD.Did you reach here because you are a gamer and you like the way it looks? - Just run from this product, it's not for you nerd..So who is it for?For someone who likes, - Big keyboard cable, - Bad backlight, - OK typing experience.More Reasons to stay away.. - For some reason, the keys are multi-colored, yes it's not RGB, the letters through which the ""white"" light is seen is colored. - The Cable is huge and it takes away the look of your desk. - The backlight is soooo dim. the images are from a totally dark environment, yes it looks all good in pitch dark. but usually, you have a bright monitor in front of the keyboard. and this keyboard is so dim that it looks as if it's about to die.Overall:Usable but Wouldnt recommend.."

5,"If you're looking for a keyboard that provides a great typing experience and also feels like a mechanical keyboard, go for this one. I bought it and took a chance since there were no reviews. But go for it if you want a keyboard that is lightweight and also makes your typing faster."
4,i)Awesome keyboard good for gaming and very smooth really recommendedii)Top among its budgetiii)Only the back-light could be improved it would be perfectiv)The keyboard is membrane but feels more like a mechanical keyboardv)Currently typing with the same keyboard and it feels amazingvi)Premium qualityvii)I replaced my cooler master keyboard with this keyboard so i would recommend this keyboard for sureix)Being a fps gamer i feel very comfortable to use this keyboardThank youHope my review will help you chose......Keep Gaming Keep typingStay home Stay safe.
3,"Nothing to complain about the delivery service of amazon.But about this keyboard, 1. backlighting shoul be brighter, and 2. A palm rest could be added.I've been using this for a couple of days, keys feel good.I want to say one thing that don't treat this as a pocket friendly gaming keyboard, better treat this as a costly regular keyboard."
3,"I thought the keyboard which are good for gaming are are good for programming too..but that's not the case the R-CTR which is frequently pressed is shifted way into the corner ,in its place dedicated option key is placed ....for programmer a more laptop like keyboard is more preferable"
5,Good keyboard not a typical switch based mechanical keyboard but gives you the feel. Btw the key travel is 2mm which is not that much for those looking for more key travel but this works for me as I am not a hard typer.
1,"Five star for fooling people into buying this crapThe purpose of backlighting in keyboard is to highlight the keys in dim environments even at glancing angle. I should have remembered HP always makes the worst Ergonomic products. Cheaper brands have better uniform LED backlighting. The intent was to use backlit keyboard to quickly locate shortcut keys in video editing and 3ds max. The alphabets on the keys are very stylized in unrecognizable sci fi font, guess HP gimmick to lure in gamers. If you are hoping to get a backlit keyboard like on a Laptop, this is a waste. Here the backlighting becomes so dim with any form level of - day light, table lamp, even a monitor."
4,"When I received the package, then seal was broken. I didn't request a refund or exchange as I urgently needed a keyboard and the board itself was totally fine. This keyboard is quite value for its price. Build quality is decent and back-lighting is also okay not something to  write home about.Pros:1. Good feedback and decent travel making typing quite fun and enjoyable.2. I also play games with this keyboard. No latency issue or anything like that.3. The RGB gets the job done of typing in low light although it is not quite necessary for me.Cons:1. The build quality feels cheap. Although it is kinda expected at this price point for a keyboard claiming to be a ""gaming keyboard"".2. Random times both the enter keys gets stuck when pressed. This issue can easily be fixable at home.I haven't used any ""gaming"" keyboard at this price point so I don't know with whom to compare with. I am more of a Logitech K200 guy. I recommend this keyboard. Its an HP product so you can't go wrong with it."
5,"The keys are perfect. However, the backlit is pretty dim. Might recommend for gamers who knows their keyboard really well. The mechanical key feel is perfect and have great shape to it. The performance of the keys are superb. So far I've been gaming hardcore on the WASD keys and it works amazing. The key movement has a mechanical feel of a premium keyboard.Tip: For the fact if you're looking for a well lit backlit keyboard, this would not be the best option for you. For gamers, they keys are solid 10/10"
4,"Packaging:1. When I reached the main keyboard box, they had reused the hp logo sticker to close the box. While other straps of both sides were not even intact within the place. It was very clear that the box had been opened before.2. When I reached for the keyboard, the keys had lots of dust particles on in.Product:1.The keyboard is great for gaming purposes I guess because I bought it for typing purposes.2. Other than that, everything works great, the RGB is a lot enough and the keyboard looks super cool. The wire is thick and the USB is also of great quality.3. Overall, the keyboard is perfect!"
1,"- It's not ergonomic in terms of usage.- They keypress is pretty fast. That's about here the good parts end- LED Lighting is more of a fancy piece. Bright lighting and accessibility goes out of the window- To add to after 3 months, the keyboard has stopped working. Complete waste of money"
5,"Arrived in record time.  Very good quality keyboard, and the keys have a nice mechanical feel to them. The material also is quality stuff, and this is a good keyboard for gaming, typing or programming as well, as the pressing action is really smooth.Although not recommended for older people as the letters are very faint, and the backlight is quite dim. Overall a good keyboard for casual gamers and for regular use as well!"
3,"My personal review:-Pros:1. The keys are smooth.2. The touch is premium for the money.3. Feels good to type on it after a little practice.Cons:1. The keys are comparatively small. I had to do a little practice in order to type perfectly with this keyboard since the keys are comparatively smaller than the other generic keyboards and closely packed.2. The backlit in this keyboard is dim, not customizable to your favourite colour and the fact that the keys are individually not painted in white texts, it becomes difficult to type with it when you are typing in a well-lit room."
1,"Just like a regular keyboard, backlight is not that impressive and not bright at all under Rs. 899 price tag. It is just the name ""Gaming Keyboard"" but there is nothing compare to the other available LED boards which are much impressive under this price."
4,"The HP K300 model keyboard is said to be a gaming keyboard, whereas it's not. IT IS NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FIRST OF ALL. The click feel of this keyboard lies between a normal keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. All I can say is that, if you're purpose is completely based on gaming, do not go for this k300. This is a 25% mechanical and 75% normal keyboard. The only thing which i liked about this product is that the build quality is good.PROS: 1) Good built2) Average click feel3) Has height adjustable stands.4) Good cable and USB INPUT quality.5) Has good cable length.6) Keys are slightly taller from the base which does not hurt while using it for a long time.CONS: 1) Very poor backlit2) The RGB can't be customized.3) No surround RGB.4) Not good to carry around as it's heavier than other keyboards.5) Lock Keys Light is very cheap."
4,"This is for the people who are trying to get a good keyboard but a on budget, people who are also looking to get RGB or get a feeling of mechanical keyboard they can get this model. It does not have any bright RGB lighting it is just namesake. It has a  good build quality, cables are thick, Key strokes are deep to get a better feedback. It has 3 modes to change and it works on Mac and Android also. there is a feature to disable windows accidental keypress in games you can turn it off or on."
2,Poor lights and the keys are very close to each other. The space bar misses hits at times.You will always end up with lot of typos because of the close proximity of the key. HP Gaming Keyboard K500F is a better one.Happy shopping !
4,"The keyboard looks wellbuild..however durability mostly depends on luck; could work for just a couple of weeks or may serve me for years to come...BUT for what it's worth its awesome..I don't quite get why everyone is complaining about the backlight, Yes, it's PERFECTLY READABLY dim (exactly how I would set backlight brightness settings if I was given an option)...keys are comfortable and punchy to type and doesn't skip..no ghosting issues"
5,"A good keyboard is very important for any user. Ive  realized this after i made this purchase. Earlier i used more generic keyboards but this one, for its price, is a game changer. I totally love typing on this keyboard and will suggest this particular keyboard to everyone. For its price you cannot ask for more."
3,"Everything about this keyboard is good , the ergonomics , the feel and feedback ..but the brightness is too low ..can’t see properly when the room lights are on"
4,"Everything is good.  The feel while typing is great. The travel distance is good. The keyboard is slightly small in width which is a small problem for those whose hands are big like me. The keys don't repeat them, I mean they are accurate. The anti-ghosting feature works well while gaming. Overall it is a decent purchase. Just one little thing to consider is that it's backlight is very very dim. In the daylight conditions, we can see and type, in total darkness, the brightness of keys are enough but the problem comes when we need to type in the evening time, the key prints are invisible(doesn't matter whether the backlighting is off or on). This problem only happens in evening time, other than that, it is great keyboard."
1,"Don't be fooled by the marketing images. Can't change the keyboard light colour to one specific. Brightness is too poor. Without backlight enabled you won't be able to see any key markings clearly. Typing experience is average and nothing much to expect for the price it's being offered.  Can't see keys if there's bright light in front of you, for ex monitor or a well lit room."
1,1) The box was already opened. Seems to be they delivered somebody's returned product.2) Keyboard having scratches.3) Oneside height adjustment clip missing.4) RGB not working.5) Where is HPs protective cover inside the box?Please do a quality check before delivering the product.
4,"The keyboard is pretty amazing for its price but I did notice some rocking while typing which shows it wasn't manufactured right. It just passed the bar for gaming and isn't anything special. No mechanical sound or feel but is better than regular keyboards. I suggest going for cosmicbyte at the same prices for better value. The look is definitely very sleek and minimalistic which is good. The RGB on the other hand sucks, so if ur a big fan of RGB don't buy it. Very old hp product so it's expected but overall ok for its price. I mean it's only 1000."
3,"Key strokes are smooth, sturdy keyboard but bad keyboard base grip and bad key back light. Relied on the bright key board light picture in the product order page and got cheated. Wanted refund but option was available only for replacement. Returned the product and promptly received a replacement which also had very poor backlight. Looks like by design the product has very low back light. Not what I wanted or expected."
5,"Is it me or are the keys a little smaller in width? The key click sounds just like any other membrane keyboard. Surely looks mechanical but not. Lights are exactly like in the pictures. Has breathing mode but the colours don't change around. Overall, not bad."
4,The problem with gaming hardware is that Little things can impact a lot. I didn't like the key typings and the backlight. The backlight is just too low to be allowing someone to play in dark. The key presses don't look comfortable to me a lot. This might vary person to person but do expect a lot more from HP.
5,"1. Built quality superb.2. Keys designs help more to type accurately.3. Weight is also heavy, better than cheap-feeling metal lite keyboards at this price.4. Sounds good too.5. Wire is also bigger and thicker. 😛Only the backlit could be more, but it suits perfectly as Minimal.It was the best buy for me.And Amazon delivery was awesome too for the fastest delivery within 16 hours."
3,Keyboard looks is good specially for gamers but if you are looking for mechanical keyboard or your work mostly based on typing then don't buy this.. first reason is the keys location is not in the right place there are large gaps between keys and you have to set your hand according to this keyboard structure.. and second reason this is not a mechanical keyboard as they are showing in the banner this is membrane keyboard which is not good enough for typist.. I'm giving 3 stars because of 3 reason 1. looks 2. LED light 3. I got this at rs. 825 and there is nothing good in this keyboard..
4,The buttons are absolutely not visible. Backlight is too dull. And I am not exaggerating because I needed a keyboard with not so fancy/bright backlight. This one is okayish I would say. But still the backlight is pretty damn low.
5,"I don't write reviews of products generally. But this one, I felt I should write, because I liked how it feels while typing. I type a lot and often, but never tried a gaming keyboard. After trying this keyboard for a few mins, I felt I discovered this keyboard very late.  The make is tough, the backlight is uber cool. There seems to be no doubt that this will last."
5,I choose this cuz I didn't want too fancy looking full RGB aesthetic sorta looking keyboard which the market is dominated with.The board is pretty good though I feel sometimes that the light on keys Could've been a lil more brighter I suppose. But problemo for me.
2,"No ergonomics in this board, key heights are unnecessarily high, left shift key and enter key began squeaking after 11 days of use and the spacebar key has a weird flex to it, athe backlighting is stupid dim. The keys are not printed properly you won't be able to see them even in daylight. Also the worst input lag I've experienced till now of all membrane keyboards."
1,"Most of the keys are giving two output like m/n is giving mn, b/v is giving bv etc. Not at all recommend. I would have given this a negative rating. Total waste of money. Seller also didn't reply to my message. I will never buy from this seller. They sell defective piece."
4,"A very good product, anyone can choose this keyboard for its performance and price, make sure you receive a good product without damage as it can happen due to online shopping, backlight I would say decent enough coz u must understand that a product from reputed company comes out with several plans and ideas behind,so one cannot put all the best in a single product that too for low price,don't miss this price offer, good product to be honest with decent backlight XD"
4,The keyboard is perfect for me aslo looks like the expensive mechanical keyboard. although it is not mechanical but the keys are raised enough... the only thing that bothed me was the compact design. I used to use a standard sized keyboard and shifting to this reduced my speed. also the space bar should be a bit heighted as the other keys hide it and it was difficult to reach for the space bar with my thumb
3,"Good quality, no defects as expected but the backlight is just nothing more than a gimic. It is so dull you have to wait till night turn off all the lights and then you'll notice that it has RGB and even worse is you cannot use it without turning on the RGB cause the letter markings are also very dull. overall if you know to type or know your layout and in a very tight budget sure go for it else I would suggest looking at other bit up tier keyboards."
1,Guys Keyboard is a basic. Led lights on keys are dim even with full brightness. You can strangle to see the keys in darkness. Platform below keys has led. In the Product Ad they have shown bright Led patch that's misleading. It has dimmest led lights trust me. Don't go for it if you are going for Led effects.
4,this keyboard is very well its a good mechanical keyboard at this price range that to from a branded companybut the sad thing is you dont get any option to change the lights or any mods which can change the type the lights are present . this keybpard is for the people who want a cheap mechanical keybpard from a branded company with warranty . and you just gget a option to adjust the brightness of the lights present . thats ityou can go for it . the packaging was good
4,"The product by itself is great but connecting to the Mac through USB the common key does not work, while on the other hand connecting through Bluetooth it works quite wellA little pricey I would say but cause there aren’t many alternatives for keyboards with the number pad this is a good one"
5,GOOD
5,"Bought the regular version of this keyboard instead of the chrome OS version.The keyboard is lightweight, very slim but sturdy when kept on a desk or lap. Particularly liked the ability to configure and switch between two Bluetooth devices with ease.Although it has a plastic build, it doesn’t feel cheap.The keys have stickers for numbers and letters which is a bit unexpected given the price. Despite being sturdy, I would be careful handling the keyboard while travelling as it’s very slim.Overall, a recommended purchase if you’re looking for a Multidevice Bluetooth keyboard. Probably the best in this price range."
3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
5,"To anyone who is planning on buying this product here's my honest review:Pros:1. Looks as shown in the product picture,2. Keys are silent and very comfy, certainly better than my acer Aspire 5 laptop keyboard or the cheaper logitech, rapoo or portronics keyboard which were all around Rs.1500. I tell you typing experience on these are heavenly💕I fancy these bright colors even though I am an adult man so I ordered pink😍 an boy I'm 101% satisfied with my choice⚡(i specifically ordered it for typing, editing, entertainment and general use so it does wonders for me)P.S: May not be for gamers though as they prefer Wired RGB's but sheesh! who needs RGB's when you got such a cute colorful keyboard.3. Comes with battery for both keyboard and mouse 👍🏻4. Has many helpful shortcut keys. I especially liked the Broswer, calculator and settings.5. Mouse click is also silent and for some reason the mouse look like a sports super car lol but certainly in a goog way.Cons: Its minor but these are the only ones I can nitpick on. The slot of the receiver chip is exposed so there are chances of losing it if you often remove it and take it here nad there. And also the led in the mouse is visible and blinks when active so battery life may slightly drain faster. (Have to test it out forst though). But I'm pretty sure it will last over 3-4 months on regular-heavy use.Check the mouse picture for reference."
5,The product is too expensive.  However it’s very light and very very easy to press however looks like a toy a little. A little too much price tho.  Could be 1500 max
5,I bought this for my daughter. Its pink and works fine. Mouse is also good quality.
3,Usable for those with narrow fingertips.
5,Good...
3,Like this ptodect
5,For continous typing
1,"The reason why I have to work more in this WFH, is this keyboard. every time when I type anything on this keyboard it misses many letters. and soon after writing the long comments, I realize many words are incomplete or type incompletely/incorrectly.My personal opinion is to look for some other better options or go with a wired keyboard. I can't comment in there exists such an issue with every wireless keyboard or specifically with my model.Other worst thing happened to me is that I contacted Amazon on the day when the replacement window got closed.But what can I do, on that day I realized it was something that is happening very frequently and I can't work like this. First they said they will help me get it replaced as I am a valuable customer and later on contacting them back they started explaining me their policies.I this time I can't even visit service center, and even if I do then no guarantee they will get it done asap.So better buy any other product based on my experience with it.Thanks...."
5,"Here's my detailed product review (also testing out the keyboard as I type this!).Delivery from Amazon took less than 24 hours. Although the product comes in a see through packaging from Amazon so the original Lenovo carton is visible when you receive the product. Nothing that one should be worried about though.The keyboard:The keyboard is adequately sized. The key spacing is perfect to my linking and typing on it feels very smooth with no clicking sound from the keys. It features three LED indicators for caps lock, num lock and what appears to be a low battery indicator. Keep in mind though that the indicators don't stay on - they go off after a few seconds so it is difficult to tell if the caps/num lock key is ON by looking at the indicators. They do however clearly indicate that the key was pressed or released. Not really a pain point. The keyboard uses a single AAA cell that comes in the box. The physical appearance of the keyboard is alright - nothing very fancy. The keys have a frosted ""top"" with white lettering and the key edges have a glossy black finish. Stand out feature- it has a volume control keys on the top row!!The mouse:I have been using the Logitech m235 wireless mouse for the last two years and have grown used to it so the one thing that I notice with this mouse is the speed. I have had to bump up the mouse pointer speed setting under windows  to the maximum with almost any mouse that I have used. For this one I feel I may have to lower that setting. Having said that the precision and accuracy is really good for my work (I don't do any graphic/CAD design though so I wouldn't know if this suits those requirements). It runs off a AA battery that comes in the box and has a recess underneath to house the USB receiver in whenever you're not using it. It is also provided with an ON/OFF slider switch. Compared to the keyboard I find that the appearance of the mouse is better than the keyboard's with a neat glossy black trim wrapping around the mouse with matt black finish on top with the Lenovo branding.Bottom line: If you're looking for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse, you should go for it . Even without being a full multimedia keyboard it has Volume control keys that is a real plus point. I got it from Cloudtail for 999 as a lightning deal."
1,"Actually i don't like to Write negative feedback for any  product unless the product was fault or not worthy,And this Product With name brand lenovo but i'm not sure its Original,5 months only used this - 12 batteries replaced, okay i adjust that and used,And now Mouse Scroll not Working, its going to trash hereafter,This is BIGSCAM in eCommerce, it has Serial Number Informations, i tried to check with Lenovo website but the device didn't recognised,Cheap Product, Only Buy If its come with 600-700rs. offer, Don't waste your money!!Believe me, You regret it! Definitely its not worth your 1400rs."
4,"Value of Money, Good Product, if you use key board for any android device, first change settings under key board, and set remote key board then only your enter key word else while pressing enter key it reflect 'q'. overall nice deal, fast delivery from amazon got @ 850/- under lightning deal with 15% cash back."
2,"I Purchased this product because reviews showed me that the product have light indicator when the caps lock key is turned on or off, but this is not complete reality when you press caps lock key, light is blinked only one time to indicate that caps lock is on, it is not turned on till you press the caps lock key again like other keyboard.Because of which it becomes difficult to use MS Word, Excel etc where it is commonly used."
5,Awosme product. I m very happy to get this product
1,"Product box was not sealed, also the box was broken as if it was used previously.Important point is, this product has only one year warranty as per warranty card but seller has mentioned 3 year warranty.Keyboard keys quality is not good, keys are very delicate looks like it can be easily broken. Num lock and caps lock light doesn't remains on when keys are active hence difficult to guess if keys are pressed.Mouse quality is good."
5,"After lot of research I ended up purchasing this combo. Both keyboard and mouse are working seamlessly. Keyboard typing is comfortable. The led indicators on keyboard is tiny though and does not stay lit always, i.e. once activated, it blinks for couple of time and goes away but that's fine, atleast you will get the indicators while most other brand does not have indicators for all options. No lag while typing. Mouse is super smooth. Clicks and scrolls are both very good."
2,"The mouse is working. There is a power problem with the keyboard. Sometimes it is working fine, sometimes not. When not working, I simply rotate the battery in connected position, then it works.Numlock indicator supposed to be lighted continously. When it is pressed, indicator blinks for about five seconds, then go off.Suggest me what to do."
1,"Product looks good,Fast delivery.Keyboard & Mouse paired very fast.Mouse work fine, but Keyboard is not working properly.In Keyboard CAPS & NUM lock LED indicator are not staying, when you press button, LED comes & goes off immediately, due this You cannot know whether CAPS & NUM lock ON/OFF.I returned & replaced the product, still the same issue continues.If this is expected functionality of the Product, then it's very bad product design."
1,"Do not purchase!This is the second set we have got, as in the first set, mouse was faulty. At start, the set worked fine. Next week there was major lag between the Keyboard, the mouse & the receiver. We thought it was the battery so we changed it. It ran fine then again the same problem persists. We thought the battery was bad so we changed it again. But then again the problem persists. I understand i'm out of return policy or refund & don't mind the cost, but the set is bad & shame o n Amazon & Appario to sell me this equipment. Do not purchase!"
3,"Writing a review after using the product for a week.Well, it is great to be honest. Does what it is intended for. The mouse is good. I am very particular about the grip and sensitivity of the mouse. I have used many wireless mouses and not all of them are good. This mouse may well be used for gaming as well (better than average but not exactly comparing with core gaming mouse)They keyboard is a bit of a let down. The range is weak. It loses connectivity if the adapter is not in sight.I am using it on my mac."
5,"I made this purchase 2 years back and only once I replaced battery for keyboard notfor the mouse, by the way I don't use that mouse as my primary mouse and one thing is noticable as I used this keyboard for gaming all the time."
1,"I was expecting a cheap keyboard but not so cheap. Keypads are stiff and typing a sentence can take ages even for experts. It will not last more than year I’m sure if used more than 5-6 hours a day.. keyboard and the keypad is very compact and has nice design .. but what’s the point when one has to struggle to type. I may end up throwing or donating it away to someone. I sincerely request people not to buy this model, spend some more money to save all the money on other product. If one does have too much of work then may think of buying. Quality is very cheap."
5,"The keys are not very plasticky and has a quite a bit of travel as one would prefer from a desk keyboard. The keys are soft and pretty responsive.The mouse on the other hand is a bit too light, which I am not very fond of, but is very responsive and smooth. The buttons provide a good feel and overall the build quality is satisfactory.Coming to the battery life, it’s running for over two months now, without any problems and the claims by Lenovo  on battery are yet to be justified.The keyboard cannot be turned off, there is no switch for that, but the mouse has a switch to turn it off or on. I haven’t turned off any of the devices yet from the time I bought it, and I use it around 9/10 hours everyday with the new work from home norm. The battery is holding up pretty good till now."
5,This product is good and easy to use and lightweight. You can use this product for typing fast and also having a good feeling that we are using on PC. Nive and quality product.
1,"Keyboard misses several signals. Cannot type fast. One has to be very slow. At times, it just hangs and one has to wait several seconds, before continue to type. Sent a message to Lenovo Customer Care, but no response.I have tried on 2 laptops, one being brand new.Laptop is placed just one feet away and receiver is plugged directly into laptop. Tried changing battery also."
1,Keyboard is hard and stiff. Not at all easy to use. Unfortunately this happened a month after purchase I.e. after the window for returning the item has closed so basically there's nothing one can do but grin and bare or throw the keyboard out. Sucks!
1,"Everything was all good, worked well initially, layout, feel, etc. all suited me. BUT then, suddenly I started noticing missing key strokes. I thought it is battery problem, changed its battery to new Duracell Ultra but then also it didn't worked.This problem is making this key board unusable. It is in warranty but don't know whether they will accept this or not plus running to service center during this pandemic time is also not a good option. So, within 1 month my money is wasted and now nothing but an e-waste."
4,Awesome keyboard. Right size. Best thing it has single usb connector for both wireless mouse and keyboard so saving another usb port for other usage.Keys are a litte hard and not very soft but i think it will get soft with usage.Happy with the product. I got it forRs 1190. Review on 1st day. But since it has warranty i m not much worried.
2,"This keyboard results in erratic keystroke capture. It seems to be completely whimsical working perfectly sometimes and not at other times.I sit away from the laptop (about 8 feet away). Did not face this issues with my earlier keyboards.This can be quite irritating when you are typing more to only realise later that letters are missing.The other issue I see is that the Caps lock and num lock light dont stay on.So not sure how this feature helps, especially Caps lock. The light simply blinks and turns off.I started to type this review as the keyboard again gave me a problem with all keystrokes not being captured.Funnily, while I typed this review, it worked flawlessly."
4,"I bought this since i own a Lenovo all in one desktop PC. and the Keyboard and mouse that came with it was broken.1. The build quality is no where near the keyboard/mouse that I got in box (same lenovo brand) with the desktop PC. Having said that the build quality of this mouse/keyboard not that bad either. The keys are ergonomic and good. The mouse keys are good.2. Like many people mentioned in the reviews, the caps lock and num lock indication lights glow and turn OFF and do not stay ON as required. Probably an issue with the hardware.3. Overall its a decent buy."
2,"The keyboard is absolutely fine to type, but doesn't come up with a wrist pad that would be too beneficial to type for continuous long hours without affecting wrist. Moreover, it's un-usable in the nights (without turn-on room lights) becoz doesn't come up with led display. The real problem comes with the mouse. that's absolutely worst, useless, and I totally end up in wrist-pain. Please be careful in purchasing these two items as the return policy appears to be scary."
2,"the keys are hard to use and put a lot of pressure on fingers. They are not made for long use.After a 2-3 months, the ctrl-key got stuck. Then a few more months down the line, i have a case of missing letters.The warranty is not at home and in NCR it is either in Ghaziabad or Delhi.the mouse also started having problems with right click after sometime.Would not recommend it to buy."
3,First delivery did not work properly with some keys on the keyboard not consistently working and erratic mouse movements. Suspect problem was with the Bluetooth dongle that was part of the k/b+mouse kit. Replacement (same make & model) was promptly delivered and works without a problem. Soft-touch keyboard (membrane) takes a short-while to get used to but is OK once familiar with it.
5,"A very good product (keyboard and mouse) in this price range. I found it user friendly. I now use it for my full day work. So far no problems.Suggestion- provide caps lock indicator light near or on the button itself, having it near Num pad does not help much...Escape and other function keys can be bit bigger but not that big dealGiving 4 stars on Ergonomic for Mouse size."
2,"The keys of it is nice. Ergonics is very good. But it is very bad for gaming, when I play video games, the keyboard just disconnects from the computer automatically and then I have to remove the battery and then again put it in the keyboard and then starts to work again. It is so annoying to do this again and again. For gaming very very poor, and for daily use, internet browsing and office, it is average."
5,"Excellent choice of keyboard and mouse for this price, can be used for office and gaming purpose . At first the mouse looks small but the premium feel makes it better, I would say the mouse isn’t the issue ( big palms user ).Used the keyboard for my thing as runs without delay and very smooth, used for gaming (FIFA and Valorant ) very good performance they’re too.Great prod at this price point."
5,Reviewing this after using my first Lenovo 100 for more than 2 years.Now I have purchased it for another laptop.Goodness of keyboard -Full size keyboard.Conventional lay-out with proper space.Smooth buttons.Goodness of mouse -Standard size mouseWith on/off switch.Buttons and roller working so smoothly till day.Long battery life.
2,"The product looks beautiful and sleek. The keys are large and needs a little bit to get used to. My main problem was that there were a lot of missed keystrokes. It's not just when you are typing fast, you have to type really slow to register all keystrokes. I have used a logitech wireless keyboard + mouse combo and faced no such problems. Disappointed in this product as lenovo is a trusted brand. The mouse works great though."
1,"After 6 months of use, 8 times out of 10 the keys are completely unresponsive, changed to new batteries but didn’t help, the keyboard is never more than 6 feet away from the receptor, be it gaming or watchin movies it’s frustrating at times, the left click on the mouse gives away too easily, had to change the settings n now using the right click, no durability or longevity."
4,"It's not for gamers, as it feels a little delicate for that but for someone who has to type a lot. It's not heavy at all, I can take it in my lap and type all day long. Quite easy to use. It's sleek, simple and smart just what I was looking for. A perfect no nonsense keyboard and mouse combo that means business. The only let down that I felt is build quality, it could have been a little stardy, keyboard feels a little fragile apart from that it's maska.... Thanks lenovo, thanks amazon..."
3,"Perhaps due to typing on another keyboard, I am having difficulty typing but I am trying to change my habit of hitting hard on keys. Backspace and enter keys give troubleOtherwise, with light strokes, it works fine. It is a minimalistic design and perhaps the cheapest keyboard mouse combo of Lenovo.I Will take time to comment correctly"
5,"Recommended. However be informed, that the power in the mouse doesn't switch off automatically, when the computer is switched off. Should be manually switched off. Even cheaper mouse, from Portronics, i- Bell switches off automatically if left unused , and starts automatically when booting. Keyboard might have the same defect, but I didn't check that out till now."
2,"Just after 4 months of usage, the keyboard became unresponsive to the keypresses - it just did not recognize the keys being pressed.. So I replaced the battery (i used a fresh DURACELL AAA battery) on the Keyboard and then for about 2 days, it was a little better (though at times it still did not recognize some key presses)..Same issue I faced with the Mouse piece as well.. it became unresponsive after maybe 7 months of usage.. Changing the battery on the mouse piece, it was back to normal..Lesson learnt: stick to the company who has been manufacturing keyboards for a long time now like Logitech or Microsoft or Dell (maybe even HP).."
1,"Item was delivered on Delivered 31-Mar-2021, Return window closed on 07-Apr-2021. Worked great in two weeks, now keyboard is not responding when I press keys. I have to press it multiple time to get response. I can't even return this item, my money is wasted. This is really bad item, didn't expect this from brand like 'Lenovo'. I would recommend you to buy some other keyboard, even mouse performance is below satisfaction level. Buy it at your own risk."
3,"The quality of the product is really nice. The only issue with the product is that the keys have become hard to use and it becomes really annoying if you type fast. You have to keep going back to correct the words.Mouse is very smooth and doing a good job so far.Also, the keyboard is well covered while not in use.."
1,Situation Rport - 1 Month of usage - Cannot go too far away from the dongle - A lot of typed letters missing from output ( This reviw was made with this product...) - Buttons are getting soft and flimsy - Not fun to type!Regrtting the purchase. Assumd that Lenovo would sell reliable and useful products... Apparently NOT! :(
3,"Dissapointed with mouse . The mouse is very small even small than a kid's hand.it has a bend in its design which doesnt allow you to click properly.it tough to take the chip out of mouse,but the keyboard  is  faboulous it has a shine on it's keys ,it's a little bit small but doesnt require much effort to click on keys ,the keys are not popped out as it is in wired keyboards the legs of keyboards also allows it to stand up till 2 cm which is same as wired keyboards(most of the ).. overall mouse is not good and the keyboard is awesome"
5,Amazing keyboard ..really looks very well..well packed..the brightness of lights are also well . Really like it
5,"Pretty much the title. I was looking for something cheap, reliable and at the same time ""cool"" and this hits the spot."
5,The upright buttons are very comfortable to type and operate on
1,Damaged product and rgb not working
5,This Keyboard is best for gaming. I like this keyboard because of it's keys brightness. Brightness is too high & Perfect.
5,"Guys I would like to tell that this is the best keyboard as it's under budget ,very comfortable and beautiful"
5,"I gifted this one to my brother & he gone mad after seeing its light effect. Keyboard quality is good & very much attractive. I must say its best buy at this price. Key & Board material also made with good quality plastics, hence overall I liked this keyboard very much. Thanks Amazon."
5,"The quality, durability, feedback and accuracy of this keyboard is amazingly on par with those that cost almost 5x more than what it costs. Great keyboard at this price point. You get more than what you ask for. Typing experience is just amazing."
2,"This is not original dell product, its copy of  Dell product. When i scan QR code on box its directing me to fake unsecured Chinese dell page and key board is also not looks premium..I purchased this product for ₹900 which is over priced for duplicate Chinese product"
5,"I had an older cheap keyboard which went out after 3 months of use. My main purpose of buying this is for its durability. I am a S/W developer, so needed a good quality keyboard within a budget.Pros:- Feels durable, the keyboard keys are a bit tight (when compared with a laptop), but I got used to it in a few days. The keyboard is near silent, doesn't make all the clickety noises like a chicklet keyboard.- Mouse size is just right. My palm rests exactly as I want it to while fingers are just in the right position (I have average sized hands so it may differ for others). I don't know why people complain of having a thumb support. It makes the mouse heavier and not easy to move. All the buttons have the correct feedback as a pro mouse should have. Its also light which makes it easy to operate. The accuracy is good.Cons:- The spacing between key groups has been reduced so when I come home from office, it takes some time to adjust. Example when I intend to hit delete, I was hitting end most times. But you get used to it.- The signs printed on the keys seems like some sort of sticker. I hope it doesn't come out.- Shallow key travel, so I have to put less force (less than a regular keyboard but more than on a laptop).For the price, I think this looks like a good and durable keyboard. I wanted a simple one without all the multimedia stuff and this fits my requirements."
3,"Product quality is good enough as par the cost price.This is a very classy, minimalist and attractive combo."
1,"Absolutely disappointed to receive ONLY keyboard... when we were waiting for a Keyboard and Mouse Combo!!!Positive part is, since it was COD order... The bill arrived was for Keyboard ONLY.But I am absolutely clueless, why my order is got altered without any prior update???"
5,"i bought this primarily for the keyboard and the mouse is a backup as my current ones are not doing very well. i repair the little copper spring after the clicking stops functioning normally but I never know when it will stop completely. anyway, this keyboard is great to type on. i'm an advertising copywriter and have to type a lot and this is very good, almost like the apple keyboard."
5,"-Keyboard is very sensitive and very soft keys-Doesn't produce sounds while pressing keys so thats a bonus for me as i have a lot of typingMouse is medium size , needed a little bigger as my palms are full size but can work with this too ."
4,"The keyboard quality is good. As you can see from the picture, it is quite small. If you have smaller fingers, this will be comfortable for you. Otherwise get a bigger keyboard."
5,"I bought this item since it was a bit difficult for me to type on my laptop keyboard while looking at the second monitor. On my laptop, I usually type about 55-60 WPM and was able to reach 47 WPM on this keyboard on the first few tries.The keys are good and with some adapting, I think, it would be perfectly fine for typing in general and even touch typing (the F-J markings are a bit faded than what I would like though). There is minimal latency and typing feels smooth.The mouse is pretty good as well. Very basic in terms of design but does its job just like it is supposed to. I am using it with a mouse pad but I'm pretty sure that it would be fine without one as well if you prefer it that way. It is priced close to a thousand and I would say it is value for money. It is not only a verified brand but quite popular products from the brand so if you are looking for one and this fits in your budget then go for it."
5,"Keyboard and Mouse both are superb! Reason all keys are butter soft smooth to press, caspsock/numlock/scrolllock keys have good led light indicators ii is white light which is better percicable by eyes than green LED indicators. Qulaity if material is far better.REASON OF PURCHASE: I had purchased muliple new keyboards for office of another brand just beacuse they offered lower price, but i totally regretted my decision all the keys were getting stuck when pressed poor light indicators, and all the keyboards started malfunctioning within six months. Poor qulaity material used."
5,"The keys were not too big which is great and very comfortable, it was good value for money because you get both keyboard and mouse really cheap. The products seem sturdy although the wires seem slightly flimsy and thin.Combine this with a USB hub for a perfect home office setup"
2,"By the image the product looks like a soft chicklet keyboards like laptop keyboard but its not.The keys are far more harder then the laptop keyboards.Its just like a normal keyboard so if you are planning to buy a soft keyboard for productivity, coding etc then you might get disappointed buying this."
5,This model keyboard and mouse is given to employees at work. So I had experienced its durability at work so bought for home PC. Very rough and tough. Very durable. Very reliable product by Dell.
1,"I purchased it since I wanted something for casual use. The mouse is okay but the keyboard is absolute trash. Sometimes keys don't disengage - pressing a key once keeps pressing it again till I tap it. Most times it doesn't register keys while typing fast. It's very difficult to type passwords reliably with this. If your daily use constitutes more than 3 sentences, don't get this. I'll suggest getting something else."
1,"Not even single star.There is no office combo of keyboard and mouse by dell they are combining the individual product, but even though they charging more man MRP.(keyboard-449 and mouse-299 total is 748) but the amezon prize is 850 for combo."
3,ProsSlimNo noiseCheapDell brandBig and comfortable mouseConsThe bumps on F and J is not noticible. You have to add a manual bump.No multimedia keysWhite light strain the eyeskeyboard lift is so small that there's no benefit in using it.
1,"Mouse edges are not properly finished, low quality plastic used, scroll wheel is also too hard, keyboard quality is goodMouse wheel not working after few months from purchase"
5,"Still using the same combo.It has stood the rigors of my professional work and personal use. And a whole lot of travel. And the occasional guests who check their emails.Excellent, highly recommended!"
2,"Tempered seal, lot of execuses in packaging damage, delivered opened product. Not sure how this is Amazon choice product. Dissatisfied with keyboard. But mice is good."
5,Great products from Dell. I have been using the same model for around one year and it is still working without any flaw. Good typing experience when compared to other Keyboards I had. 100% value for money. The independent key model will improve your typing skill as well. Also Mouse is so precise while working on editing software. Overall good experience.
3,Few keys stick in when pressed and this started happening just after couple of months.
5,Loved it. Was fed up of buying keyboard every year due to issues.The same version of keyboard and mouse i had used in office and wanted to buy this for home use. Have been using for more than 2 years and absolutely no complaints. Would buy it again 10/10 times.
5,"I ordered this combo here and was very happy with the delivered product,... The only problem is this was an unlucky mascot for me as i lost my job right the day i got it delivered 😂"
5,"Ergonomic, value for money, comfortable. Ideal product for home and office use. Loved this product from Dell."
5,Highly durable product from Dell. The products are erogonomicallyndesigned and perform well after continuous usage.
3,Keyboard is good and I use for my daily use. I am using mouse also but bit disappointing. Mouse right click sometime stuck inside and i have to hit it 2 or 3 time to again come to its usual condition.
1,"PRODUCT AUTHECITY ISSUE , ITS OLD STOCK BRANDED KEYBOARD.Message for Buyers: Its not doubt this is Branded product , Brand is reputed .But its your luck as these are old Keyboard"
5,"I liked the keyboard, however the mouse was not as comfortable to hold when compared to my logi mouse."
2,For 1100 rupees you could get Logitech soft keys wired combo. But this mouse have too hard to press buttons.
3,After using for 6 months now the keys are getting stuck. Mouse is nice but keyboard I won’t recommend.
1,The keyboard stopped working within 2 months. Not worth the buy. I didn't expect such low quality from dell. It's outside the return window so now stuck with junk.
3,new key board with all keys making more noise and mainly they sent used mouse some one used mouse its not a new one so i returned it but corrier guy not ready to pic bcz that mouse is old one never buy plzzzz
4,"without any problems.Good purchase by me.Purchased the same product ""Intex Corona Slim USB Keyboard Water Spill proof  and Intex Optical Mouse Little Wonder Black USB with 1 year manufacturer warranty "" ---- did not work. All waste."
4,Very well designed and comfortable to use.only downside is the elevation support do not make any difference.
4,"Overall keyboard is good and smooth as I expected. but bumps in keyboard are very poor, it's very hard to recognise the bumps in keyboard."
3,The key travel of this keyboard is short if you are coming from a regular keyboard it can be very odd to adjust to this keyboard. Otherwise it is a good keyboard but it is made in China.
4,"The Keyboard and Mouse are decent looking the price. However, personally I feel that The Amazon Basics combo is better and the price is also a little cheaper for Amazon one. Have to check on durability though."
4,The packing was good.. the product is perfectI am very happy with the same
5,This product is fully original & from Dell. Very nice product. 👌 Thank You Dell for keeping it up our trust & returning our money if the product is really not working.
4,As usual dell keyboards are the best for daily office use
5,"1. keyboard is extremely good for typing looks premium and classy.2. Using same mouse with my another pc for last 3 years, working fine so ordered it for my new pc."
1,The box seal was broken at the time of receipt. Returned.
5,"By far the best keyboard and mouse I've used in my life, it's silent, customised keys make it a great typing and clicking experience you can have. I bought this for ₹ 2750, little higher price to pay for a keyboard and mouse combo, however I've no regrets, this is actually worth every penny."
4,Product is good for long hour work. But I am not sure why do we get a Dell product with open box . My replacement is also an open box but no issues with the keyboard. Not sure how the warranty works if it's already delivered open with batteries open.
5,"Writing this review after using for few days. Great product developed by Dell, I am enjoying keyboard and mouse. Mouse works on glass surface. This is amazing. Can not comment on battery life."
5,"Initially ordered Logitech mk345 but the keyboard was sometimes lagging, so returned it and purchased this dell product with 3 years of warranty with exchange program.Have been using it for more than a month and as of now working fine.Did not face issues or lag while using it almost 10 hrs per day. Mouse is good for bigger hands as well."
1,There is no usb adaptor to connect with laptop or desktop. In dells offical website its given that mouse will open from top and inside the adaptor willbe there but this mouse opens from bottom and there is no usb adaptor
5,"Brilliant KeyboardGood key travel, excellent feedback, silent key strokes, good ergonomics aswellVery good range, of both mouse and keyboardUseful shortcutsHighly recommended for productivity focused"
3,The caps lock indicators are too tiny and go off after 4 seconds. The caps lock/off notices that appear on the screen stay momentarily to be of any use. Creates problem while typing passwords.
5,The keyboard and mouse are great the typing experience is good and also the time travel. Mouse is also good. And you can also change the function of programmable keys in keyboard and mouse using the software.
5,Really good quality material as well as superb packaging.
5,Excellent keyboard . I think the best of all the brands available in India.I am writing the review with the same keyboard
4,"Best chicklet keyboard. Smooth typing experience. Can type for long hours.Only downside is,it doesnt have backlit. Else its a 5 star keyboard."
4,1 star down as the seal was already broken. No damage found in the product and both mouse and keyboard works well. This is worth for who expect a wireless keyboard and mouse combo for work. Not for extensive typer or programmer as ergonomics is not great. Customisable keys are useful though..
2,I don't know I got opened box from amazon as all reveiws mentioned alredy but everything worked so I didn't replace
3,There are no issues with the lag or keys missing or mouse movement. Easy Plug and Play.However for the price point - the product is just average...that make could have been better.
2,"Keyboard is not as soft as I expected, I earlier used Logitech, which was better and cheaper but was dead in 2 years. Mouse is excellent"
5,Very comfortable and functional.
5,Super Product...i would recommend everyone who want to buy keyboard and mouse...Go for it..excellent product. Am Happy
1,If you press Caps Lock the indication light just blink and stop .
5,Good
4,Keyboard has soft keys which are easy to type. Mouse nicely fits in the hand.
3,"The keyboard keys are silent, but the key pressing is not smooth and feels rigid sometime. Sometime keyboard lagged too."
5,Excellent product in this budget and worth of buying...
1,Don't buy this particular product this was my Third time return to Amazon
3,Like:Backlight at this price rangeDislike:Can not change lightNo breathing effectcan not increase/decrease brightnesskeys print appear to be dull in dark with backlightpainting quality is poor as I can see patches in many keys and it gets off with little scratch
4,"Update- this keyboard supports PS/2 port, which is good since they say ps/2 ports being old provide excellent signal/latency response etc.so after a few weeks of using the keyboard, I can give a near final verdict on this keyboard. The printing on the keys has started to fade, and while actual gaming, the key input speed is indeed slow if not different(works good with ps/2 port), there's a work around for windows users, in control panel, keyboard settings. About the sturdiness, I put a lot of pressure during gaming, I mean alot, keys did make a creak and so does the body, it's yet to break or won't. Will give a final 3 or 6 month updatePackage was packet well. Now about the keyboard. I don't know of any keyboard priced so aggressively and delivering way above its price range.Keys are rubber dome, you are getting anti ghosting and fixed rainbow colour lighting, as mentioned on pack, no options to change lighting effect or brightness, also, the product shown and recieved is not the same..doubt replacing will change anything as this seems like a revamped version of the old. Very lightweight and flimsy, but we don't bend keyboards anyway..many body finish imperfections, can be improved, they show keys as removable, but this is not mechanical, so not much point unless you want to add custom keys worth 2000 for a 650 keyboard. PLUS, I tried removing the keys, they are delicate, I see strain marks on the plastic inner clips..so avoid doing that on this if you want all your keys..So if you are on a budget, or you often break keyboards the toto wolf way, then go for it, plus anti ghosting and rgb at a very good price, I think the best entry level, being membrane, feedback is good, not bad at all.So if you are on a budg"
5,so good typing and best gaming keyboard
3,"What do you expect from a budget rgb keyboard?Price point wise. Ok.No Mechanical keyboard feeling at all.All keys are too soft. Very lightweight.The paint on the keyboard start fading. Bad.The rgb colours looks better in the dark.Conclusion: Buy it because it's affordable. You can't get a decent rgb keyboard in this price range. Overall, buy it. Cos it has a freakin RGB. 😂"
2,"I replaced the keyboard twice before finally getting a refund (took just 2 hours). The keyboard review videos use an earlier version of this keyboard, with breathing effects, dedicated lighting button and translucent front panel. The keyboard I received was very thin, fragile, creaky and flimsy. It has no backlight button, it uses cheap plastic and flexes while typing. You can spend less than half the money and get more durable membrane keyboards (though without RGB). They charge you double for the RGB which itself is of poor quality."
2,"when i bought this keyboard. it was not in proper condition also the box was also mostly damaged . after buying this i realized that the right arrow key was pressed down and would not come back up. another thing, this keyboard randomly turn off after like 30 seconds so you have to key the RGB lights on so that you know when it is turned off. also there are useless key in this key board. the most useless product i have bought offf amazon"
3,The keyboard has easy keycaps and the RGB lights are awesome. There is no breathing effect and when you press fn+light it doesn't change to other mode but the light switches off. No extra light features as shown in the pictures. Even the keyboard is not that stable on the table! Recommend for budget gamer who wants less featured keyboard.
5,To be honest the keyboard click sound should be a bit louder It gives semi mechanical feel while typing and as far gaming is considered and you're on strict budget go for it This membrane keyboard supports all games perfectly and  I played Pubg PC on it I was amazed as it was far better than the cheap normal membrane keyboards
1,Good
5,Too good..led light good one .value of money.I am impressed. Key functions is better for other keyboards.Total great product. Thanks to amazon and Zoook Concord.
3,I thought i would get custom led that i can keep it myself but it have only a single option. and they delivered a different one comparing to the one in the picture. And I  Gave 3 star because i got this on cheap price and to be  honest i cant expect more in a low rated keyboard.
1,The light emitting from certain keys is so low that we have to stare to view the keys correctly. Not satisfied with this.
1,Back light is not powerful enough to make the letters visible.Button spacing is a problem.Build quality feels cheapI wont recommend buying this product
5,It is too much good and creative. While playing games it is awesome
1,Light for LED keyboard is not working.. what’s the point in buying it.. never expected this from Amazon..delivering an used piece
5,Its the best keyboard in amazon under 1000 plz buyyyyyyyyyyyyy and its great greattttttt
1,Sensitivity of the keyboard buttons is very low performance. Some keys are not working means struggled working condition.
1,Worst Quality ever had to return this keyboard on the first day only. Don't buy. Not at all Value for money.

1,The keystrokes are very bad
5,"very amazing keyboard,RGB is just awesome."
3,This is not like that what see in image
1,Some keys does not work properly
5,Nothiing
1,Don't buy waste of money
4,I use for gaming
5,"Just a perfect product for my Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-54). Its too slim and transparent, which doesn't affect the lighting effect of keys. Perfectly fits the keyboard with key to key. Perfect size for the keyboard. Easy to use. Came in good packaging. Overall loved it very much. Can go for it....."
1,Feels like used. But it isn't. The quality is very cheap. Used other products earlier. They use to have a self adhesive (very mild) which will sitck to the laptop keyboard. This product is so cheap it doesn't has it and it will rather stick with your fingers. Irritating.
5,"First of all, it doesn’t sticks to your keyboard so you can pull it off anytime and clean it. But since it doesn’t sticks to the keyboard, shaking the laptop and air can detach it. Also, you couldn’t get the feel of clicking of buttons. But if it doesn’t matters to you, you may go for it. But the build quality and sheer strength is quite good. You can go for it if you want to."
5,"I bought for PREDATOR HALIOS 300 2020 Model (PH 315 52)I Like Most:1. this is super thin and good quality2. doesn't blur or dim the keyboard lighting, see the attached images.3. key alignment to fit ratio is completely perfect. They done a great job here.4. doesn't capture fingerprint or smudges, so display will be safe.Only one cons price should be little bit low.You can definitely go for it."
2,Don't buy this product if you don't use an external keyboard it makes typing experience very hard.will do the work of just protecting your keyboard from dust and water and cost only your typing experience.
4,The first one I ordered was a little loose and had a bit of a ridge in the middle which I had returned. The replacement product I got fits absolutely perfect. The only issue is that it has a matte-like finish which feels a little odd to me since I don't like that texture.
3,Product works well. The only Con. I find is that it is folded from one side of it such that it overfolds the buttons & do not insulate them properly... Hope they use better quality to give it heat insulation or atleast protection
5,Product is perfect no complaints it fits perfectI cannot Complain about price if the quality is good and it fits but could have been little less in terms of money.
4,Product is good I bought it for my acer predator triton  300 . Received just now. First impressions were nice. I will update after uses whether it's water resistant and dust resistant.
1,It’s transparent to pass the keyboard backlight. But it is still whitish. Looks bad on laptopIt’s not clear transparent as in the image

2,"So I have never used a mechanical keyboard prior to this so keep that in mind while reading this review.First Impressions-It feels awesome and smooth, i never want to go back to using normal membrane keyboards ever again.ProsDecent switchesAwesome mechanical feelGood fontsMedia keysConscheap build qualitycable is not braidedBig keys do not have good stabilisersThere is no software so limited rgb functionalityVerdict-According to me, if you have never used a mechanical keyboard ever before, definitely go for this one you won't regret. This is the best you can get for the price right now, it is better than any membrane keyboard out there.Not sure about longevity will update in a few months.The cons are trivial and to me personally don't matter. Definitely go for the keyboard as it feels really light1 month updateD key's switch stopped giving clicky sound and became muddy and started getting harder to press, it works just fine but it feels like its malfunctioning, i replaced the switch to num lock since keyboard is hotswappable so not a huge issue, taking one star off my reviewAnother update- 2 more switches became muddy and clicky feeling went away. This keyboard switches suck ass i dont recommend buying this at all stay away from this..."
5,Absolutely awesome keyboard ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Mechanical Keys are so good🤗🤗🤗🤗Excellent Packaging 📦
5,I was a little skeptical because it was cheap. It has very decent build quality and the keyboard has blue switches. Feels like an authentic good mechanical keyboard for the price.
1,"Don't buy cheap products ,My 'W' key stop working within 1 months. Go for Logitech or Redgear or other trusted brands .They Don't have any warranty on their products .They don't have service centers in my city . I googled about their service centers , I got to know that they have service centers at Delhi only."
4,"I have been using this keyboard for a day now, It came in a good packaging, the keys are smooth and are audible enough. The lighting mode is great and works like charm. In game experience is great, the response time inside game was better than cheap membrane keyboard. Though when using multiple functions using the dedicated function key, My keyboard became unresponsive, the mouse works, I think the keyboard works too, it just that my PC that is not reporting the registered key. I unplugged and re-plugged the USB cable (which by the way is great quality build for the price point) and it resumed working, I will have to check again if it becomes an frequent issue or an one time event. The built quality is great considering the cost and not average as many reviews state. It is fully mechanical, not cherry MX but has B23 switches, which gives a soft feedback with a soothing click sound(Similar or comparable to mouse clicks). Will review it's reliability after checking it for some months.Edit: I found the unresponsiveness was my lack of observation, I accidentally pressed function key with lock sign thinking it will lock my computer and take me lock screen but instead it locked the keyboard, as mentioned earlier, my unresponsive keyboard was my own doing. Have been using it for a month now will update after using it for a few months."
5,"Bang for 1500/- bucks.Its real mech keyboard, not fake mech feel likes.How it lasts like tvs gold.## update after 10months,keyboard multiple keys are not working, whereas my TVS gold 14months old works as new, TVS also uses Chinese mech switches but much better quality....TVS should add 1k more to existing price of 2.7k and release German MX switch keyboards as older TVS gold standard...I am not going to buy any chinese mech switches anynore, quantum, readgear, xyz...etc"
1,"After  6 months of usage, letter 'I' has lost its backlit.Most of the time some letters wont register while typing.Rupee symbol is printed on the wrong key."
4,Video Player is loading.
3,This keyboard even though it is blue mechanical switches keys are very wobbly and you and key stabilizers aren't doing a great job... Which is managable for small key caps but for the medium and large key caps... It's very prominent. There is a good amount of keyboard flex.. and the tactile feedback is there... But you don't feel it.. you just hear it. Also the keyboard layout is different so you need some time to get used to it...Pros1. It's a good entry level keyboard because for its budget2. It is RGB backlit keyboard3. Has a good length to its usb cord4. Adequate amount of rubber footpads5. Is a full size keyboard for this price point is solid.Cons1. For prolong use your fingers might feel fatigue as they are on the heavier side of keystroke...2. Keyboard has stabelizers but doesn't do the job well...3. Since it is RGB backlit but... It's not fully customisable and has 12 different preset modes.4.the backlit switches are not as bright as I was expecting to be...5. The key stroke is tactile but not smoothConclusionIf you have high hopes on getting a mechanical blue switches... This keyboard won't leave you satisfied on the tactile feel aspect but does the job.. I'd recommend to look for other alternative for the same price bracket.
1,"Guys, please giving fake positive feedbacks. This is the worst mechanical keyboard I have ever used. Previously I have used keyboards by TVS gold, Cosmic Byte, Ritcomp etc. This one is the least accurate and slowest. The keys are wobbly, especially the space bar. I mistakenly ordered it seeing the positive reviews. I should have gone for better brand not the price. Useless Purchase. This also dos not have return option. Please see the review and then buy."
3,"It has NO Menu key, has a background light changing key instead. should have had the key as I was used to use the key for opening Menu Tjust as a right click of mouse). If you don't have budget for TVS keyboard then only go for this. The sound of the mechanical keys is significant, specially when someone is used to less sound of membrane keyboard."
2,"I originally looking for a mechanical keyboard because I play alot of rhythm games and VSRG's(Vertical-Scrolling Rhythm game)  so this looked nice and I bought it, however the blue switches take too much force to use(if you want to tap really quickly) and there was barley any difference between this and my laptop keyboard. The keys are also delayed alot and its very, VERY loud. One thing I really like about this keyboard is that it has so many RGB options that is it is so cool.  however i was disappointed with this because the keys were extremely loud, i cant even press 4 buttons all at once some times, and the delay of the keyboard"
5,"For those complaining about the wobbly spacebar: take the spacebar keycap out, bend the metal stabilizer on the keyboard inward slightly and put it back. The wobbliness is due to no friction from the metal piece.Other than that, this keyboard is sturdy, clicky (though noisy) and is great for coding and gaming. The shortcut keys up top can be custom mapped in Windows or Linux. For $20 / ₹1499, you can’t really complain as most mechanical keyboards are above ₹2000 right now."
3,"This is my first time using a mechanical keyboard so I can account for the problems i felt because of not being used to it, but the keys are too wobbly and the noise is loud and obnoxious. The backlighting is good, the keys work well otherwise, which is a decent buy for the price. However, not a good purchase for working purposes/personal use apart from gaming. The size of the keyboard is far bigger than expected in terms of both length and width, so best works with hand/wrist support."
4,"gaming is good i would have preferred brown switches..you can swap the ""WASD"" for brown switches from cherry mx..the smaller keys are well stabilized and produces a satisfying click( if u are into that otherwise u might find it annoying)but the right shit and the space bar is not well stabilized and producers a metal janky sound and is not as springy as i would like it to be..the backlit is fine with few different combination to choose from...then comes the cable..i will say it is decent..just decent...then comes the enter key...that thing is wobbly.....oh oh there is another small thing..sometimes the input of ""WSAD"" and the arrow keys gets Interchanged...pluging it out and then in solves the problm..happened to me once...and the rubber pad are not very grippy so there is some sliding here and there"
5,"I got this delivered yesterday and the Initial impressions are that it is an excellent keyboard. It is very well made and has a nice weight to it. The keys are comfortable (the backspace, enter and shift keys are of the perfect size and dimensions) and tactile offering great feedback.The lighting effects are fantastic (Earlier I used an ANT 3400 mechanical and I think Quantum is far superior - for one, it remembers the last light setting on the keyboard). Various useful multimedia/special options are available on the function keys. I really hope this one lasts me for a long time!"
1,"The normal keys are good but quantum needs to fix the other keys like Spacebar , shiftkey , etc. Otherwise RGB effects are very nice.Edited after a month: So I just replaced the keyboard after 4 days because I having issues with the shift+w key so I thought there must some problem, so I just replaced that keyboard with the exact same model so when I got the new one AFTER A WEEK I used it the keyboard was working fine but the nest morning I had again the same problem SHIFT +W was not working properly. The conclusion is just don't buy this keyboard invest 2 thousand rs more and buy Logitech gaming keyboard which I m also going to do that."
5,Nice and sturdy keyboard. Just go for it👍
5,"GOOD mechanical  KEYBOARD only 1499 with a multimedia key function.fully N key rollover ( tested). Windows key lock.just I receive my parcel, but no //invoice inside. the sailer should be providing that.  good keycaps & over 1kg of weight this keyboard.all the key is used in this keyboard are tactile type( nothing registered without full press down).overall good keyboard.+6"
1,keys stop working after you use them for a while and overall key quality is not good go for good membrane keyboards in this budget
1,"I buyed it on 27st July and after approx 3 months ,many keys stoped working and many keys spring wire is missing in product. I'm am not using it for gaming, I use it for daily use as coding. Keys presses are good but for me it was wasted just in few months.Light options are there but those are not relevant to me , the lighting patterns are like some festival lighting, those may looks good but not for practical use. build quailtyis good.ruppee key didn't worked for me.Looms good but how long will it work, that is not sure ,if you will ask me. If you want to invest money, I will suggest to explore and find more durable product."
5,"I am very happy with this mechanical keyboard, especially at the price point it offered. After seeing YouTube reviews of this item I thought let's give this item a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the keyboard despite it's low cost. The light is nice (although color is not per key - but at this price you can't complain). Backlit keyboards in this price range usually look somewhat tacky, but this somehow looks classy despite not being expensive. The keys are reasonably designed. If you are looking for a cheap mechanical gaming keyboard - this is one of your best choices.I rarely write reviews, but this was good enough for me to write one."
2,While plying valorant and CSGO i discovered that many keys pressed at a time do not function... such as shift walk backwards you cannot equip from pistol to rifle and so you die doing that.... This is too annoying. why should I pay for something thats not even worth the price. Even my office type keyboard was better than this at least it worked that way.
5,"I've been using this keyboard for almost a year now, Ive gotta say... this is definitely one of the best keyboards that I've used so far.The build quality is decent and the keyboard feels very sturdy. The key caps may feel a bit cheap but you can always replace them (hell, you can replace the switches too).The rgb lighting is nice, and the click-y feel of this keyboard is absolutely divine (I think that this probably the loudest mechanical keyboard on Amazon, Ive tried quite a few).Overall this product completely surpassed my expectations. I can't recommend it enough, its an absolute bargain."
4,This mechanical keyboard is well-made though the multi-colored LEDs make it look a bit too flashy. A subdued look with single color lighting would have been much classier. The keys work passably well and the overall design is sturdy.
5,"At 1500 there is no better choice than this mechanical keyboard. Before ordering this I was very sceptical but after recieving the product I was quite impressed. Packing was fine but there were some smudges on keyboard because it's made of plastic. Lights on switches are bright and doesn't look cheap. Amazing clicky noise but it may disturb your family members, so if your budget is around 1500 blindly go for this there's no better option available now"
1,After 3 months of normal usage. It types random keys when you press anything. Not worth the price
5,"Works perfectly, the only drawback is that backlight is not that prominent anymore(only visible on borders not on letters)."
1,"Dear Sir/ Madam,I have purchased this product through Amazon online shopping.  I liked this product. I am using this product for laptop. Now a days, I have some issues on this product. When i press some keys, some strange characters appearing on the scree insted of letter or number.I hope you will replace this product for me. It is undef warranty period.Awaiting for your reply.Thanks,  Best RegardsAbhilash"
3,"First time when I got this order, I got it in good condition but when I start using it, I notice an issue with the keyboard. When you press ""R"" on the keyboard it display some other alphabet. Same issue happened while press other words and numbers as well.Looking at this issue, I had asked for replacement, which I got after a 1week almost and when I got it I was shocked to see the condition of the packaging. It's was damaged completely and looks like someone has stuff the keyboard and mouse inside the box and tapped it and sent it. BTW the package seal looks to be already opened and later Tapped them. See the photo which I attached.I wanted to return this product and replace it but looking at the fact the delay which happen last time when I replaced, did feel like doing it again.My point here, when you spend certain amount of money on something, you expect to be good and well presented...."
1,"Worst product i ever buy. From Amazon part they delivered product on time but the product from seller even after replacement didn't work. Mouse & keyboard both goes off after two minutes of idle , i have to remove Bluetooth every to get connected again & Even u r connected mouse have too much lag.Stupid part from Logitech that mouse don't have any button to kept it manually on/off & Bluetooth is too big not like conventional Bluetooth it is just like pen drive .If possible try to avoid  this model."
1,"Design is so worse that we will definitely start using Laptop's keyboard again...1. Poor design2. Special keys (Backspace/Insert/ Arrow keys, etc) are stuffed into too little space3. Borderless keyboard4. Not friendly to typing5. No light indicators for capslock/numslock/low battery lifeMouse1. Heavy as you insert 2 AA batteries2. Look wise good3. Age old design of the wheel.DONT BUY...."
1,I can understand the need to save space but this keyboard is ridiculous. There is no caps indicator nor is there a num lock indicator which is extremely inconvenient. The delete key is a tiny button placed right up on top (next to the function keys). I just cannot understand how anybody can type on this thing. I tried to pass it on to unsuspecting colleagues but got a mouthful. I requested the seller to send me a better keyboard and that I would pay them the difference but to no avail.
4,"Concidering to the price point of 999/- lightning deal it was a good deal,, only cons what i think, there is no notification light in keyboard and arrow keys are very small definitely not suitable for the gamers,,, but overall in performance 5/5"
4,"I purchased similar logitech keypad and mouse around 4 years back. That time this product keys were some old fashioned and also the keyboard had sharp edges and was too sleek to handle. I didnt have another option looking at the price and delivery and opted for this. To my surprise, this keyboard has curvy edges, the keys are lovely and feel awesome while typing. The mouse grip and shape is super. The only flaw in this i would say is Capslock light. Only if this had a light for capslock, i would have rated 5 stars. During this electronic age where we use lot of net banking and online transactions, we cannot risk giving wrong passwords. But at this price this is an excellent product.Thank you Amazon, Thank you seller, and most of all Thanks to the delivery person."
1,"I can tell you this right now that if you're are looking for a sturdy replacement for your keyboard. This product is definately not it.1. The package is an absolute garbage. Both the product recieved was seemed like stuffed up product as is the delivery boy just picked up the product as a return and delivered it to another customer.2. The make of the product reminds you how Chinese manufacturers just are dumping crap in our backyard and even getting paid for it. It's all made up a plastic. I felt the only redeemed product is the mouse and felt it made the cut.3. The length, width of the keyboard and travel space of keys are just so crappy that it will leave you retyping everytime you use it.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
5,Awesome product I like this product very much as it is very helpful for those who want to use it wirelessly this is the best wireless keyboard in this price range as it offers more than its price only the thing that I didn't like was there are no LED is all over the body of this product but the plus point is it enhances the battery life and also it is only for professional use and not for The Gamers
5,"Working on laptops these days is a routine job. You are on a roll when it comes to your job! Thence, it is very necessary to get your hands on keyboard and mouse while you are working on Laptop. There are several reasons behind getting them. The major one being, since you work so much on your laptop, it becomes sometimes difficult using the mouse on the laptop. Also too much of work on the laptop makes the keys of the keyboard weak and they stop to function properly. This causes a lot of repair and maintenance expense.Therefore, it is important for you to get yourself a keyboard and mouse combo. So, logitech mk215 is the best."
5,"Super Awesome, I was so worried seeing lot of NEG reviews of defects and replacemens however I got it today and working so fine .. very handy keyboard easy to carry, keys are smooth.Mouse works smooth too. Completely satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Pros:1. It connects with Computers, TV and Phone seamlessly. (Usb port is a must for use)2. The battery life is impressive as i have not changed the batteries (supplied along with the set) since i started using it over 6 month month back.3. Compact design for a full sized keyboard is very impressive and looks good.4. Key pressing response and Mouse clicks are very good.5. The overall range of transmission is quite good as i have used it at a distance of 300 cm between transmitter and keyboard / mouse without any issues.Cons:1. There is lag in mouse whenever the bluetooth transmitter is placed behind the computer thus i advice to place the transmitter at a place where it has no obstruction between transmitter and keyboard / mouse.2. Please do not buy it if you are planning to do average or heavy gaming on it will not suite that. There are gaming specific keyboard / Mouse for that."
4,"These are a good alternative to my old laptop that sits at home with a broken keyboard. But if you plan on travel with it,don't even look at it.This is a good wireless keyboard for a budget.Pros:Wonderful keystrokesTyping is blissGreat performance / no disconnect or lagWorks with linuxLightweightMouse is light and nimbleCons:Little flimsy as a whole. One drop may break it.The arrow keys are badly placed, numpad could've been left out making the keys better.Not a deal breaker but cannot game on these.Mouse left click sounds different but works fine."
5,"very affordable and qwality product, logitech devices are always well built and works out of the box without issues... batteries were also included by logitech.... since the keyboard and mouse works on 2.45 GHz, they interfere with home routers working on same frequency...."
5,"Very good, compact, light keyboard. Only mouse is a bit heavy. No ON/OFF switch for both keyboard and mouse to save battery. You need to get used to this if you are accustomed to working with bigger keyboards. While keeping your hands for typing be careful about your thumbs positioned for using the space bar.  Keys function smoothly. To use The ""Rupee Symbol"" which is combined with the 4+$ key, you must look forward appropriate language settings and combination of keys to be used."
5,"Brilliant product , good quality ;1: mouse is very responsive .2: I have never seen such a good scroll button and soft clicks.3: keyboard is thin , light and very responsive .4: its true that it can be used from a 10m range ( I have tested it).5: just plug the Bluetooth stick and you can use it instantly.6: worth buying ( I would give it 6 out of 5 if I could ).I am satisfied with the product ."
5,"It is a pretty decent keyboard and mouse.  Detects and works within seconds. I have tried it with my mobile as well via the OTG, it works perfectly fine.The only thing which i am not happy is the size of the keyboard and size of few buttons. They could have gone with the conventional keyboard size which would have been more easy to user. Anyways you get used to it within few days."
1,In the six month of buying the keyboard the key such as U and S key when I press  then it typed the other characters and the computer is hanged. The function key is also not working and one numeric is 4 is not working . So the problem of this keyboard is the malfunctioning of  various keys. The other problem is that the numeric key 0 when i press it stuck.The one of the most problem is that on this keyboard the typing experiences is  very bad. So don't buy it.The model no is mk220 and amazon shows it mk215 why?Go for other keyboard like Hp . Worst for money.
5,"Best part is it comes with 2 two batteries.Pros:1) Very sleek and elegant.2)Unified wi-fi  di dongle.3) Very closely packed keys = less key travel + faster typing speeds(depends on your qwerty familiarity ofc).4)Dedicated multimedia buttons for fast access.5)Almost silent key press noise. But that depends if you're in an office or at home.6)Easy to grip and ergonomic.Cons:1)The up and down arrows are squished into a single key space.2)The mouse first feels very light but when u add the 2xAAA batteries, it feels heavy and also diminishes the weight distribution. That is hardly anything to complain abt once you're used to it.3)No backlight (ofcourse) cuz without lights it gets a tad bit frustrating for moderate pc users.4)Main ENTER key is really small. smaller than those on laptops... but again that you'll probably get used to it.5)No lights for capslock or num lock.I think this is the best deal for a wireless keyboard+mouse combo.Must buy.FUNFACT: I am writing this review using this keyboard. :P so yes it is NOT defective at all."
1,"I purchased it on 23.05.2020, After receiving I found there is no Caps Lok Signal. Nub lock Signal, scroll lock signal, we need all this indicators in current scenario for passwords. second thing its Number Lock  not a proper, you have press its after each & every 5 minutes . its really unsatisfactory a Logitech is reputed brand in keyboards % mouse .I already Purchase it Rs.1500/- during lock down period. Do not purchase it. Waste of money"
4,"I was initially planning to buy the Dell keyboard + mouse combo but it was not available for delivery in my area. That's when I decided to go for this.I'm not facing any issues and the keyboard keys feel good to use. If you like the feel of good old PC keyboard, then this one is ideal for you.But if you prefer soft keys, then you might want to consider the Dell one.Also it does not have a premium look. But its a good full size keyboard."
5,"comes with batteries for keyboard and mouse. both connect using one dongle. assembly is easy. size of laptop keyboard so might be difficult to adjust but for me it is comfortable. very satisfying to type on. i have connected this keyboard to my apple laptop and most of the functions like (windows +c) instead of (command + c) can be used. good quality mouse with three buttons (middle one to scroll, and the normal left and right ones) there is no light in the keyboard and it is very light weight but good for its price considering it is wireless and comes with a wireless mouse too."
5,"I was building a PC for our office colleague, they wanted a modern yet powerful solution for mouse and keyboard. The idea of buying them separate might be annoying as they both get separate receivers and have to connect them in two ports. It is not a problem but a modern solution is not that. So, I went for this Logitech Combo Wireless MK215 pack.Firstly, the packaging was so good. Nothing distorted and nothing unusual. All good.Keyboard: The keyboard is so smooth and noiseless. The key clicks are very operational and snappy. A new kind of keys are used. These are not like the mechanical keys but are very much buttery. No sound for any click at all. Even the space bar has no sound when you type. It is very much essential for any meetings where you need a quiet environment and even the keyboard typing sound becomes annoying. So, here you go, the soundless keyboard. Battery and keyboard installation was easy. All the things were in 100% good condition. Ergonomic design - means comfortable typing for hours. I type with 50 WPM, and it's so good for me.Mouse: It is the most advanced, minimal and modern mouse I've even seen. Exclude the Logitech MX master, that's too advanced. For anyone working from home or even for office, this mouse is well suited. No wires. No clicky sound. No laser lights from mouse. It is very very responsive and has ""INVISIBLE OPTICS"" - directly means no laser from beneath. Ergonomically designed. People like me with bigger hands can easily use this mouse.Receiver: ONLY ONE! Yes, only one receiver makes it up for both keyboard and mouse and they both work so good. We tried simultaneously working with them and it received those signals too. Very responsive and good feel.Keyboard is ultimate. Mouse is modern and super feel. Receiver is working best. No installation havoc and no wires. Absolutely stunning solution for anyone, who wants a wireless working setup.Keep an eye on the battery life, as there is no battery indicator for both as it is on the Apple Magic Mouse or Keyboard. The batteries might last for 24 months in the keyboard, because that experience with keyboard is amazing. Mouse batteries may last for about 5 months.Apart from these, it is the best solution for any office who needs wireless combo."
1,Product is good but delivery was very poor.  I received after 12 days with crushed package. Disappointed greatly on AMAZON PACKING. The seal has broken already. Keyboard looks modern but mouse isn't like that....... It is not easy to use if u already used single battery wireless mouse... I shocked at this packing.
5,"It has very tiny 'up, down, right and left' buttons. Enter, Backspace & Delete keys are smaller than normal.But you can't complain much because the keyboard only is supposed to be small as expected. so they have reduced the size of these important keys to make the keyboard small.For gaming of any sort which needs the direction keys, this keyboard is not the right choice. Good for all time word processing and web based duties.This mouse does not have an ON - OFF button - takes 2 pencil AA size batteries but last for more than a month. I use rechargeable batteries so I have no problem at all even if it lasts only for 15 -20 days. The Mouse is very good though.The USB dongle is the normal large one.. not the nano usb (thumbs down for this)"
3,"The product is good but Not suitable for multi-media purpose. It's small in size but I should have checked that before buying. The wifi connectivity is poor when I kept the CPU under the table and plug this gadget in the rear end. It does not work. It works only when It's plugged in the front USB. Sometimes the connection is slow with editing platforms. But once I got used to it, I am able to use it."
2,Logitech is a brand name and one expects a quality product. The first keyboard I received caused so much havoc with constant mistyping that my PIN got locked. I requested a replacement and received a new keyboard within 3 days which was great. The new keyboard seemed to work fine but has started giving similar issues. It randomly inserts Caps or odd letters or spaces while typing. You have to keep removing the pen drive and re-inserting to tackle the problem. And this occurs at least once every 2 days.Please don't bother with this product. It only looks good.
1,"I purchased this keyboard in Jan 2019 and now I have started having issues with the key. A letter ""A"" is gone bad and it types the letter ""a"" itself without pressing it.The bad part is that I tried to contact the Logitech customer service but their number seems out of service so finally I wrote an email to them 3 days back but still no response. Really bad service."
4,"Buying it the second time in 8 months and completely satisfied. The keyboard is pretty compact, but meets my need. First buy was in Jan and no issues so far. Mouse needed battery replacement after 6-7 months, keyboard still going strong.Bought it again for my wife now, bit disappointed with the delivery though. The box arrived without any external cover(waterproof), partially drenched in rain and box open as well(see pics). However, nothing was missing and its functional too.Giving it 4 stars due to the bad delivery experience the second time around, else it qualifies for 5 stars at this price point."
5,"I had purchased a wireless USB keyboard + mouse in 2018 or 19. While moving homes, the mouse got lost. I was using a wireless keyobard with a wired mouse on my secondary computer. Recently I decided to upgrade all computers, bought this full set.Pros:Product works like a charm on Windows, Mac and Linux. I tested on a a Dell Inspiron with Windows 10, a MacBook Pro with Mac Catalina/ Big Sur; a  MacBook Pro with Linux (Manjaro, Pop Os) and also on a Raspberry pi 3.Four words to describe the experience:Works Like a Charm.Thanks Logitech for an awesome product. Good battery life, thanks for sending the batteries too. Sometimes getting one set of batteries is a challenge.Cons:This unit uses both AAA (Keyboard) and AA (Mouse) which can cause a bit of hassle. My only gripe so far."
5,"I have been looking for a portable keyboard that I could carry around with my ageing MiPad tablet so that I could type papers on the go at coffee shops or in the library without having to lug around the weight of a full sized laptop. My search began with many brands that I saw tech reviewers showcased most of which were way too expensive or not even available in India. I narrowed down to a few Logitech keyboards and I am of the opinion that Logitech makes some of the best PC accessories. The K480, K380, and the newer K375s were the ones I had my eyes on.Build Quality:It is build really well although it is made of plastic, there is nothing to worry about the build. If you have held the K480, it is pretty much the same build, and not very different from the K375s. It seems it can take some rough usage, in my opinion. (Disclaimer: This does not mean you don't take care of the device at all.) The construction of the keyboard is solid.Battery life:I haven't had the keyboard long enough to give my personal opinion on it, but the reviews online do say that it lasts for months and I don't see a reason to disagree. It takes two AAA batteries to be powered which is easily user replaceable when the batteries they come with are depleted. I'd like to see a micro-USB charger with built in batteries for the next iteration of this keyboard as this is my only gripe with it.Form Factor:The K380 is by far the smallest and the most portable of the lot. A more comparable one in terms of form factor would be the K810 which is priced substantially higher than the ones mentioned earlier. The K480 and K375s are decent alternatives to this keyboard if portability isn't your first priority. The K480 has a built-in cradle to hold your device which was tempting to me, but I preferred the portability of the K380. The K375s has a full num-pad too, so it is the least portable of the lot which is not to say that it is not portable. It is quite portable too. So choose what functionality you'd like and pick the one that suits you.Typing Experience:The keys of the K380 are round as can be seen from the pictures which may seem odd to some since most keyboards have square keys. This is probably an attempt by Lenovo to make it look retro which may be off-putting to some. Aesthetics is not something I am going to share my opinion on, but I can say that the keys are almost as comfortable as the ones on the MacBook Air which is saying a lot since MacBooks are like the gold standard when it comes to keyboards. The round keys do not in any way hinder the typing experience, it remains the same as on normal keyboards if not better. The key travel is also tactile and not shallow which provides for a better typing experience. All in all, the typing experience is as good as on the MacBook Air, maybe even better.Compatibility/Connectivity:The connectivity is really good. It is compatible across all devices in the mainstream market including Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. If you are worried about compatibility, don't. You'll be just fine. The pairing process is as simple as pressing on of the yellow buttons on the top left. You can pair upto 3 devices at a time and switch seamlessly between them (this is a feature that exists in the K480 and K375s as well). This is one of the USPs of the keyboard. In a scenario where you have to type on multiple devices, this is a blessing to have. Take for instance, I could type this review on my laptop while I have my paper open on the tablet which I have to type too, and moreover I could reply to my texts on the phone without having to move my hands away from the keyboard as long as I have all of them paired up. Switching to devices is as simple as pressing on the corresponding yellow button on the top left of the keyboard.Pricing:Having read the review, if you are convinced you want one. The pricing could be another factor that helps you decide. I got the laptop for ~1200 which is a steal and as low as I've seen the price drop, so if that's the price you are seeing right now, I'd ask you to go for it without any hesitation. But if the price is ~1500, you can take your time to deliberate upon your decision. If it is around ~2000, please wait for the prices to fall.For the price range of ~1500, this is the best portable keyboard, hands down.Please do hit the ""helpful"" button if this helped."
5,"It’s very good looks wise & also buttons are round shaped. Typing is not great but it’s good enough. You can connect 3 diff devices seamlessly with just the press of a button. Light weight. I’m using it for my mobile, IPad & laptop as well. Works smoothly with all the devices. Bit a pricey, but u can get it at low price in lighting deals or festive sales. Go for it & you won’t regret. Thank you. If you find this review helpful plz appreciate it by liking the review. -Sri Tech Guy."
3,Connects very easily and functions very well with very low power consumption. It is also remarkably quiet and can be used in crowded environments without disturbing others. However:1) It is remarkably heavy.2) The keys have very little play and so you tend to miss keys if you are not very careful.3) The four friction studs on the bottom are fixed with an adhesive that runs and oozes even at ambient temperatures of ~ 30 degrees. I have to soak up the runny glue with powder almost on a daily basis.4) Too small for comfortable and fast two-handed typing.
5,"I waited for this particular keyboard for about 6 months to be available in Blue Colour. The price in which I got is 3054/-.. So, I'll judge it by this price (if you can get it in cheaper price, even better).So,,, coming to pros and cons:Pros:1. Very very soothing experience to type on a rounded key. First I thought that I won't even like it that much, but now I love it.2. The key sounds are really quiet. Won't bother your roommate while late night essay writing or when in a library. But the sound of the keys are unique - more like a chicklet sound.3. The support for iOS, MacOS, Windows and Android is great. The dedicated 3 buttons on top lets you switch between three devices instantly (time delay while  switching next is about 3-4 seconds.)4. iOS keys are working flawlessly. Home button, screenshot etc..Now, the CONS:1. The keys are a little bit on harder side, not for touch typing like macbooks.2. Caps lock has no lights. So, you never know when you accidentally pressed Caps lock.3. Problem in connecting with Linux OS - Lubuntu. Couldn't even fix it.4. The left and right arrow keys could have been full size as it has enough space. But they put smaller keys anyway.5. Warranty 1 year only. Logitech usually gives 2-3 years of warranty. But considering it a premium keyboard they should have given 2 years warranty at least.The Cons are not much of a deal breaker. So, if you want it for iPad/Laprop/any other device except Linux, then go fot it. No problems at all."
5,"This is one of the best wireless keyboard out there with the fabulous easy pairing and switching between Windows and Mac devices.This is light weight, small, compact and slim. Just the way i needed my keyboard to be.Its battery operated and hence works with 2 AA batteries which i have not changed in a month since i bought it. So i am assuming it will last for another atleast 4-5 months.It can pair with 3 different devices at the same time and the pairing is just so easy. In my opinion this one is better than K 480 which is heavy and bulky. Not the one for me. The body is made of plastic which is still sturdy and does not feel cheap and flimsy. Obviously you can’t compare it with Apple Keyboard as its aluminium made bu then if you are ready to shell out 10k for it, well go for it. I bought this Logi for 2895 which is a great price keeping in mind the build quality and usage of this keyboard."
3,"Pros:1. Very easy pairing and switching between devices2. Compact, easy to carry and the pink colour looks better in person than in pictures.3. Matte finish.4. Least amount of noise while typing.Cons (According to my personal taste)1. Coming from the 2013 Macbook Air model, the keys are inferior:  a. The feeling of keys is not smooth but rough. Not made with the material which feels good to touch.  b. The Command, Option, Ctrl, Space and Arrow keys are of bumped up shape (concave but protruding outwards) rather than concave having depth like other keys.  c. You have to apply more weight and force to type. They are not soft like that of MacbookAir's.2. Ctrl and Fn keys have replaced positions. Fn (which is useless) is closer to the Option key instead of Ctrl3. NOT a backlit keyboard! (Biggest Con)Conclusion:Overall disappointed. The typing experience is average. Quite lower than the experience you get on older generation macs.Buy if: Looking for a portable, easy wireless keyboard for connecting with any devices.DO NOT Buy If: You are planning to increase the typing experience from your Macs while having the benefits of being wireless."
5,"K380 is an older model from Logitech, but it still handily beats the newer models from this company or its competitors. Couple things that were important considerations for me:—Size: As you know, this is “compact” which means the keyboard is designed to take up as little space as possible. For this reason, I was hesitant while ordering because I didn’t want to be cramped while typing. I have an ancient Logitech full size keyboard (wired), and I wanted the type-feel to be similar with any new wireless one I buy. But guess what, K380 is better: surprisingly, the dimensions of the actual alphabet key console is nearly identical to the full size one. Meaning, all parts of the full size that I almost never use—the side num panel for example—are gone in this one. In other words, it’s “compact” not because they’ve compromised on essential space, but because K380 gets rid of non-essential stuff (as I’m not an accountant or work in a bank, I really need only need a keyboard to write things—so every key I need and use is included: alphabets, top row of num keys & special symbols, no more, no less).—Color: I’d have normally picked a darker shade, but the only color in stock was the rose. I thought twice about this, because the pictures show a somewhat louder shade of rose than I was willing to go for. But in actuality the shade is so subdued that I think I prefer this over the other options, in stock or out of stock.Bonus: the circular shape of the keys reminds me of a vintage typewriter, which I also liked."
5,"One Hell of an experience using LOGITECH KEYBOARD & LOGITECH PEBBLE MOUSE.Turned my IPad 6th Gen 128 gb into a beast LAPTOP lite.Coupled with APPLE PENCIL,the productivity has gone up by a notch.Ideal for students,medicos,bloggers .Touch sensitivity of mouse is brilliant.The keyboard is one of the best I have ever seen or used.& the look and feel is brilliant.I recommend every IPad users to buy these two.10/10"
5,"I don't know if anyone else has got such a keyboard, but The keyboard on the back has a sticker that it has been approved by Pakistan Telecom Authority. I don't know why this keyboard is here in India in that case. I am replacing it and will update if my 2nd keyboard also has the same issue. Does anybody else have this sticker??Update! : I requested a replacement. But the 2nd one unfortunately had scratches so I had to return it. It still had the PTA sticker on back. Maybe Logitech is putting stickers on all devices.Update 2: This is my third purchase from Amazon, and thankfully the keyboard was in perfect sealed condition with no scratches whatsoever. However, the initial sticker (mentioned in photo) was there. I guess they just stick it to all units. So in case you receive a keyboard with such a sticker you can keep the device. So far the keyboard is working great. I can switch seamlessly between my mobile and MacBook for typing. The keys are very comfortable to type on, and very nice. I programmed the brightness up and down using the Logitech Options software. I am loving this keyboard! Thanks Amazon. Also thanks Amazon to the lightening quick refund for my previous unit."
5,"This is an amazing keyboard. I had recently got a 4k Monitor for my Macbook Air 2015. It supports is quite well in the clamshell mode (when the native LCD screen of the macbook air is turned off and only 4k display is being driven via Displayport)... However to work in clamshell mode, we need an external mouse and keyboard. I tried the wired alternatives and the wireless ones with dongles and they take up all the available ports. I cannot connect my audio interface if all USB ports are occupied just for mouse and keyboard. So I decided to get this keyboard and Logotech M557 mouse.This is an amazingly well built mouse. It weighs a respectable 500grams (feels well built from the inside but the outer shell is plastic).Pros:1. The key travel is better than the keyboard on macbook air.2. The keys have stronger feedback and weight to them.3. Keys are almost the same size as the Macbook Air.4. You can wake Macbook Air with this keyboard or the mouse.5. All function shortcuts work perfectly, media buttons, volume, app expose etc.6. There's absolutely no lag in the keystrokes and my typing speed seems to have improved (Attached image). My average speed used to be 75 to 80. With this keyboard, it's gone up above 80. Loving this keyboard and the feedback on key strokes.7. Easy pairing.Cons:1. It could've been a little wider.2. Could've been made of metal (But that's just whishful thinking). For the price of 1600. I believe it's a very good investment in keyboard.3. The arrow keys could've been bigger (but we don't use those as often).4. Caps lock could've had led indicator.5. Missing Home, Pageup, Page down keys (But they're also missing on Macbook air's keyboard)Overall, it's an excellent purchase for 1600. I saw that this was being sold a year or 2 ago for around 1200, I could've bought it then, but even at 1600 I think it's worth the price.Perfect swiss quality from logitech.Update: 24/3/2018My highest achieved speed on this keyboard is 121 wpm. (refer to screenshot). I can't believe that this bluetooth keyboard can compete with some of the best wireless mechanical keyboards out there."
5,"So I bought the Logitech k480 before getting this one.The device was great, rugged, but weighed more and was less portable.I already have a Logitech Pebble mouse so the only logical thing to do was return the device and get K380.I got it today, and so far I really like this keyboard.My purposes to solve are designing, programming, and basic gaming.This device solves all of them and with grace with the added advantage of being portable much.The only hiccup I have so far is getting used to the smol keys.To which I am certain I will get conscious soon.Thanks."
5,"This replaced a 10 years old Apple Wireless Keyboard and the transition has been super smooth and lovely.The keyboard feels very well-weighted - neither too light and not at all heavy. The four non-slip thin bushes at the corners are gripping the table beautifully - the keyboard won’t slide around at all.Next - the typing feel - BEAUTIFUL and butter smooth. Keystrokes are super quiet, like they are damped or something. The key travel is pleasurable and very comfortable. There is enough feedback from the keys and they are not stubborn when pressed nor are they too light or too springy - great calibration. There is a comfortable slant built into the shape of the keyboard without the need for foldable legs.The circular keys are well-sized and spaced. The keys have a very slight inward dip which I believe is contributing heavily to the typing comfort and joy.The major reasons to pick K380 over K480 (older, slightly less expensive) were the smaller size, lesser weight and overall better design for my liking. And also the fact that even though the K480 has the dock/slot to keep tablets or phones, which is indeed a smart feature, most tablets will be used with protective covers which may not fit into that slot and also most covers or cases support magnetic or other “standing” features anyways.Connectivity - easy, straightforward Bluetooth pairing. Can “remember” 3 devices at any given time (can be “connected” to only 1 device at a time though) and can switch between them instantly with the press of the dedicated three coloured keys at the top. The switching is implemented beautifully - takes only 1 second and maybe a few milliseconds to switch between the paired devices. There are tiny indicator lights above the three bluetooth device switching keys which light up for a few seconds when connected to a device and as a nice touch, they go out with a fade-out/theatre dimming effect! Little details.Design - it’s sleek and beautiful. Perfect blend of playful and serious. Dark Grey colour looks very good.It’s almost the same size as the Apple Wireless Keyboard.1 thing to note - when connected to MacBook Pro, you don’t get to adjust screen brightness using the keyboard as those keys are marked for Bluetooth device switching. But you can adjust volume, music controls and mission control from the keyboard just like on Apple keyboard. This is not at all a major issue.The physical on off slide switch is good. Auto sleep/power off feature avoids the need to use the on off switch daily.Overall, thoroughly satisfied and even delighted with the keyboard. Grateful for Logitech to be making excellent products at great value price points.Using an external keyboard and mouse, along with a raised stand for the laptop can VASTLY improve the experience of regularly working on laptops without the need to think of desktops. Best of all worlds."
5,"My initial impressions were that the keys are too small (still getting used to it). But it's a great keyboard. As you keep using, you get used to the new size and shape of the keys. Doesn't take too long to get used to it.I really enjoy using it along with my MX Master mouse. Initially I didn't know there was the option to link a device with the Logitech Flow so I'd keep typing into the wrong screen and send by mistake send messages to random people because I'd be in a hurry to push enter before I realise what I'm doing. So beware if you have multiple computers in front of you. Though linked along with the flow feature of the mouse, it's beautiful. Almost always I know that if my mouse is on one screen, the keyboard is connected there as well.I just wish I could've bought it slightly cheaper and also if I could customise more of the function keys to mimic what the laptop has easily. eg: I haven't been able to find the brightness up/down customisation on Windows (weirdly it's available on the Mac).Despite whatever downsides, I really love my easily accessible and somewhat ergonomic desktop setup with this keyboard."
3,I've been using the product for my everyday work for the post 5-6 months and I consider it an average performer for the below reasons:1. Battery Drainer - There arises a need to replace the batteries every month as it is power heavy. (Use Duracell as it seems to last longer)2. Subject to frequent disconnections - Gets disconnected from pairing eveytime and I have to toggle the power switch everytime to get it paired it with my pc.3. Bad placement of power switch - At times I forget to switch off the keyboard after work (and it drains battery) as the switch is placed on the side and away from my angle of perception.
5,"This is a brilliant keyboard. The build quality, the design are top notch. The size is very comparable to the size of my Dell XPS 15 keyboard, which is a nice thing. The keyboard feels heavy which is again good because while typing the keyboard stays in place - the rubber feet are also soft and grippy which couple with the weight works very well.The typing experience on round keys is bit different. You need to get used to it. I took 2-3days to get comfortable. Once you get comfortable, its a breeze to use.It shifts connectivity to various devices from a tap of a button in under 3 seconds.I bought it for ₹ 2499, otherwise its sold at a premium because its in huge demand. If you are eying for it and is within 3K range, just buy it.Otherwise I was looking at the Thinkpad trackpoint Keyboard II which is even more better, but currently not available in India."
3,"UPDATE: My keyboard started giving trouble just about after one year use. Some keys would print multiple times on screen even with single press... The Bluetooth connection would switch to drive 1 randomly while I am using it connected to device 3.The worst issue that made me give up on this keyboard is when it started muting my computer randomly. With conference calls and videos all day, this was a disaster.I took it to the service center and it wasn't being accepted out of warranty.  For the price paid, I would suggest to buy only if you get 3 year warranty... Otherwise don't fall for the looks and convenience like I did.Also, open the battery compartment and check if the screws are intact... While giving at service center, I was told that the screws were missing. Obviously I didn't open it.. So for whatever mysterious reasons it must have come without those screws. Was it a refurbished one that I was sold as new:0 ????----–---_-------The biggest strength of this model keyboard is its sturdy build and compactness. Sure you can appreciate it for the premium paid but it should serve the purpose of us built for. As a keyboard it is just average... I tend to miss a few key strokes while typing on it. Missing End,Home,PgUp/Down is a disappointment as I realised how important they are only when I started using this keyboard without those keys. Also the keys are a notch small and cramped... Well it's a compact keyboard, what else to expect.Connection to laptop, mobile on Bluetooth is really fast and doesn't miss a stroke.This keyboard is ideal for those who care too much about a good looking keyboard in their desk and have just few typing needs. Like... to type login, forms, search phrases while browsing etc.For those who got to get productive work done with lot of typing etc. Avoid this one. The design is not meant for heavy usage."
5,"PROS:1. Let size not fool you! It's a full fledged keyboard in a very compact layout. Perfect for ipad or android tablet users and people who type on the go.2. There's very little flex and the keyboard is well built.3. It's silent enough to be used inside a quiet library4. You can easily switch between 3 devices.5. The typing experience is satisfying. The round keys are ergonomic and have good travel.CON:1. The keyboard isn't backlit. And at this price point I wouldn't expect the same.MY TAKE: I had the option to choose between the k480 and k380. The k480 is heavier with a cradle to hold the device and it's not very portable. Since i use a foldable cover which can make the ipad stand in landscape mode, I wouldn't need one. So I went for the lighter and sleeker k380. No complaints so far, it's working as expected."
5,"I had doubts in my mind before buying this keyboard but after bought this it is so good that I have bought another keyboard. Here are my pros and cons for this keyboard.PROS:Portable and easy to carryThough it is small in size. It is perfect for typing.Good for programming and typing documents.I use it for approx. 9 hours a day.It can connect up to 3 Bluetooth devices.Seamless connectivity.Low or no noise. It is a silent keyboard like a pebble mouse.Cons:No dedicated home, End Print screen button. If you have used mac laptops then it will not be a problem. You will get used to it. You need to use Fn + Arrow keys for home, end and Fn + tab for screen shot. For windows users you will get used to it in a day.No Fn lock button. You need to use Fn key to use F1 to F12 keys. Esc + Fn will not switch the fn keys lock but it can be remapped using logitech software. The problem is if you are using it in your professional machine then you cant install the 3rd software unless your admin alows it.Other than this it is a very good keyboard for typing and I would recommend it for content creators or programmers or casual typers. This is not the keyboard for gamers ."
5,"Good build quality, minimalist, almost half the weight of K480. Comfortable and ergonomic even for big hands and finger.The only thing weird is the stamp of approval by Pakistan after manufacturing in China."
1,"1. This is Pakistan Telecom Authority spyware.2. Due to bluetooth failure, we may have to type same key multiple time and it's frustrating.3. Bluetooth auto connect is not working."
4,"For low to medium use, and if one of your priority is looks, than there is no better option than k380.I am going to use it as my companion for surface pro whose keyboard stopped working. I am barely going to use it as I don't use surface as primary device.Regarding keyboardBuild guality : 5/5Nice key travel, Matt finish, I hate glossy plastic cheap products so this is very likable.Weight and size: ideal if you are going to use it with Laptop or tablet. I don't like full size keyboard they are bulky and ugly. K380 is nice and small but have some heft so it doesn't wobble while typing.Looks: I had already decided I was going to buy this no matter what because this is one of the best looking keyboard in under 3k. So go for itPrice: I know people have grabbed this in less than 1500, but I couldn't wait for the deal. I purchased in full price of 2900, but still I am fine with that. It's worth the price tag.Verdict : Very nice keyboard for low to medium use. Not for programmes or documents creation regular work."
5,"Works as advertised, easy to use.pros:1. compact design.2. build quality is top-notch, its feels really sturdy.3. keypresses are satisfyingly tactile and key travel is very good.4. for a compact keyboard the ergonomics are surprisingly very good and I didn't have very little mistypes.5. great alternative for a mac keyboard.cons:1. I expected the keyboard to be a bit lighter for its size.2. Doesn't have backlight.3. doesn't have indicators for caps lock other buttons."
5,"This keyboard is super small and compact. This does not take up much space on your work desk and can be easily carried at anyplace you go.The Connectivity is super easy and quick. You just need to setup devices once and you are good to go. There is button to turn it ON/OFF making it easy to save battery.The color , buttons and aesthetics of the keyboard is very chic and gives a fresh look to the keyboard.It might not be suited for people looking for ergonomic comfort.Overall I am in love with this compact keyboard. It gives a good vibe to my current work from home setup."
5,"Logitech K380 is one of the best wireless keyboards that I have used. Very ergonomic, light weight, compact and portable. It has a very slim profile and is very easy to carry if required to be carried in backpack or carry bag. It has multi device connectivity and can be connected with upto 3 different devices at the same time. I have made an unboxing video of this keyboard on my youtube channel - Unbox Daily Tech. You can perfectly pair this keyboard with the Logitech M337 mouse to make it an amazing set as the colour combination matches exactly.Go for it without any doubts. Best part is it works across devices with different platforms like Windows, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android phones etc. It also gets detected as an apple keyboard and apple mouse on Macs which is really amazing."
4,"Given the current scenario, I have started using my old desktop a lot more for WFH than I used to.The keyboard it had was an ageing K480 which was proving to be a little unergonomic and they keys had started to get a little bit sticky.Having heard a lot about how mechanical keyboard are suposed to the next best thing after sliced bread, i decided to get a HP mechanical with blue switches.As nice as the tactile feel of the mechanical was, I soon realized it was not for me as I would make one too many typos while using it.This keyboard was rated as one of the best picks by rtings and wirecutter - I took a gamble on it expecting it to be very similar to the K480.Was I wrong and how - this thing is a lot smaller and lighter.More importantly , the keys have a much nicer short throw and feel - and while it may not feel as nice to type on vs the HP mechanical, my typing speed and accuracy are far better on this..If you do not need a number pad and would prefer a small KB, don't look any further"
2,"The first impression on seeing the keyboard is that it is tiny. It is barely bigger than my palm. That means uncomfortable typing with all keys very close to each other. I pride myself to never look at the keyboard while typing. But with this keyboard, I had to keep looking at the keys often, and make too many typos if I don't read what I am typing. This is coming from someone whose typing speed is >90 wpm for more than a decade.Keeping aside the size, bluetooth too seem to have issues. I am using this with my mac. Whenever the connection is disconnected, typically when my macbook goes to sleep, I had to manually go to the bluetooth settings on my macbook to reconnect. It rarely reconnects on its own. So much for giving dedicated buttons for connecting automatically.Coming to the pros, this looks cute with its tiny size, and is also super portable. Some people might prefer that aspect.I am not sure what the supposed usecase for this keyboard is, but if you are looking at it as a dedicated keyboard while working, this is a poor choice. Go for something bigger."
5,"This keyboard is really great when it comes to portability and multi-device support. The keys are good and the build quality is also amazing. This is a great product for those looking to have a complete wireless setup. Battery life is also great as is the case with most logitech keyboards and mouse. You can literally leave it always on and still have lot of batery left. Comes with 2 AAA batteries which is good. The Rose gold colour is close to the color of the iPAD hence it matches my overall theme too.......Really happy with the product.......Nothing like this in this price range.PROS - Great connectivity for multiple devices - Connects like magic and switches between my iPAD and windows laptop - Able to connect keyboard mouse and headphone all together with my laptop or iPAD so this helps in having a complete wireless setup for eveything. (I also didnt' think it might work. but it worked) - Really slim and quite keypresses no tatcial sound. key travel is little less than average windows laptop but better than any macbook 😋CONS - not that great for ergonomics, specially it has no adjustable tilt. hence you only get one typing angle. tho you can easily make some adjusts on your own to get an angle of choice."
2,"I am not gonna right lengthy review but must say ,Well, keyboard is pretty Nice in terms of look and feel , portability and of-course compact. People who are gonna buy , they will know that know nums key are there so no negative review on it.The only Cons i see that with the spacebar which is that you gotta press almost in middle to put the space bar, which may quite annoying specially when you are programming are typing very fast.and yes Battery is no where gonna last for 2 years as I am using is since last 7days and its already 95 %. I do have  Logitech M590 having single aa battery but It is still at 100% though i am using sincelast 2 month which is awesome.P.S : I dont see no wireless/bluetooth keyboard in the world that has RGB back-light : D , so no negative review for the sameUpdate: This keyboard really has space issue, do not recommend for pragrammer or for heavy use."
5,"I bought this product a few weeks back. I was looking for a wireless keypad with dimensions similar to the laptop keypad and with keys as light and responsive as the ones you get on high-end laptops. I've absolutely satisfied with the product and it meeting my expectations. In terms of weight, it is slightly heavier as compared to the plastic keypads from other brands, but I don't mind it since I use it for home office purposes and not for travel. The build quality is absolutely top-class, key-travel is very less and the round-shaped keys are gorgeous to look at and easy to use. For anybody looking at wireless key-pad to unclutter the desk, I would highly recommend this product. This product is slightly expensive as compared to cheaper plastic ones available in the market, but the quality difference is immense and covers the differential cost."
5,"Value for moneyFound better than expectedBeautiful premium lookYou will not be disappointed.I use it with my laptop, ipad, iPhone, and android phone. Works well with all devices.3 devices at a time are connected and can switch between three with just one key press."
5,"Till now I was using Targus KB55. While that wasn't bad, off late the keys in Targus have been going a bit soft and sometimes unresponsive. Didn't want to shell out huge bucks for magic keyboard. Decided to give this one a shot and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. The slim layout, key response/travel, connectivity, and customizations is amazing. If you're looking for a budget mac keyboard, this is it!"
5,"It appears like a vintage type writer with circular keys. The key stroke is also comparatively harder than laptop keyboards. It is really handy, small, fits into a small laptop bag. Coming to the function, the 3 device Bluetooth connection feature is awesome. A special mention, it has shortcut keys for android and apple, which includes, home button undo, screenshot, and many more. I am really enjoying this keyboard and hats-off to the Logitech's logical idea.However, I started using it yesterday only. I will update my review within an year with any cons if I find. Happy multi-tasking!!!"
5,"It is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. The weight gives you the feel and understanding of the build quality. Excellent with using multiple devices at once. You can switch from Devise 1 to 2 in just one click of a button.The typing experience is premium. As it is a compact keyboard (60%) it is not designed to be ergonomically effective, but it is not bad as well in that aspect.One of the highlighting aspects of this keyboard is, how small this is. Having so much functionality and being so small in size is really fascinating.Being 60% keyboard, it does an excellent job in having all the function keys which you might need. I have used it on my Windows PC, Android and iPhone as well. It has worked wonders on all three devices.Highly recommended product."
5,"I was a little skeptical about the circular buttons and also the compatibility with my MacBook Pro. Now, I feel far more comfortable with this keyboard than the MacBook's butterfly keyboard! In fact, I don't think I would be going back to a keyboard with squared keys. There was absolutely no setup or keymap changing required; I use this in the same way as a normal Apple keyboard.The first three function keys makes it so easy to switch between my iPhone, MacBook and Android TV. Though it is too early for me to tell, all the reviews I've seen on YouTube confirmed that the battery life is well over two years. As for the sound, all keys are far quieter than a normal keyboard, except for the spacebar which is slightly louder. By all means I am happy I went for this over an Apple Magic Keyboard."
5,"This is a great device. The feel, the key travel, the portability and ease to use and connect. its just an flawless experience. No doubt its bit pricy but that what you have to pay for an quality product. Its sleek small and fits in any where. It looks bigger in picture . but actually its too portable and comfortable to carry anywhere and use.I am writing this review using the same. I received it today. If any glitches I will update the post.But for now I am experiencing an awesome typing experience. If you are in market looking for an Bluetooth keyboard just go for it. Nothing can get better than this."
2,"I bought this product after being disappointed by the K840 which had connectivity issues with my Mac Book Air 2020 model.Initially, the product connected quickly and was working well. I used it along with the apple mouse and it still did not have issues.Issues started arising when I connected my laptop to another screen using the USB C Hub. The keyboard got disconnected and has never worked properly when I connect a secondary screen to my macbook air.As soon as I connected my airpods to the Mac, the keyboard went crazy and started typing things on its own and since then I haven't been able to use the keyboard. It doesn't pair with my mac unless I restart the mac.The return time window passed since i recently purchased a new set of airpods and now I am stuck with a keyboard that goes bonkers if connected to the laptop. Very disappointed with the purchase. I wish there can be any resolution to this.As of now, i am back to using a wired keyboard that works perfectly with the airpods connected and the secondary display. There are too many wires on my desk. :("
5,"While a bluetooth keyboard is primarily used for its wireless capabilities, which this works fine for. The weight is a little too much for portability.The keystone is superbly refined and silent. I love typing on this keyboard and now prefer it over the Mac original keyboard.Good for its price as well. Happy with the buy."
5,I have worked for 2 days on the keyboard and writing this review.I have connected with lenovo smart tab and apple ipad both. The switch between the two devices are smooth and faulent.Device is compact and can be placed parallel to laptop or other keyboard on the desk if you are working with multiple devices.Built quality is fantastic and the keys are big and easy to type. Basic functionality are provided with dedicated buttons for easy manhover.I would have been good if height adjustable functionality could have been incorporated.
5,"I've been waiting for the price of this keyboard to fall for over a year. Finally, it fell and bought it.This is a Bluetooth keyboard which is meant for people who use more than 1 device. I use a regular Windows Desktop & an iMac. Having 2 keyboards on my desk was really frustrating.The setup took barely 2 minutes on both my computers. Switching works as expected and is extremely fast.The build quality of the keyboard is far better than I thought. The key travel is nice and the different shape will take a little getting used to.Overall fantastic product and I highly recommend it."
3,"This is a normal membrane keyboard with unusual raised and tiered keys, a bit like typewrite, but keys are not raised high like on a type writer.It is written on the carton of the keyboard that it is ""inspired by mechanical keyboard"". The part of heaviness is caused by the metal plate put on the top of membrane inside the keyboard. There is also the weight of the palm rest.I bought just because it looks different.The rows of the keys are arranged just like seat arrangement in cinema hall. The function keys are raised highest, followed by number keys, and then the first row, second row and third row of letters. The third row of letters and the last row of spacebar is about equal. Under spacebar button, there are 2 springs that are visible. There are no tamper-evident stickers on the top of any of screws under the keyboard. There are 8 screws on portion of the main keyboard, and 4 screws on the palm rest portion. Now think about some cheap keyboards that are littered with many small screws.Palm rest is detachable. However you must be careful in removing it. First remove the screws for easy detachment of the palm rest. I disassembled the keyboard for review purpose. However I strongly recommend you not to disassemble. After disassembling and re-assembling, keyboard was not working properly and I had to spend 3 hours assembling the keyboard several times to make it work.Build quality is undoubtedly tough. But I haven't felt particularly comfortable using this keyboard compared to the Rs 250 Amkette keyboard that I had earlier. However it is good for long hours of typing because of the spacious palm rest.If you want to use multimedia keys, use them with FN key. There is no rupee symbol key."
5,"This isn't a mechanical keyboard. Rather, it gives you a feel like mechanical one.If you are in a dilemma to choose between these and TVS Gold, here are some of the things you may need to consider.• The backspace key in this keyboard is wide, whereas in the case of TVS one it is the same size as that of other keys.• There are media functions that you can use in this keyboard with the help of dedicated ""Fn"" key.• This keyboard has wrist rest pad which is removable if you are tricky enough. But TVS keyboard doesn't come with rest pad. As a two finger typer and also due to lack of space in my desks keyboard holder, I removed the rest pad.• Both keyboards have uplifted keys to feel the typing feedback.• TVS Gold is mechanical whereas this feels like mechanical. The mechanical keyboards are definitely durable. But does it mean this is less durable? Not at all. It seems very durable.• This sounds less loud than TVS Gold keyboard.At a half price of TVS Gold keyboard, this is a keyboard to buy."
5,"The keyboard is good for this price. Thanks to Amazon, for the on time delivery. But there was no cardboard packaging. Only the keyboard box was wrapped up with a tape and it was shipped. Now coming to the product, it is superb. The price is reasonable and the quality is good. Without using the back lights, you cannot see the letters or number printed on the keyboard. It offers good comfort while gaming. When you pressed the keys, you can hear the sounds. Build quality is also good."
5,"Pros:1. It feels great to type on this keyboard2. Typing speed is significantly faster compared to other cheaper keyboards3. Love the palm test, very helpfulCons:Paint on keys fade after few days and this is true. If you want to keep you keyboard safe keep reading.I read few reviews which said the paint will fade eventually, so I coated all the keys with a very thin layer of transparent nail polish after two days of purchase. I have attached the image you can zoom in and see the nail polish there.Tip: wipe your keyboard with a clean clothes before applying, also apply a very thin layer, if you make it thick then the paint will look dull.After coating a layer of nail polish dry it for a few hrs before using it.There you go! No worries now!Cheers!"
5,Awesome Keyboard. Got for just 849/-. Though not RGB but can't expect more in that Price. Go for it.
1,"Bought in July 2018. Looks good, feels good while typing but keys bounce back in a too sensitive way that almost every keystroke is repeated and I get double letters causing spelling mistakes all over a page. I had to spend double the time it takes for typing for just correcting the double keystrokes. I have used the good mechanical TVS keyboards till now but it died on me and I bought this stupid thing. There seems no way to turn off this thing touted as ""anti-ghosting"".Maybe it is good in gaming, but bad for typing in MS Word. At first I thought it was due to my habit of typing on TVS, and I would get used to this new keyboard. But even after two months it is the same story. And the noise it makes when typing at some speed is too distracting! It is different kind of sound, not tapping sound of a mechanical keyboard, but some friction kind annoying noise. Throwing this thing away and buying the good reliable TVS again. (PS: this review typed on a borrowed cheap membrane keyboard)"
3,"PROS:1. liked the simplistic design with no frills or RGB led.2. packing is decent3. raised keys similar to mechanical keyboard4. decent palm rest5. less flex2.CONS:1. the pal rest is not cushioned2. bit on the bulky and heavy side to my liking3. please do not compare the keypress or sound mechanical (it is not)Verdict: decent wired keyboard, worth to try."
5,"So when I bought this, I thought that it would be hard to use it because it was a very high profile keyboard(long-distance travel of keys) and I was only used to the laptop keyboards which were low profile(short distance travel of keys). And then I quickly went to a type test website and realized that I got a much better score with the keyboard than the laptop keyboard that I had been using for almost a year! So if you feel that you won't feel comfortable with the high-profile keys, don't worry this is crazy good.When it comes to build quality, It is very good! And it's very sturdy!So I definitely recommend this keyboard even if you're not used to high profile keyboardsHope you found me helpful!"
5,"Best Mechanical Gaming keyboard under 2000. Keys are very nice and provides a clicky feel. It is ergonomic. Comimg to LEDs, the lights are very bright and the different modes are also stunning. And I personally loved the custom LED mode. The arm rest is just awesom,  and I personally like it very much....If I talk about its cons then I must say that the lights are not RGB as mentioned in the add. But they are just normal LEDs, different colour in different rows which, more or less, provides a RGB look...Still I must say it is great as I am quite satisfied with it...Go for it..."
3,"The finish and build quality are on point for the price. The cable is of decent quality too. Overall look is quite attractive, and for a secondary keyboard all seems well.Unfortunately the key spacing is not comfortable at all. The keycaps are way too small, raised too high, and spaced too closely together for any modicum of comfort. It feels cramped and fingers start aching after just ten minutes of using the right-hand side of the keyboard (arrow + Ctrl/Shift/Enter). Haven't tried WASD but am pretty sure it's worse because there's even less space.It might be fine for kids and the tiny hands of Chinese folks (who it was originally designed for), but for anyone of a normal adult build of over 5' 6"", this is not going to be comfortable at all. Would advise getting a regular keyboard from Dell or Logitech which have much better ergonomics."
4,the keyboard replicates a cherry mx blue key with its clicking noise and tactile bump etc. its a very good full sized mechanical keyboard but the rgb is a bit lacking. the effects look really nice though. if youre hard pressed on spending over 6000 on a keyboard buy this one
1,This is a waste of ₹850. You can buy a cheaper more durable mechanical keyboard instead. Several keys have stopped working within 2 days of purchase. They sometimes work with a lot of tilting and adjusting the cable. Absolutely useless product. My advice is to buy something else.
2,I bought this in October 2020 at rate of 1.9k. Firstly the packaging was not good. There were bents and folding on each corner.The keyboard does not come with the the hand rest attached. You have to attach on your own which is risky.The keyboard is fine. But it is very loud and a bit irritating with the feed back. The print on keys are already 20 percent faded.I would strongly recommend you to buy livetech kb03 model which is amazing and way better than this model kb08.The only feature at which kb08 is better is that it has rgb backlight. Where as kb03 doesn't have backlight.In every other way kb03 is better than kb08.
2,"I bought this Kb08 exactly a year back, and now, lot of keys are malfunctioning. Going through the comments looks like the life of the keyboard is 1 year only, which is exactly the case with me. As it took around 2K, I expected this will work for at least 2 years.The keyboard was good while it lasted, very ergonomic and decent for gaming. But price of 2K/- with just 1 yr  longevity if very low value for money. I cannot suggest this to anyone. Better pay more and go for better products."
3,The keyboard looks sturdy and durable. The hinges/contacts of the palm rest  were found to be broken on arrival. There is no scroll lock light available on the keyboard. The quality should have been bit better for the price tag.
5,"Best at the price point,just one problem without led backlight hard to see key alfabates but it's not big issue ,I got it under 1500 thanks Amazon,it's sturdy,keys blue type not cherry MX blue but no lag at all ,wire is strong,it looks like premium product,I think it will last longer!"
5,"Just got this product (15th August 2019). The keyboard is good as per price. I bought it for Rs 959/-. The wire of keyboard is not typical one that we usually see in keyboards. It is nylon strand wire so, I am not sure how reliable the wire is. Wire has Velcro to bind, just like we see in laptop chargers . I suggest you to tie the wire with one of the whole of the keyboard to avoid any kind of tension at joint.Pros:- Looks premium- Easy to clean- Though it does not have mechanical keys, however feels like mechanical (except the click sound)- Plastic quality is good.Cons:- It has LED for Caps Lock and Num Lock only. No Scroll Lock LED. If seller is reading this feedback, please mention this in description. I replaced this product once just because of this reason. But, the keyboard which I got in replacement also has the same problem. So, I believe it does not come with Scroll Lock LED. (You can see in image)- If you are not aware about the position of keys, it is going to be hard for you to find the right keys in dark room. Because, light does not pass through the keys.I am giving this feedback after using it for one day only. Though, I am not sure about the longevity, but still it feel good to work on this keyboard."
3,"So I'll preface by saying this this is fairly a budget option, and you're supposed to expect these kind of thingsBut the seller is kinda shady, the product I recieved was clearly opened previously, looking at the way the wire was left in untangled.Upon closer inspection my W key wasn't bouncing back up. I see that the rubber that's supposed to make it retract is broken.Well I didn't have enough time to replace and return so I used a spare keyboard and transplanted it's rubber mechanism to this one, and it seems to work fine.But this is not done.The keyboard is good, heavy metal plate, nice smooth long travel keys, spaced properly."
3,pros:1. good looking. unique looking. metal finishing is good2. gives a mechanical keyboard feelcons:1. the letters printed on keys are off extremely bad quality. i think within few months it will fall off. looks cheap.2. it needs support stands in back so keyboard so it can stand diagonally.3. cable is quite short. needs to be longer.4. it's not a mechanical keyboard
5,I received this keyboard with somewhat bad condition..there was one button who's mechanical switch was not functioning...plus the box was damaged from outside as well..so I placed a replacement..I received a perfect working keyboard.so many options for the RGB..loving it..its the best recommendation for this price rate
1,"Don't by this product Because after 1 month SHIFT Key not working other keys also not working. So don't buy this product. Looks so Good, Color is too Good but keys will be not working properly. so if possible it will be replace or refund so please help me out. because this is not about money this is about product I bought in 1830/- INR. so this is waste of money. and this is not Value for money Product this is my personal experience. I Would like to suggest you guys you can by other brand Keyboards. Don't by this."
5,Really good for me and pretty good for the price and really feel like a mechanical keyboard but sound is not great but acceptable for this price the built is pretty sturdy and overall a great keyboard for gaming and typing and I was shocked when I opened my package it was a big upgrade from my last keyboard and it is pretty heavy btw the elevation clips don't make a difference to me this keyboard looks like a mechanical keyboardAnd they should have included a wrist rest I give it a 7 in comfort and make sure to buy a wrist rest with this keyboard
5,The product totally satisfied me..and i love the clicky loud blue switch sound that it emits
3,Are you a programmer or touch typer? Take a closer look at the positions of pipe key (UNIX pipe) or the backward slash key (directory seperator in Windows). In this keyboard they are adjacent to ENTER key. Usually they lay above ENTER key. That minor blip might not hit every one and keyboard is very good apart from that. So decide for yourself.
4,"Received the product today [on time]RGB lighting looks beautiful.Compatible with any PC/Laptop.Little bit noisy compared to RED-GEAR BLAZE.Keys feel Slippery as Its a New Product.Key Tick sound feels noisy.Braided Cable With Gold Color Coated USB.Separate Palm Rest is Provided in box. [Feels difficult while installing and removing]Metallic Spring Sound while pressing the SPACE BAR4 Stars due to No Amazon Packaging Was Provided By Seller. [No Seal Was Given on The Box, Anyone Could Have Opened it Easily On the Way]"
1,Received today on time
4,"The Live tech Keyboard KB08 is quite good, i like most is the lighting system with different light mode . And the reason why i gave 4 stars is the packaging is so bad that if your not lucky enought it might be damage during shipping."
4,"The keyboard is sturdy and responsive. Keys are well lifted to give feel of mechanical keyboard. Palm rest is good add-on at this price point. But the colours of alphabet started to fade away after Just a week of use that's the only disappointing thing. Letters will fadeaway after a month, so think this before buying."
1,they send defective & replaced keyboard. i could clearly see the original packaging was removed & resealed. i was thinking that this might be a defective one & someone has replaced it.very disappointed.
2,"Got a faulty keyboard when I bought it the first time,the backlight on one of the rows was not working properly,got it replaced.After using for a month,one of the keys (q key) stopped working properly and some keys typed twice even though pressed once (e key being one of those keys).Really expected much better for the price range.My last keyboard was a 500rs normal Logitech keyboard that lasted me 3 years.Would be much better if they actually concentrate on the performance rather than making the product look fancy."
5,The quality of plastic is very nice.. it is hard plastic and not that cheap one  I would definitely recommend this if you want quality and yes this is not a mechanical keyboard but a membrane keyboard.... Built quality is decent
5,If your looking for a budget mechanical Keyboard this is the best you can find. The effects are Dope. Clicky sound. Good response. Been using it for over a month Gaming daily for 2-3 hours. Takes times to get used to it ur switching from a normal keyboard to a mechanical one.
4,"One of the best keyboard I haves used so far.a good design and is much comfortable to use.the keys are a but raised, feels like a type writer. For gaming its great.Only 4 stars because of the worst seller(Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore).Received the product broken.The extra attachments for palm rest is broken.Dear Amazon ,please take necessary actions and dont disappoint your future customers due to the sellers."
4,For value for money this is little costly ...but ergonomics and typing comfort is good ..it could be more 250 rs cheaper as per local market pricing ..Anyways good attempt
3,"The keys are decent and the feel is good. This isn't an rgb keyboard. I've been using it for 8 months now and already, two of the keys have started to exhibit no response. I would suggest going for a more durable gaming keyboard and spend a little extra for longer usability."
1,no long lifelong process of warranty claimCheap services..Not satisfactoryDurability. ( zero)
5,"Pretty good when compare with other membrane keyboards, light glowing is fentastic, keys are very sharp and feel like Mechanical keyboard. Recommended product"
4,My Live Tech Vulcan Mouse doesn't let me down for the past 2 years and counting.....I hope KB03 PRO deosn't let me down.as mentioned before.....for gaming it's good but for occasional typing it will do
5,I didn't expect the keyboard to be this good. At a price of Rs 1900 this offers the biggest bang for my buck.The only con i see till now is that the right arrow key is a little loose and comes out easily.
5,Pros1.Raised keys2. Anti ghosting keys means these 19 keys registration never Mises.3. Nice look and looks like 2000rsCons1. Little bit heavy2. Last model comes with palm rest .

2,This keyboard not a good quality. In my case after 3 months keyboard is not working properly and I am very thankful for cosmic byte team. I am call the customer service of Amazon and they are give me a contact number of cosmic byte team. I am calling them to ask if my problem with this keyboard. The customer service is very good. Customer service will return this keyboard and they said it was faulty ic or circuit them afterthe 15 days he is replaced the keyboard but the in my case this keyboard is not available in India. I am change the keyboard to another keyboard for cosmic byte the model no is CB-GK 03 Black Eye to cut my old keyboard price and after paying amount to pay on the delivery. I have 2 star of the keyboard but I'm give it 5 Star for cosmic byte service center team. Good work.
5,"I'm using the keyboard since near 2 months . I'm running on windows 10 . The picture i uploaded is in the broad day light . so , i hope the people who's gonna purchase this keyboard does't have to worry about in the night time . The working conditions of my key board are , when it's not using the back light turn's off , when the system is in snooze or paused in gaming time's key board blinks and light's are stable while using . These are the things i felt using the product.  Now i'm only looking forward to the durability of the key board. I paid 812 Rs/- for this product. Comparatively cheaper with the competitor's in the market also. :-)"
2,"I liked the RGB effect when it worked that is, which it didn't half the time as the lights kept turning off for hours. Very unreliable product received. The front panel was damaged and numpad delete key was missing the membrane support. Otherwise the keys are nice and soft. Its a good cheap rgb keyboard if everything worked. But I won't recommend buying this at all."
1,"This keyboard advertises 19 anti ghosting keys but it is just sweet talk to point towards the fact that not ALL keys work.For all you gamers out there, please note that that this keyboard will not register the W,Q and A keys together. Which basically means that you will NOT BE ABLE TO PEEK WHILE MOVING DIAGONALLY. Similarly, W, E and D will not be registered together. For a keyboard which advertises itself as a gaming keyboard with N-key rollover, this was a HUGE disappointment. Suggest you to spend a little more money and go for actual well-known vendors because cosmic-byte is only here to fool you all."
4,"I did not buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a programmer and I have to write thousands of lines of codes at a go. Previously, I used the keypad of my laptop for typing but I wasn't feeling comfortable using the inbuilt keypad because I could not type very fast on the laptop as I always had a fear of jamming any key of the keypad. And you may know that replacing a laptop's keypad is very expensive. Hence, I decided to buy an external keyboard. While buying the keyboard, I considered mainly three points which were 1) the keyboard must have back-lit keys so that i can type in the night without turning the room lights on and disturbing others sleep,  2) the keyboard needed to be sturdy and 3) it must have adjustable height. At first, I decided to consider keyboards from reputed brands like Logitech but I realized that they were extremely expensive and would be an overkill for my needs. After that I came to know about this keyboard from CosmicByte. It had all the features which I had been looking for and luckily it wasn't expensive at all ! That's why I purchased this keyboard from Amazon at about 1.2k and after using it for some days, I must say it is quite good. I am listing down the pros and drawbacks of this keyboard below,> Pros1. It has 7 different LED colours and nine different modes ! You can even adjust the brightness of the LEDs and customize the illumination pattern. The LEDs are very bright and I can assure you that even reputed and expensive brands like HyperX, Corsair, Kingston do not have higher brightness than this one. Clearly, LED back-lighting is its biggest plus point.2. The height of the keyboard is adjustable and that's a good thing. It has four rubber pads on its back side to keep it firmly fixed on its place.3. The keys are scratch resistant.4. The cable is braided and super sturdy hence no chance of getting torn down due to folding.>Now, let's talk about its drawbacks,1. The keys are not that sturdy. It is still okay for typing but I seriously doubt about gaming. Although the keys look like mechanical ones but they aren't. if you are considering this keyboard for gaming then I would suggest you to avoid this.2. No dedicated media playback buttons.So the bottom-line is this is really a great, value for money keyboard if and only if you want super duper LED back lighting effect and comfortable typing for long sessions. However, this isn't a good gaming keyboard as the keys are not that sturdy and I seriously doubt how long it can last with heavy gaming.One last point, although this isn't about this keyboard. This is about packaging from Amazon. Amazon packed the product very poorly. They didn't wrap it with any bubble wrap or air pillows and shipped it directly within a plastic sack ! This type of poor packaging from Amazon is really a bad thing. I hope they improve their shipping standards."
2,"Dont buy if you are a coder/type a lot.It was my experience after one month of 9 hours a day using it.This keyboard is nice looking like a truck in RGB mode.but on reality side you will hate it using in rainbow mode. It irritates while working. I used the static color blue or white while working in dark room.But after 1 month. I am done with it. That rgb thing is just a fancy thing which you will not use until you are recording video or posting instagram snap or some friends are with you in the room to boast it. Else 😶Its waste. Atleast I didnt use RGB ever.Talking about typing experience. I am a professional developer and I have to type a lot. Using this keyboard initially was okay, I tried to adjust myself. But after a month fingers started paining. Keys are hard to press. Membrane keyboard is not made for coders. Go for a mechanical keyboard if you use keyboard to type more than 5 hours a day. Else this keyboard is fine for excel and basic stuff ( gaming too).Cant use it or return it anymore. It will go in cupboard nothing else. 😊 Wasted but learnt a lesson. Will use it maybe in future when mechanical keyboard sound is not required. Thanks for reading"
4,"I got the keyboard replaced with a another brand new one by amazon & seller - thanks for that. Previous keyboard had issue with W & Shift key it was hard to press.Pros:Rgb lightning, with 7 color different color option, various light effects is a +, feels solid while press which is good for gaming, build is tough & not flimsyBetter than redgear keyboards in this budget. Even its the only good option in this budget.Cons:Keys are hard to press & painful while playing for long hours.Hand rest is not there so no place to rest your palm while typing or gaming for long time"
1,"So I bought this product since my previous keyboard was also from cosmic byte and I was pretty comfortable with it. I was very comfortable with this product, the lighting was also pretty and except the space bar, every key was sturdy. However, after 2 months of use the keyboard stopped working randomly. I tried to claim the warranty but they replied by saying that they cant do anything since the product is out of stock and will not be available until the end of September. Fraud for money, 0/10 Customer Service and reliability. Would not recommend this keyboard at any possibility."
5,I was looking for a budget keyboard with RGB backlight to step up my setup and then I came across this product. In my view this keyboard is very close to perfect (for the price).PROS-1.Highly customisable RGB lighting which no other keyboard offers at this price range!2.Good click feeling..even though not mechanical.3.Long braided usb cable.CONS-1.Keyboard should have been working raised at angle to make it more ergonomic.2.The red back looks really cheap!CONCLUSIONI would definitely recommend this keyboard
5,First of all to cosmic byte plese make specific area to get reviews  in Amazon all of keyboards reviews are mixed up..And to you who is reading cb gk 02 corona is a great keyboard with engraved letters and good rgb for price..If you don't have budget to buy more than 1200 then this keyboard is for you.And if you are buying this for traveling plese don't this keyboard could  break under 5-10kg load so take one cheap keyboard which is unbrekble..
5,"The keyboard is certainly good looking and as shown in th images.Pros: Bright lit and readable keys.-Accurate key stroke are registered-I would say when it comes to gaming this is at par with some of the expensive keyboards.- Multi Color LEDs with 9 preset modes- Braided cables which is a only available on premium keyboard. It's a mark of a quality keyboard.Cons: No arm rest which makes it a pain to use this for longer hours.- The Led modes are preset and they cannot be saved so each time you turn on your PC you have to select your previously set mode again.- Prone to collecting lot of dirt as there is log of gap between the keys.But despite the cons I love the keyboard. It's one sturdy keyboard. If you are on a budget, but want to have a premium keyboard experience then go for this one."
3,"My cousin bought this keyboard and i tested his out its RGB colors look very pretty and was convinced to buy it, but when it arrived the box was damaged and when i saw the keyboard, it was opening even though the screws were there, had it replaced and even the replaced version of the keyboard was damaged, this shows how well they handle the package, i'm returning the product as of now, guys if you want to buy this keyboard I recommend to buy it on their website which is cosmic byte, the guys in amazon do not know how to handle the product, this is the first time i've had a bad experience with amazon through may years as being a regular customer."
5,"after a month of use i can say it's just awesome, too good.. key travel is more than my old intex one which is actually good, it is somewhat prone to catching dust under the keys, not too big of a deal since it's fairly easy to clean blowing air or using tweezers or removing the keys.. i would have liked a computer sleep hotkey but no big deal, can still use the windows shortcuts but they are like 4 key presses.. windows+D then alt+f4 then arrow up then enter.. love the lighting and control options.. it doesn't remember the light settings once the computer is turned back on that might be good actually.. takes anywhere from 1 to few keystrokes to get to the desired setting. this is in no way a mechanical keyboard but it's far better than the membrane keyboards we typically use.. sits somewhere in the middle.. spillproof too, there are 3 water drain holes at the bottom, you can see right through them. i didn't have any issues with the key prints fading off yet and it feels like the paint layer is substantial when i touch trying to feel how thick the paint is, quiet thick i would say.. having said all this, it still gets no less than 5 stars from me.. there is no other keyboard even close to the price with backlit rgb and this many lighting options that looks so dam cool.. nothing beats it.. I'd say go for it!"
1,The back lit leds seemed pretty good....Just then my eyes fel in the bottom part of the keyboard...The screw joints were broken... Ya that's right... I egarly waited for this keyboard to be delivered.... But I had nothing but a handfull of disappointment... I don't know who's fault is this is that the courier service or the product was damaged from the first... But I'm very disappointed.... 😑

5,"The most best keyboard in the price range. The build quality is good not the great. And it has 9 lighting RGB effects which is eye-catching. I love this keyboard. And some reviews says that the text is fading after long use that is totally wrong. I am using for 3-4 months and i plays always fps games like pubg , call of duty , counter strike. Etc. In this case i use W A S D SHIFT keys offen in my case it long lasting and the test not faded. The best keyboard under rs1200 and you can go for it.  Now it is currently unavailable in Amazon but you can try in cosmic Byte website. Best buy for my PC upgrade."
4,"I  typed for long time with this and yes I feel real comfort. I don't need press hard which cause hand pain for long time typing. Also the backlit effect helps a lot to work at night at office. At this price plastics quality is not that good, if I press hard at middle sometimes it bends. Also the shape of enter key little bit troubling me but as a whole worth buying it."
4,"I bought the red variant for 1139₹ on 12.08.2020.First impressions :Built quality:Average, but not a concern for most of them. There is little to no flex while typing. Back red casing looks cheap, but rest are OK. Keys print quality also seems ok, but the plastic keys feel cheap compared to my previous logitech keyboard priced around 1000₹.Gaming:Played pubg for 1hr, no ghosting issues found, also responsive. Lighting is good and keys also get lit up. Only 2 color modes for the single colour variant: normal and breathing.Productivity and general usage :Here is where this keyboard falls behind. Since it is marketed as a gaming keyboard, it's OK but the typing experience is not that great. You will take some time to get used to it. On my first day of usage, i felt myself making more errors while typing. This all accounts on the key shape and feel. I felt the keys where quite boxy and slippery compared to my old logitech one.Packaging and delivery:This is the worst part. The product packaging was bad and dusty.No date of manufacture printed on the box. Also no serial number printed on the box to identify the product's genuineness. Also the amazon box was torn open and the keyboard box could be seen through when it arrived. Thankfully the keyboard was OK and no minor scratches or defects were found. Disappointed with amazon delivery and seller in this part.This was my first impressions on this keyboard. I felt it is slightly overpriced. Should have been around 800-1000rs.Will update my review after 1 week of extensive usage"
4,"Warnings!!!!!.Cb-gk-08...This keyboard has only rainbow effect only,no other color effects...Brought it on: 29/12/2019Pro:Sturdy buildGood key press( sound not as much as a mechanical but it will do the job)Good rgb brightnessGood packagingBraided cablePrice is low (799)Con:Only rainbow effect(i thought it was full rgb but only Rainbow effect .One key combination swap the aswd keys to arrow keys(haven't found what key combination to undo it)"
4,"this is just an attempt to find out what typing on this thing feels like.The tactile feedback is pretty good, however the end is a bit soft. So it's good-bad.The overall feel of typing is pretty good though.The keys aren't too hard to press, they are spaced well enough.The shape of the enter key is a bit different from what I'm habituated to, but that's not an issue.The backlighting is pretty good. It comes with a direct on-off switch, and has 3 levels of intensity adjustment.Note: this is a blue LED only model. The direct LED on-off key is very handy instead of having to toggle through the settings.The risers on the bottom aren't too tall, so they don't give the keyboard much of an angle.Overall, it's a very good keyboard, but not one particularly aimed at gamers.It's essentially just a normal keyboard with some backlit keys."

3,"The keyboard is good and all, but the keys won't last very long... Its a membrane keyboard, so the keys will get softer as time passes. But after lightly using it for around a month, the keys are already very soft... If you like soft keyboards then you may not face a problem. But for those who like tactile keyboards, just get a mechanical keyboard or get a different membrane keyboard. This keyboard is good for typing, but not good for gaming.."
3,I have used this keyboard for a total of 5 days and my experience went from good to eh.Below I'm mentioning my experienceThe RGB would look great in beginning till you won't habitual to it.The keys become wobbly after heaving usage like typing and gaming and make noise even on light touches.Doesn't have gold plated usb.Has braided cable!The keyboard appears great online but the plastic is weak and keys may stop working if pressed hard enough.The only point of buying it is the RGB keys that's allReturning it

3,Pro:1.Brought form 716 RS2.Only keyboard with decent backlights3. ALPHABET are visible at nights BIG DEAL4. Doesn't gives a cheap look of rgb colour mix5. Good side protection and red light at edges.6. 3 variable brightness adjustmentsCons:1. Single colour2. A bit costlier for single colourOver all better than RGB as pink and green or red are not that good as per my preference  or the combination of those neither breathing lights are useful but just marketing stuntQUITE WORTH !!
3,"Alright I'll be honest. When the delivery guy first delivered it, the package was kind of ""squished"" and dented near the lower left corner (depends on how you see it) but the keyboard box was still in shape so it was only the external packaging. Lucky :v. It kinda looked like they just picked it up from their store room as if it was sitting there since like 3 or 4 months getting all dusted because I could notice the settled dust on the keyboard box. The keyboard works just fine anyway tho it's only been 2 days since I am using it. Tried all the RGB effects and it is just as mentioned in the user manual or description. The Del key on the numeric keypad looks 3% faded just 3% :v. Tho I hope the other keys don't start fading after heavy usage hmmm. That's all for now."
1,"One of the worst keyboards ever. The antighost keys never register properly. Dont ever use it for gaming. When you are using mutliple keys (for a game like fifa), all the keys wont register properly and you can certainly feel the lag. Have to press the keys years before to get the proper move. Only the lights in the keyboard are as advertised. I have used a no. of keyboards (wired and wireless) and even if this is a wired one, it dont have the response of a bluetooth keyboard."
3,"packaging was damaged. But keyboard was ok.Backlit are fine and bright enough.You can control brightness, color and other functions of backlit.Lights also can be reactivate according to sound.But major problem i am facing is that with keystrokes,Back key and some other key r jamming. You need to press back key from center otherwise you will face jamming while you pressing the key.Btw its my 1st rgb keyboard with gaming look.I used to use simple 500rs keyboards.In future will try to use mechanical."
5,"It's a must have keyboard, Love it's various modes & is useful in no-light conditions. Always wanted to have a back-lit keyboard for my laptop; wonderful to program various colours & speeds of lighting."
5,"Bought it 2 days ago and so far I'm impressed with the keyboard. At this price the features are pretty great. The keys are elevated and some of you might take a few days adjusting to it. The anti ghosting feature is also present which is a must if you play games. Regarding the build, so far it appears to be sturdy. I'll update the review in a few months if any issue comes up.P.S.: if it has been a few months since this review was written, there has been no issue at all. (12 July 2020)"
5,"I'm alot happy since I got this product. I won't say this best in this price range cause if you spend nearly 2-3K you've still not close to get this kind of product.Pros.7 Color backlit with effectsYou can select any of color as constant to work on.You can select different rgb patternsin different part of keyboard.The amazing thing is you can set your own color from given 7 in any of keyboard part which is user defined mode provided by this keyboard.Voice control over backlit works more accurate.Functions given with short cut like calc, mail etc.No need of install any driverConsI haven't found any cons but a plastic body and not of aluminium needs more care to be taken since it is obvious in this price range.Go for it. Will worth your single penny."
4,"Best keyboard I have ever used , not recommended for people who want mechanical keys, because it is totally different from mechanical keyboard and membrane keyboards, it gives some different feel while gaming, it's response time is very good, and the brightness of RGB is good not very much bright. It has voice detection RGB mode which is a good feature in this keyboard which is present in ₹3000 and above keyboard. I only recommend thes IF YOU HAVE LOW BUDGET FOR BUYING KEYBOARD (BELOW ₹ 1500) otherwise u can buy cb-gk-12 which is little bit expensive but it is worthy 🤗🤗"
5,"The reason I bought this was for programming and gaming. This has sufficed my expectations. RGB isn't one of the best features of the keyboard. But let's face it, the only time it is used is when you take a picture or to show-off to people. Otherwise, personally, it is more of a disturbance rather than an interesting feature of the keyboard. But you can always turn it off. So that's a win-win.The overall key handling, typing experience, mechanical feel, gaming experience, sensitivity is so damn perfect for the price especially. Got it for 700 bucks. It is really a good purchase if your budget is low and you are not looking into using it that heavily. Once you get the hang of it, you will stick to it. Go for it then?"
5,Good product considering the price. Gives a mechanical feel when you type on it. In my opion an average user can also buy it. Not sure about gaming cause I am not that much into gaming. Overall a good package.I got it around 700 rupees. If you are getting it in that price point then it's a steal....The only con that I have is that you can't change the colors....which is annoying sometime....also I feel the default brightness is too harsh..... Although you can change the brightness levels...
3,using this keyboard for almost 1 year. my use is heavy and for gaming only. the keyboard is of good quality but the lettering on some buttons are faded after 1 year of use. I had some issue within 6 months of use. some keys were stopped working so I gave it to repair to cosmic byte repair center under warranty. service was good and fast. they did something I don't know what but it's ok now. so service is good. its good product but not perfect its good for its cost.update : used this for 1 year and 4 months of regular heavy gaming use and its dead now. some keys are not working. and base broke in half all attached screws are broke. quality issue.
4,"Been using this keyboard for a while now and I have not faced any issues with this for now.However, The only thing annoys me is that the the flippable stand on back of the keyboard does not stay in place. so you have to adjust it every time to lift the keyboard a little up or down.Apart from this go for this"
5,Best keyboard in this budget... There are more expensive keyboard than this keyboard.. But this one is a lot better than them... Key pressing feedback is awesome.. Customizable light.. 9 types of default lighting effect... Build quality is also very good and strong..
4,"its is not the old version,its the new version of keyboard,and doesnot have the lightning features like it used to have in older ones.Overall agood keyboard for normal usage and can do casual gaming's  not hardcore. Also membrane keyboard cant give u the feel of mechanical keyboard,but gets the work done.It look nice at night and also keys can be removed and cleaned.I dont prefer it to be take along when u travel.keyboard has 3 zone lightning, but no extra effects with brightness controls, plastic body so not very rigid,to be true it doesnt feel like premium, got it for 900 rupees so no complain u cant expect much more in this price range,pretty much job done,decent look at night,bought it cause cosmic byte service is good,,hope it works fine with me also.braided cable is present.Dont get confused like me its a new version,older version used to have fancy lightning with effects.working for me for almost 1 and half month....hopefully last longer."
5,"SURPRISE MF says the keyboard when you open it cause this one screams quality!I have been using the Corsair k95 rgb with cherry mx red for about 18months, and i had some issues with the leds, its gone for an exchange, now i thoughg lets try these cheap options by the time it returns, n see whats the diff bet a 16k and a 4k keyboard offering supposedly, the same features. so heres my list of whats there and what u r missing on by not buying an expensive alternative:1. The mechanical BLUE switches are really good with nice feedback, they are not cherry but are good quality none the less.2. The build quality is good, yes it is. 4k for such a build is great. Metalplate board with plastic sorrounding is same as a CM storm mechanical board.3. RGB Elements are great, inbuilt themes are nyc and you can download the siftware as well to customize.4.Macros are somewhat available u can customize from the software availble from the website mentioned in the manual.Now what u r missing out by not buying a more expensive mech keyboard;1. the keys are a bit wavy at times, can woble( u will not observe this unless u have worked with a corsair keyboard, even razor has same issues with keys)2.No dedicated media keys, u need to press fuction n then f1 f2 and so on for media playback.3. The lack of proper software support, u can customize but u cant save the profiles on the keyboard, so u have to keep the software open for the customization to show on the keyboard and if u close the soft or restart the changes are also gone.I can pinpoint more but honestly this is one really nyc piece of hardware and you wont regret it SPECIALLY IF U R MOVING FROM A MEMBRANE ONE.To all the gamers PLEASE SWITCH TO MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS, U WILL NOT REGRET IT!"
5,"It's been a while since I purchased the product and it's hardly given me any issues so far. Got it for 4k in December, 2017. There was this brief time when one of the keys was mysteriously registering multiple presses, but the issue went away just as randomly as it came. Other than that, I have no complaints about the product."
1,Some keys just stopped working in the middle of a game after 3 months of usage. would not recommend this product at all. cant type much cuz have to use on screen keyboard for many letters.
5,Keys are smooth . Keyboard is very heavy . There is no palm rest .red switch are doing very well in gaming tym sounds are not tooo loud that good for me . Overall it is best keyboard in this price range and this keyboard can beat high range red key keyboard also
5,"Feels great, the keys are responsive and there are plenty of lighting options. Plus you don't have to pay a ridiculous amount for a mechanical keyboard. There is nothing to complain about. Overall, this is a great keyboard for 3200 and I will recommend buying it."
4,"So, I have using this keyboard from last 30 days for casual gmaing and programming I have found this keyboard comparitvely good as a Cherry MX blue switch. The keyboard is heavy and sturdy and brightness of red led is decent also the tactile feedback is amazing and feels pretty good while an dlet me tell you far better than any membrane keyboard. It's a pretty good option for only ₹4199 which according to me is really fair price for this keyboard."
5,"I am not a gamer. But wanted good keyboard for WFH which is not noisy.This keyboard with Red keys is perfect fit for that. It has backlight which helps in dark.So it is mechanical, not noisy and very comfortable for typing."
4,"the product was damage little bit from below, May be beacuse of shipping or any thing else , but i decide to use it anyway,Now its been 2 years or more and still every thing working fine"
5,"Great mechanical keyboard and also reasonably quiet(as compared to red switch keyboard that I use). Very sturdy too. I use this for general programming and IT job and works great. An additional palm rest would've been nice. Overall a great value for money keyboard (purchased for approx Rs.3500).I am not a gamer, but my guess is that this will work well in that area as well if you are on a tight budget."
1,"Keyboard is quite good stready and tactile and quiet cuz of red switches for 2900.The only downside was apprio retailer sent the product in open state with bill inside the box i.e on keyboard (typically the bill is outside), key cap puller is missing.Edit: after replacement, everything is fine."
5,"Am not that much of a gamer. I had tried the blue key type keyboard at a friend's place and loved the clicky, tactile feel while typing. During my brief research, understood the different key variants - blue, brown and red switch keys and felt that the red one would be most suited and to my liking. Got this during the great Indian festival for 2.7k. Very happy for the buy and enjoying typing with it every moment!"
5,"Redgear Mitra K551 RGB and hands down, what an amazing keyboard.People who loves click sound then this is the one to go with under 4k. Blue keys + all keys are individually backlit hence it's is bright enough. Aluminium plate on top.I sit under a led tubelight which is really really bright and I can read all the keys at any angle. Material of the keys are also good, they don't reflect the light like HP K500F etc."
5,"It is the best budget mechanical keyboard having red switches. It comes with extra red switches, key cap puller, switch puller. Don't get confused by other comments and reviews."
4,"PLEASE SEE THE UPLOADED IMAGES. Tried my best to make sure the highlight some key-points. This is a GREAT Keyboard for its Price Point (3-4k INR segment) but has 1 major flaw that is really disappointing for gaming usage : Since this keyboard uses RED Switches (or equivalent clones of Cherry MX Red), there is no Tactility in the keystrokes. It has a very short Actuation point (feels like almost at 1/3rd). Combined with both these points, this is a NIGHTMARE keyboard if you have habit of resting your fingers on the keys. Even after a solid week of usage I have not gotten used to this (and am afraid this might become a permanent pain point), so have faced multiple times every hour that my character will suddenly start moving left (A on WASD layout) and I will be caught off guard only to then realize what has happened, but by then it is too late.Once again, this is a GREAT Keyboard, but RED switches could be a deal-breaker for many unaware folks."
4,"Finding red switches at this price point is tough but this has legit Outemu red switches which can be better than even cherry MX. If you are not used to mechanical keyboards it will take u a day to get used to get, but eventually you will get the hang of it and start loving it. O played Valorant, Minecraft and Fortnite on this, no problem at all. Just make sure to clean the dust once in a while ."
1,"One of the worst investment that I have made in a keyboard,the product looks to be good on review but,the product are not as expected and I received a defective one, customer service by origin Redragon is aslo extremely horrible and impolite ,they don't want to take responsibility for their manufacturing defects and they will blame you for certain reasons,think twice before buying this kind of expensive keyboard with a bad customer and servicing center"
4,"If you are gamer or programmer. Then go for it. The metallic and rigid body structure provides durability. It's heavy weight than other keyboards. (Man, if you hit someone's face, it might hurt.. don't try this at home).. the key pressing interrupts (signals) are sensitive but at the same time they are hard as well. No matter with what speed or how much pressure you're gonna press it. The RGB lighting and patterns are impressive. But the brightness is very low. Even at highest brightness settings it feels less bright. It's a worth for money.."
4,"So, I just received this keyboard today, and holy smokes! this thing is fantastic, switching from a macbook keyboard to this is a bit challenging, cuz the keys on desktop keyboard have less surface area than laptop keyboards. I got the Non-RGB version, that is the rainbow version which fixed colors that you cannot change,  for INR 2600 during the great Indian sale, which is a good price for this keyboard compared to it's original price that is INR 3100. The chassis is constructed of aluminium alloy and plastics  and the keyboard itself is very heavy and sturdy and weighs around 1 Kg, the cable is of excellent quality, it is very thick and is 3 feet long. The USB is gold plated which is a nice addition. This keyboard is hot swappable that means that you can swap out the switches of the keyboard, the keyboard comes with outemu red switches which are cherry MX clones but are a bit more clicky than the cherry MXs, it also comes with 5 spare red switches in case you need to replace a key.In-Box contents:KeyboardManualStickerKeycap-pullerSwitch-puller5 spare outemu red switchesOverall very happy with my purchase would recommend it anytime, buy it with your eyes closed. Again I got it for around 2600 which is really cheap for a mechanical keyboard that is this good.Will update my review after 6 months of use!Thanks for reading!"
5,This keyboard screams build quality when you open the box. The keyboard is very sturdy and hard. You can even use this as a weapon in case someone attacks you. You get enough RGB effects which are very bright and you will love them. The keys are of  Outemu Blue Switches and gives a clicky feel when pressed. Those clicks are very satisfactory and soothing to hear.Only downside is the software is not working but you can use the K582 SURARA software to control this keyboard. I personally use the  K582 software as this keyboard's software does not install for some reason.
3,"Think before buying. Only after one month of usage the T key has started giving issues, at some cases it takes 3 looooooong presses for the T o appear. For this review also I am trying o press hard on he key o make i work. But all he places you are no seeing the 'T' means, it didnt come even afer trying more than thrice. Invest in a better one if you are really looking for a long lasting keyboard. Having said that, the look and feel is amazing but wha's the need when he keys do not work."
2,It was a good keyboard for the price until about 1 month month in - the keys started to not work properly - one press registered as multiple. I barely used the keyboard for 2 hours per day.Service is a hassle as it's only done in Mumbai(have to ship it and hope for the best) and there's no guarantee being given that the warranty will cover it.If a keyboard starts malfunctioning less than 2 months from purchase (and 2 hours per day average use) and they call it as wear and tear - proves the keyboard is not sturdy.I have a 4 year old Logitech wireless keyboard(cost me 1.1k) that works better than this.Pros:It was really good until the malfunctioning. I had much better inputs in my platform fighting games and there was no key ghosting. Worth the price if it lasted long.
4,"This is my first mechanical keyboard. The keyboard feels very sturdy and is heavy. The key took some getting used to, as the keys on the both edges are slightly elevated. The RGB effects are good, albeit the print on the keys should have been more prominent, the visibility is not great in daylight. Pretty much impressed with the keys, does the job well. Had to replace the keyboard once, as the first one had random disconnection issues."
4,"The build is solid with no deck flex whatsoever. The keys are pretty decent. The lighting effects are pretty nice too. But I don't like the font at all. It's just too much. Minimal fonts is where it's at. Manufacturers have got to get over this stereotypical ""gamer"" aesthetic. Other than that it's a pretty solid keyboard."
5,This is one of the cheapest as well as the best blue switch mechanical keyboard... If u r looking for keyboards then corsair and hyperx are nice but at this price they only provide membrane keyboard.... If u want a mechanical keyboard then just close ur eyes are just go for it......
5,"Been using it for month, and enjoy every bit of it. No issue work great, recommend it to anyone looking for a entry price mechanical keyboard. BTW bought it for far less than the current price on Amazon itself !!"
4,"The keyboard is well built and the red knockoffs work as they are supposed to. They do feel a little springy (cranky?) when pressing them but unless you have tried better switches, you would barely be able to tell it. I bought the rainbow version as it comes with Red switches, they are not very loud and are very smooth with a very small actuation force required. However if you are going to press them fully (which you are not supposed to do), they will feel very heavy.Unfortunately I received a minor defect in my product. The A key is misprinted, and to be honest it is not a very big issue however it does bother me quite a lot. It feels quite off and annoys me."
4,"I was using a blue key cosmic byte gk 16 for the past 6 months, shifting to this was one of the best things I have done. It uses less force on activation. If you are one of the guys looking for tactile feedback, this is not for you. The red keys offer less sound compared to blue ones, just what I needed to annoy my roommate less.Overall build of the keyboard is good, the LEDs are bright and if you need in depth reviews, you can look it up in youtube.And yes, the keys are hot-swappableThis is not easy to carry tho, weighs a little over a KG I guess."
5,"I am really impressed for the quality and the feel of the key when you press, this is something you really get satisfied for the price you paid. if you look at any other brand for mechanical key board which will cost way more than this. if you are looking of mechanical key board for best look and performance go for this."
5,Keyboard is sturdy with good typing experience. Keys are small in size and very close to each other as compared to traditional KB. But this is not resulting in inconvenience. I will post an updated review after few days of usage.
1,"Stops working sometime no response no light noting you need to put out the usb and and need to plug in again. Happens at least once in a day,really annoying.No media keys and rgb customization is quite odd with same model number in youtube you can find some different customization.No white led system. No information about warranty. Is there any service center avaliable in kolkata? Else if any problem occurs its dead."
1,"Doesn't feel like a mechanical keyboard. You feel 0 resistence until the key travels about 15%-20% of the travel distance. A major disappointment as after less than 3 months of use, some of the keys seem to require more force than others and the keyboard does feel like it's a membrane keyboard/mechanical feel type of a keyboard. You'd rather shell out more and just buy a mechanical keyboard from a reliable vendor."
5,Video Player is loading.
5,The keyboard is good but I would suggest to get the RGB version as the rainbow one can get a little jarring sometimes because you can't choose a single color.It would be worth it to shell out the extra cash for the RGB version if you're going to be using it for a long time otherwise just talking about the keyboard it's worth it the switches are smooth and relatively silent. At this price range it's good for gaming as well as typing.
5,Wow amazing fit and finish.
4,Quality is really goodPrice is high.
5,"Best quality and accurate size, durable and reliable."
5,"I originally used a mouse pad without support and after I changed over, it was night and day. My wrist isn't under near as much stress and the material feels really nice and looks great on my desk. I use my computer for a living so, this was a great investment. The keyboard pad, for me at first, was just a bonus, but now after having used it, I couldn't type without it. Very much recommend and would buy again. Thank you Amazon for super quick delivery."
4,"I'm posting this after 3 days of usage.Its length exactly matches my keyboard.Foam is good , it is strong. Bottom layer is rubber , it also seems fine . No issues for mouse also. For long hours of typing or playing games I recommend this ."
5,"It is awesome, if you use it for the purpose for it is meant: office work. As long as you use it without sharp objects poking around, food or drinks while using it, you will be fine. Make sure you don't sweat alot because that will be the knell for this. I don' think this is washable. Very comfortable though. Great for this price."
4,Good product
4,Product it pretty nice. You won't regret after buying this. Very comfortable while using. Meterial is good so far now.
5,I absolutely love my keyboard cushion set. I have a bad habit of resting my elbows on my metal desk top which causes pain alot. Now I do not have to worry about that anymore thanks to this product. Thick and well made. I think it will last me a long time.
5,I'm a gamer so this helps my hands not hurt on the keyboard. The mouse in still getting used to but it does help me not put pressure on my wrist causing pain. So it definitely does help & it is very soft
5,I love this mouse pad. I need to order another one for work. I have spent the last 5 plus years typing as part of my job and my wrist bothers me at times. Having this mouse pad to rest my wrist on helps tremendously! Thanks Amazon
5,This is really a good product if you are working 9-10 hours a day than definitely your wrists need some rest. Soft cushion padding helps alot for everyday work while typing and using mouse.
5,"I'm in LOVE with these!! they are perfect, and so cushiony they feel like memory foam!!! I'm so happy with this purchase I needed something like this SO BAD for work! :)"
5,"You will need these wrist rest pad to work or game better, reasonable price for quality material made. Thanks Amazon"
1,"Bought it two days ago. Outside packaging was good but original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle was missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement."
5,"Excellent keyboard and mouse combo. Silent touch is very nice, I can't hear any sound from keyboard very quiet. I like it is water proof and has vents and holes in the bottom to drain any accidental spills. Mouse works and tracks nicely, accurate to the clicks and double clicks. One dongle only for the keyboard and mouse so no need to worry about using up 2 ports. Both mouse and keyboard has a place to plug the USB dongle while not in use so you don't fear of losing. Also both mouse and keyboard has on-off buttons so you can save battery by switching it off by your end of day."
3,"No issues with the functioning of the keyboard and mouse. They are both working well. I am satisfied with the ""silent"" feature. However, I found the keyboard keys slightly harder on the fingers than I would like. And my biggest issue is, the mouse doesn't come with rubber base. So it slips if you use it on a slanted table/desk. It's not even standing on normal mouse pads. I have to find a mouse pad that has a non-smooth antislip surface.Update after 6 months of minimal usage : Left button of the mouse stopped working. The mouse is useless now."
5,"The keyboard is excellent. As described in the product description it is very silent. I can’t hear it over my fan. That is more than good enough for me. I bought this product assuming that I can connect it to Logitech unifying receiver. I have a M720 mouse which I love to bits. I wanted to give this mouse to my wife and use just the keyboard. I realized only after unboxing that it will only work with the USB dongle it came with. I wanted to return the product, I tried using the keyboard for a day and decided the keyboard alone was worth paying the 2,500 and I kept the product. I wish the keyboard is supported by the Logitech options software. I could have changed the key binding of some of the shortcut keys given at the top.Don’t get me wrong mouse is not bad, it just too small for me. I am very used to my M720 which is almost as big as MX Master. Mouse tracking is good. But, as mentioned in some other reviews it is super light and have very little resistance on a wooden table. It just flies from one corner of the screen to another. May be with some use I can get used to the weight of this mouse. It is not a fair comparison to compare this to my M720 as that mouse alone cost almost twice as much as this combo. This mouse is supported by the Logitech options software and you can assign around 5 shortcuts to the mouse which is great to see at this price point."
1,Very poor order delivery. First time the order was received without the usb receiver. Returned and reordered. The rellace.ent came without the mouse !!
3,"After 2 days:Keyboard is not working in Mac and Ubuntu/Linux OS.I need to close to the USB receiver ( 2-5cm distance) in order to work.For this price 2395 it is not worth.Other keyboard K220 bought a year before working fine. Need a replacement.Initial Impression:This is one of the best keyboard and mouse i ever used.Typing speed is absolutly very smooth and there is no key press sound. Very little noise but it wont disturb any one who is near by.Mouse is really silky smooth and no click sound at all.only thing it has very soft keys no soundmouse is really smooth and very silent.Price wise this is little high 2395, if it is 1999 it would be best value for money.one USB nano receiver is great to handle both keyboard and mouse.I am using this keyboard for my raspberry pi 4. Since RPI4 has limitted USB ports so using this one USB receiver is really helpful."
1,5 stars for product but 2 stars for seller.Product received was not seal packed. I could make out that tapes were opened and then re-pasted. The mouse from keyboard mouse combo was not working. Keyboard was working very well.So i placed return with replacement order. I received the replacement within a day but i was scared looking at the condition of the replaced product box. It was battered with tape applied instead of original seal tape. I have uploaded photographs of the packing.Fortunately this time both mouse and keyboard are working and are working good.
3,"I received the the product in just 9 hours, delivery wise and packaging wise everything was good, the boxes were in very good condition without any damageChanging my comment on the product in just two days.  1) I feel the key press should have been little more softer  2) I did one test with this keyboard and the dell laptop keyboard in the night when it completely pin drop silence  environment.  what i observed was that the dell laptop keyboard is also not silent but the key press noise is lower  compare to the Logitech keyboard.  i tried typing few sentences with the Logitech keyboard and same sentences again with the dell laptop  keyboard.  3) if you type slow also there is noise on the key press.  4) found that only the alpha keys , numeric keys(not the numpad keys) , arrow keys,  5) space bar, tab, enter, shift, alt, ctrl key are somewhat silent compared to the alpha and numeric keys  6) Price is very high  and the usb receiver is also not unifying one at this price.  7) even the click of the mouse button is not silent as mentioned. I have Logitech M331, which is way silent than  the M220 mouse provided with the keyboard.reducing my rating of this product just because it does not meet the requirement of silent touch, also i have given the product 3 star just because it is not that bad as well if you see the other aspects of product like the plastic quality is good, you have volume control option and also I don't have any doubt on the battery life because i have already used Logitech product earlier as well and they proved to be lasting longer compared to dell mouse where i used to change the batteries twice or thrice in a month."
5,"i liked the keyboard, i have the habit working late with my kids working beside. typing my older keyboards wake up my kid and disturb his sleep. this is one is so silent soft work. very sift srispy typing feel i get. it has capslock indicator which is sufficient for as numlocks and scroll locks i hardly use.Mouse too is very silent soft. it has very high promising battery life, hop it lasts long.It has been 8 months, now i observe first signs of low battery, connectivity issues comes up. Yes alkaline batteries do last long, really long in this keyboard"
5,"Writing this review after one week of use.It is a very good quality combo set of keyboard and mouse.. Received in perfect condition. Keyboard and Mouse both are super silent (no tik-tik anymore). Full size keyboard. Medium size mouse (Model: M220-SilentTouch). Just plug the tiny receiver, switch ON the keyboard and Mouse buttons and it immediately starts working. Get rid of hassles of wiresI had also checked Logitech MK270R combo which was approx. Rs.1000 less than this but finally decided to go with this due to the factors such as Silent Touch, Longer Battery Life and Newer Model. And after using it for a week, I think it was a good decision.I recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of wiring around their PC/Laptop and looking for clean desk.Overall a very nice product and good buy."
5,"Finally the best after trying 3 different one, tired the Dell entry level combo (that was undoubted worst) then tried Logitech MK345 it works like a typewriter ( key punch sounds) , sold that on olx for half the price when I purchased this one . Not about the product . Its just AWSOME ! , the key feel and the mouse both . Keyboard is very well built and feels great . Both keyboard and mouse have rugged feel when you touch. Its great in the Work from Home environment specially if you work late night and don't want to disturb  someone with the keystrokes and mouse clicks . Not only keyboard even the mouse clicks are (almost) noise less . This is not 100% silent but no one should be able to hear and gets disturbed by the keystroke noise . if you want to quantify of noise eradication will it eradicates more than 90-95% key click noise"
4,Wow.. i am really surprised with this keyboard. This is exactly what i was looking for in a keyboard all my life. I have been searching for a keyboard where i dont get those irritated clicking noise in my mouse and keyboard both and wanted a very soft touching slient option. My search ended here. But my search was little ruined as the layout of the keyboard is not to my taste.The buttons dont have spacing between them. Even the lines between keys are not much. I want a better layout to make this as perfect choice of keyboard for life.I like big layout style keyboard for faster typing speeds along with hand rest at the bottom and multimedia keys for faster handling of medias.
1,"The moment I opened the package, I could see that it was already opened by someone and then put together half heartedly. I anyway gave it a chance and connected to my laptop. The connection was fast and there was no visible lag. However, the keys were malfunctioning a lot. Changing language automatically, some of the keys not working at times (you have to remove the receiver and plug it in again). I have raised a request for the replacement. Will update once the replacement is here."
4,"What I like:1. Excellent keyboard. Just the right weight, sturdy, does not slide away when you type, good wireless connection, smooth & silent typing, good travel of keys. Note: This keyboard makes absolutely no sound at all and if you are one who enjoys your keyboard's sound - this is not the product for you.2. The mouse is precise in its working. Clicks are silent.3. Product is well packaged. The receiver is kept in an easily accessible place in the carton box.4. There is a place to store the receiver (below the keyboard), if you wish to carry the product around.What could have been better:1. The mouse is very small for my hand. For this price, they could have given a full size mouse. The current mouse is not comfortable to use if you have medium to large hands.2. The scroll wheel of the mouse is very noisy.2. The caps-lock LED is almost useless as it is too dim to be visible during the day."
5,"The keys are silent - they don't make clicky noises. That's not to say it doesn't make sound, it does. It's just muffled and low-frequency.The keys are sturdy and seem to be of good quality for the price. I personally feel there's a bit too much resistance though. Typing casually is fine, but if you're a writer and write multiple pages per day, maybe you should consider chicklet style keys. I use this primarily for work, to compose a few emails per day, interact with others on chat, and create occasional documents, and I have been very satisfied with it. On long typing sessions, it sure gives your fingers a workout, but it's not a deal breaker."
4,"The keyboard is extremely quiet, although the typing is not that comfortable due to the key feedback being a little too hard. Maybe that will be ok after getting used to it.Separate indicator for caps lock but none for num lock. Otherwise keyboard has all the keys in the right place.Truly plug and play with both Ubuntu and Windows"
4,"This is a good product. I am writing this review after using this keyboard-mouse combo for around 1 month and I am satisfied with this product.Keyboard is about 90% silent and is easy to use; no tak-tak noise but still some sort of sound is there while typing, which is ok. Also Mouse is working good and has a good grip."
4,"I don’t think I can get used to using this silent touch, basically compared to the mechanical keyboard I have used, I think I keep getting the keys wrong always, it feels small and does not fit well. The typing experience is a bit down but it’s super silent for one and has the promised wireless. Basically I needed it for using whenever I get on bed, so it doesn’t father me much now, but as a main keyboard it lacks at a lot of places, at this price range"
4,Box was a mess(the sets box). But the product itself is very very silent. If you using mk270 then the difference will be the feel of mesh can be felt clearly. So if you dont mind little hard on gaming you can go for it else 270 or some other i guess? Only 4 stars since box is ruined.Ps: The switch sure helps out the battery.
1,The keyboard isn't working properly. There is so much lag sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Such a pathetic product with such high price. Bought it after reading reviews but all my money got wasted. Logitech being such a big and famous brand selling such kind of products. Shame!!
4,Overall product is good. I cannot comment on battery as its news so use ur judgement. The only sketchy part is the on/off slide switch they are of plastic and i don't know how long would they survive esp the mouse one.. I felt they should have used the metal switch like dell which could be robust for the price we are paying. That's it for now. Cheers!
1,"I bought this product and found Keyboard is not working properly. I had requested for replacement of the product. But, the replaced product was not in good condition at all. I have returned all the keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle. However, the replaced product which I got today looks like the original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle were missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement.  I need to apply for replacement again which is really annoying. I think whoever from Amazon is reviewing these comments should immediately act on it to get the good sealed product with good condition should be delivered on time."
5,"Very good and interesting product. The silence while typing is very weird initially cause the feeling of keys while typing is same. Only complaint would be that mouse is size small and not most ergonomic, but cant complain too much at this price point."
5,A good keyboard with silent touch and mouse with silent click as expected. So far working well. Hope it lasts well. The functioning of the keys is much better than the earlier Logitech model that I was using.Packet delivery was professional.
3,"It is actually a silent keyboard when compared to other regular keyboards. Although it has some sound though from the key travel, it's not loud enough to disturb anyone outside the room. I am using a full size keyboard after years and it's actually quite comfortable after you get used to it.I do not like the mouse at all. It's not ergonomic design so using it for long working sessions is very uncomfortable. But that's least of the problems. The mouse hangs between two monitors which is very annoying. I have tried adjusting the settings but this problem hasn't resolved."
5,To unleash the full potential download Logitech Options software from Logitech to customize the mouse buttons and actions. To customize keyboard download Karabiner-Elements and you can map all the keys.Overall the experience is splendid and the keys are great for typing!!
5,"Logitech MK295 wireless keyboard and M220 wireless mouse combo is a great buy in terms of product quality. Buttons are really silent. This combo stands up to my expectation in terms of quality. I believe the Price is a little on higher side. If it could be priced in range of INR 1800 - INR 2000, it would make this product Superb value for money."
5,"I have used many logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the past, but this model is fun to use, just because of its silent feature. Many in the past has failed due to mouse click issues and dongle issues, hope this lives to the expectation."
5,"I was using mk275 logitech prior to this. Had a bad experience with that one, noisy keys, with couple of keys not working properly. Was skeptical about this one. BUT - this is an excellent keyboard. It really is silent! no noise. All keys have excellent feel, not missing any letters. It also has a capslock indicator. I would say its really a great keyboard and mouse combo. Go for it."
1,"the keyboard is great and very sleek and silent. but couple of keys not working when i used it. unfortunately i noticed the issue after the return window elapsed. now i am left with a keyboard without caps lock ,shift key and number 7"
3,"Its a decent keyboard with backlit RGB. Considering the cost range, I was honestly not expecting state of the art ergonomics or RGB, for the prize range it does provide good value for money. However, you expect product to work atleast for a year without giving issues. For me, many keys did not work as expected after first 3 months. Apart from that, till the time it worked, it was a decent piece."
4,"Update: 2nd May 2019.....Changing rating from 3 to 4 stars. 5 months of gaming usage and it is still working!The product picture showed is not what I received. Two days of usage and the space bar gets stuck time and again. The keys feel very delicate hence this is not for heavy gaming. Perhaps not even casual gaming. Anyways, at this price do not expect a gaming keyboard.Update 8th Dec: Ordered a replacement and received it. Will post the update after using it at least for a week or two.Update 15th Dec: 1 week of gaming usage and the product is still alive. At the price I bought I think 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
5,"Got this Keyboard for Office use, the keyboard is sturdy doesn’t make noise and didn observe any cons ;If you are working from Home using your laptop I would recommend to get this keyboard or any other keyboard; we tend to type hard sometimes ; laptops are delicate and single key issue would make you run towards a service centre !"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
2,It felt like a really cheap keyboard although it actually is a cheap keyboard but still the feel while typing or doing any work and the quality of the keys the press nothing was impressive I felt like a better keyboard in a just a little more budget would be far better than this but if I was trip budget then you can go for this you can easily do your work and it won't disappoint you.
5,I received the keyboard in a sealed packing however the mouse pad mention on the box was missing inside the package when opened. I am returning the shipment and expecting a replacement.
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
3,"keyboard is awesome but i have use it more than 2 months its alphabets are fating down ,color nikal raha haii , aagar typing ke liya lena hai ti mat lo bekar haii ungliya dard ho jayengii ,gaming ke liya  thik thak haiii but uttna aacha nahii ahii 1k ki price maii aur v aata ahii thoda aur jodka corsear ke keyboard aata haii wahii lo best ahiii gaming aur coding aur typing ke liya best ."
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
5,"Very smooth around the edges and the keypress.,Prints on key also looks appealing.keys are silent.not a gaming keyboard tho.lets see how long it lasts ."
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,Produxt went bad within 1month of purchase and due to pandamic we arr not able to replace as visiting service center will take more time
2,Appearance is good. The functionality is worst. Some keys won't function and some keys repeats if you press once.
4,Quality of keyboard is acceptable in comparison to its price.
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
1,With great hope I have order combo but I have received damaged mouse ...it's very disappointed ...so I return the product and order another one hope I would be getting good quality product.
3,"USB cable is of very poor quality and very thin. But for the price, no complaints. Not suitable for gaming."
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,"Amount was reasonable, very smooth for handling too may be. But I don't know why the package was not good and safe because when I opened I found two broken pieces of Keyboard. Immediately clicked for a return."
1,Worst product ..... Received item in damaged condition twice.... Intex is much better .... Purchased intex .... And now I am working with it.
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
1,For one click it types more alphabetsSome time keys not functionsWhat to do now return date also overRaw material smells
2,The keyboard start giving issue in 2 mths where the keywords does not work and enters wrongs alphabet
3,Satisfied the product
1,"After 2 months of use, the keys are getting stuck when pressed. Do not buy it."
5,Excellent product
4,First thing is that I didn't received the Mouse Pad with keyboard as said in product title.
3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
5,"The rationale behind the purchasing the keyboard was that it has Laptop style chiclet keys that I am used to. And this keyboard has exactly that. This extends that experience for my Desktop. With the added convenience of being full size, Wireless, thin, having Premium Feel, a silent mouse and excellent battery. The most Important Feature is that it is portable, The wireless receiver connects to both devices at same time and even just one of the devices. So you can carry your mouse with you if you need just a mouse for a laptop. The keyboard and mouse both have a slot for keeping the receiver so that it doesn't get lost. Thats very convenient. Above all, the keyboard and Mouse have an aesthetic appeal to it when it's on your Desk, it looks clean. It doesn't look like everyother black and bulky keyboard-mouse that everyone uses.So for all the above reasons, this is a perfect product for work and that's what you pay for, it is correctly priced, the difference between a mechanical keyboard and this is night and day in my experience. It's worth every penny as you enjoy typing on this and get that premium satisfying experience daily as you work."
4,"I wanted a chiclet style keyboard as I am a software developer and I just felt like I typed the fastest on a chiclet style laptop keyboard. I got the Logitech K380 for this purpose as it felt portable and had good build quality, but unfortunately suffered from not registering multiple keyboard keys at once and being so small for me that I started having wrist pain within 2 days.I saw this combo and even though I only needed the keyboard, I got this from another seller in Off-White version. Unfortunately that seller sent me the Graphite version, I instantly placed a return request, but still was able to try the keyboard. The keyboard felt amazing to type on, I was at my full speed (75WPM) and there was no wrist pain.I returned the Graphite one and waited for Off-White to be available. Appario Retail made the Off-White available and I ordered it ASAP. Today, got it delivered and I couldn't be more happier.Curiously the Off-White version has better textured plastic and does not feel cheap like, unlike the Graphite version which somehow felt lower quality plastic. I can connect to Logitech Options and set my own shortcuts for 4 function keys. I do a lot of gaming too and I can vouch this is as good as a good gaming laptop keyboard if not better.I just hope Logitech could have provided backlight on the keyboard at this cost. Lets hope the battery lasts atleast half of what Logitech claims, but I think it will."
5,"Sure to be satisfied if all you want is a light weight, compact, silent, comfortable smooth keys. The mouse is super SILENT. I love it and the keys are an ABSOLUTE pleasure to type on. I feel the key size is just perfect, any smaller would be too small. Special keys are sized appropriately in most cases.Overall superb compact keyboard probably one of the best out there.Too much real estate wasted on the top panel area where the battery only occupies 20-30 % space and the rest of the space is just hollow. Could have been designed to accommodate more keys with more functions or simply reduced the size further. Or at least made it a secret storge compartment lol ;-) what a waste of space.NO caps lock indicator. Not multi device."
3,Soft mouse and keypad. Keyboard is sturdy but soft and elegant! Mouse is pretty small and so smooth and it reminds of luxury! It looks great on the table!! It's simply WOW. If price is not a deciding factor just buy it right now and don't waste your time searching for a better product than this - you might not find one!After 5 days: I found that the Ctrl key (left bottom) was very loose and it used to produce a little noise everytime I press it. I ordered a replacement and again I had the same issue. Finally I had to return that too. Maybe there is a problem with the whole batch of keyboards. I am sad that I cant keep this but for a super premium keyboard the keys should be very sturdy at least on day one! Except that one key - this product just rocks!!
5,Far better than the usual keyboard and mouse combo. The keyboard may be compact but has heft and feels really good. The mouse has soft clicks and alao feels great. Happy with my purchase.
5,"Pros- helps with fast typing- no clack clack clack- smooth, perfect feedback- sturdyCons- none for me so far.Note: Its okay to spend on things you end up using the most in a day. :)"
5,Beautiful product (I bought white colour Mose and keyboard). Goes well with my MacBook .Very sleek and presentable. Build quality is superb.Works like a breeze and paired effortlessly with my laptop.Would recommend for work from home.
5,This is a good wireless keyboard.This includes number pad.It is very slim
5,very smooth keys and good material. heavy in weight so that didn't move while working.
4,Looks greater in person than in the photo..worth the buy
5,"It's a perfect keyboard and mouse, I liked it very much. This colour is awesome and matches my wfh setup. Battery life is also best in segment."
5,Satisfied with their build quality and it works very well with macbook pro
5,"Good tactile key feedback, very convenient to hold, ergonomic and silent!"
3,Perfect ergonomic design mouse & keyboard but didn't receive unifying USB receiver as per the product description.
4,"While working with both the portable magic keyboard and this one, I didn't notice much difference in terms of the hardness and the bounce, and the travel of the keys. Both are equally fatiguing the hands because there is no rubbery feel on the keys. The harder you push the keys the harder it throws your fingers back, in form of mechanical reaction from the base of the key, the sooner you get tired.No keyboard is good or bad, we need to recalibrate our fingers to ""depress"" (no hard press) the keys as if extra force would cause pain to the keys. Acquiring a new behavior for every new keyboard does wonders and makes you fall in love with it, else be ready to keep on changing and finding faults with them until you found one luckily custom-made for you. I have already gone through this tiring process and ultimately learning the basics using Newtonian physics. Happy hunting!"
5,"Its a good model, tho it lacks keypad on right but its so slim and smooth. Longggg battery life and easy to use. I am using it for both gaming and work purpose. And easily portable"
2,"Was not latching smoothly and frequently getting disconnected, hence returned"
5,Good
5,"Its just wonderful.Amazing performance , and typing experience is unbeleivable."
5,Compact and comfortable to use.
1,"Keys are coming out while working, battery indicator not working, quality is not good according to price"
4,"I bought this a month ago, and trust me, the keyboard is absolutely bang for the buck. Although its body is made of plastic, the build quality is amazing. Now for the mouse, the mouse is very bad. It's scroll wheel is the major con. It's very hard to scroll with it .So,If you're looking for a budget gaming keyboard, I would recommend you this.But, if you're also looking for a good mouse, I don't recommend you this."
4,Good quality.close your eyes and go for it.😻i recommend you to buy this combo because nobody has given to you this type of features and quality on this price range.if you are finding rgb keyboard combo then this will fulfill your requirement .i really appreciate to ANT ESPORT .❤️
4,"I honestly expected trash, but this is surprisingly good...The keyboard and mouse are well built.The keys feel almost mechanical but the texture and the backlight of the keys themselves could have been better.The mouse is nice. With 6 buttons, and of course it has no lag.If it starts to do wierd things right after the initial connection, don't worry it happened to me too. But they just fadded away quickly.And also it's a steal if a deal for this money."
5,"Not a mechanical keyboard, but definitely worth the money. Durable and good quality. Backlight has some fixed combinations only. Palm rest makes sure of the good position of hand during gaming. Mouse is also very good and worth the money. Can't change the colour of the mouse, it automatically cycles between different colours.If you are looking for a combo, then this is the best one at this price."
5,"the keyboard is very very very smooth !!!!  and responsive. functions and RGB lighting is really attractive. i bought this at 1800 rs , i thing now it seems only 1700 rs . at this price range this is a great buy form amazon!the mouse is also good but u have to consider the logitec mouses. good response, awsome lighting and it has 3 or 4 sensitivities . if you are looking for a combo of mouse and keyboard this guy is the best of 2021..."
5,Looks coolThe box was in very bad conditionThe product is fabThe lightning is good........but the mouse front side if could also light up would be betterThe keyboard cable does not seem as firm as the mouse cable isOverall this product is best in this budget.
5,When i opened the box i saw that the keyboard worked fine but was broken and the mouse's dpi changer was also broken. Please send an appropriate product without any defects.
4,"its a very nice keyboard overall, the RGB makes it look supercool,it has mechanical keyboard. some may not like the buttons making sound beacuase they are little upward than usual keyboard but most of the people do like mechanical keys because they get handy easilyotherwise there is no any other issues"
1,After one week it is not working good when i press a windows key it is opening something else every time.It is not worth to buy it
1,Mouse not working and not responding sometime during playing or any working for 3 to 5 seconds
5,Best best best at this price. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
1,This is very attractive keyboard but within 2 months got unserviceable. There is no any service center near by you. Only one in Delhi. I send this product to delhi for repair with own courier expense. It is simply rebranding of a Chinese product.
5,Both keyboard and mouse is extremely VFM highly recommended best for gaming.
3,I ordered product 2 times it's was defective both times it's good product for budget but the seller should check before sending package my keyboard is broken I unboxed it and the hand rest was broken
5,quality is good
4,Its is valve for money.Good build  quality. Can compare with mechanical keyboard.
5,It Is Very Good Combo At Thisprice You Should Purchase It Without thinking Its Very Impressive  Combo
1,When I receive the product esc button was broken from backside also it was broken
4,Nice product
5,i loved it rgb function on this product as well as the typing comfort is sooo smooth.....
5,Excellent product. Just the way I expected works like a charm
5,Very good best value for money itemThank you
3,Good for normal and daily use
3,POOR
4,"But since of good service nd return policy, it was a great nd easy  service"
4,Good quality but price is little bit high
4,"Nice product, rgb effects are lit.. Many options with running lights, breathing lights, static, defined keystroke lights...Keys are okayish..Looks plastic..I dont know if its actually aluminium body..Rigid keyboard though..not for rough use.. Overall its good.. but the price here on amazon is more than the price on the actual website.. I got for ₹1500 while on their official website it's of ₹1299.."
5,"It's been 9 months Im using this board... This is extremely good.. the mechanism to control the light was great that's not affecting our eyes.....but it would be much great if it has more light effects and the key movement is quite smooth we don't get any feeling like a mechanical board....it will be just like a membrane but with a better performance  but only  the keys ""spacebar"" and ""shift key""  both will definitely be like mechanical keys 😂 but totally this is great for this price affordable... I would recommend everyone...."
3,"Key quality will detiriorate over time, not as smooth after a few months of use and keys at times get stuck mid press.Will attract a lot of dust but is easy to clean.Suffers from ghosting occasionally."
1,Recived a used and dirty keyboard the packaging was also very bad and broken (pics attached) going to return it.
5,This is perfect everything was as expected and as shown this is incredible if you are a gamer don't think it's made for you
5,It's a mechanical feel membrane keyboard and it is doing its duty perfectly.
4,Product is good but seems like got a second hand product from Amazon though its workin well till now i can give it 4 Star.
5,This Is a Really Good Keyboard At This Price Range You Should Definitely Go For This!
5,Very very awesome keyboard and fully metal and heavy
5,Absolutely beautiful. I’m using another silicon keyboard cover for my desktop keyboard but this one is so much more premium to touch. Almost feels like there is nothing on the keyboard.
5,"I searched a lot for the best macbook m1 air keyboard cover. and atlast i got it.bought almost 6 covers and returned all of them. some of them came with macbook case.  everyone i bought previously was very low quality, bends everywhere etc.but this product is so unique and the best.higly recommended."
5,"I really love the look of the keypad cover.The material plastic is also very durable and good in quality. The packaging is really nice and protective.The sheet is absouletly transparent and its made up of good quality , i like the fitting.Its protecting the keys as a gaurd. Value for money. Protection is top level. Fast delivery also"
5,Fits the new macbook air perfectly. Super happy with this buy. Go for it. It was very neatly packed. Very impressive keyboard skin.
5,Fully satisfied with the product.product delivered in time.packeging was nice.
4,Ordered this macbook air 13inch keyboad cover transperent sheet.Its good simple and usefull.But I felt price was high for this.Otherthan that product was good.
4,It does not fit perfectly but does the job though. There is no any kind of  adhesive ...
3,It does not have a good grip over keyboard and usually it slips off as it does not have any adhesive or something sticky so that it can have a form grip
1,"The quality is very poor, has no adhesion, the grooves are not fit in the keys (keyboard) which makes typing very hard. Total waste of money."
5,"It's fits perfectly and is transparent, helped a lot to keep my mac clean.Also it can be cleaned with wet clothGreat for your Mac."
4,"Typing is not as fast when cover is used...Due to the soft material, you need to push a little hard and therefore it reduces typing speed"
4,It is perfect in size and sticks wellAmazing product worthful can easily type and avoid dust
5,Nice fit. Have no complains.
4,Works but too flimsy. I could have paid some more money for better build. Afraid it might not last very long but keeping it.Fn + C to enable it to be discovered over BT
5,Keyboard & Touchpad working properly. Very Happy with the product.... It's useful can connect with ipad as well as android phones too.
5,"The keyboard is lightweight, very slim but sturdy when kept on a desk or lap.Overall, a recommended purchase if you’re looking for a Multidevice Bluetooth keyboard. Probably the best in this price range."
5,"I recently got our DOMO wireless blutooth keyboard with trackpad from amzon.in,  it is excellent Design and build quality is superb."
5,Its totally worth it. Amazing keyboard. It just like that as i expected. Very nice product. Thanks.Go for it.
1,"The reason why I have to work more in this WFH, is this keyboard. every time when I type anything on this keyboard it misses many letters. and soon after writing the long comments, I realize many words are incomplete or type incompletely/incorrectly.My personal opinion is to look for some other better options or go with a wired keyboard. I can't comment in there exists such an issue with every wireless keyboard or specifically with my model.Other worst thing happened to me is that I contacted Amazon on the day when the replacement window got closed.But what can I do, on that day I realized it was something that is happening very frequently and I can't work like this. First they said they will help me get it replaced as I am a valuable customer and later on contacting them back they started explaining me their policies.I this time I can't even visit service center, and even if I do then no guarantee they will get it done asap.So better buy any other product based on my experience with it.Thanks...."
5,"Here's my detailed product review (also testing out the keyboard as I type this!).Delivery from Amazon took less than 24 hours. Although the product comes in a see through packaging from Amazon so the original Lenovo carton is visible when you receive the product. Nothing that one should be worried about though.The keyboard:The keyboard is adequately sized. The key spacing is perfect to my linking and typing on it feels very smooth with no clicking sound from the keys. It features three LED indicators for caps lock, num lock and what appears to be a low battery indicator. Keep in mind though that the indicators don't stay on - they go off after a few seconds so it is difficult to tell if the caps/num lock key is ON by looking at the indicators. They do however clearly indicate that the key was pressed or released. Not really a pain point. The keyboard uses a single AAA cell that comes in the box. The physical appearance of the keyboard is alright - nothing very fancy. The keys have a frosted ""top"" with white lettering and the key edges have a glossy black finish. Stand out feature- it has a volume control keys on the top row!!The mouse:I have been using the Logitech m235 wireless mouse for the last two years and have grown used to it so the one thing that I notice with this mouse is the speed. I have had to bump up the mouse pointer speed setting under windows  to the maximum with almost any mouse that I have used. For this one I feel I may have to lower that setting. Having said that the precision and accuracy is really good for my work (I don't do any graphic/CAD design though so I wouldn't know if this suits those requirements). It runs off a AA battery that comes in the box and has a recess underneath to house the USB receiver in whenever you're not using it. It is also provided with an ON/OFF slider switch. Compared to the keyboard I find that the appearance of the mouse is better than the keyboard's with a neat glossy black trim wrapping around the mouse with matt black finish on top with the Lenovo branding.Bottom line: If you're looking for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse, you should go for it . Even without being a full multimedia keyboard it has Volume control keys that is a real plus point. I got it from Cloudtail for 999 as a lightning deal."
1,"Actually i don't like to Write negative feedback for any  product unless the product was fault or not worthy,And this Product With name brand lenovo but i'm not sure its Original,5 months only used this - 12 batteries replaced, okay i adjust that and used,And now Mouse Scroll not Working, its going to trash hereafter,This is BIGSCAM in eCommerce, it has Serial Number Informations, i tried to check with Lenovo website but the device didn't recognised,Cheap Product, Only Buy If its come with 600-700rs. offer, Don't waste your money!!Believe me, You regret it! Definitely its not worth your 1400rs."
4,"Value of Money, Good Product, if you use key board for any android device, first change settings under key board, and set remote key board then only your enter key word else while pressing enter key it reflect 'q'. overall nice deal, fast delivery from amazon got @ 850/- under lightning deal with 15% cash back."
2,"I Purchased this product because reviews showed me that the product have light indicator when the caps lock key is turned on or off, but this is not complete reality when you press caps lock key, light is blinked only one time to indicate that caps lock is on, it is not turned on till you press the caps lock key again like other keyboard.Because of which it becomes difficult to use MS Word, Excel etc where it is commonly used."
5,Awosme product. I m very happy to get this product
1,"Product box was not sealed, also the box was broken as if it was used previously.Important point is, this product has only one year warranty as per warranty card but seller has mentioned 3 year warranty.Keyboard keys quality is not good, keys are very delicate looks like it can be easily broken. Num lock and caps lock light doesn't remains on when keys are active hence difficult to guess if keys are pressed.Mouse quality is good."
5,"After lot of research I ended up purchasing this combo. Both keyboard and mouse are working seamlessly. Keyboard typing is comfortable. The led indicators on keyboard is tiny though and does not stay lit always, i.e. once activated, it blinks for couple of time and goes away but that's fine, atleast you will get the indicators while most other brand does not have indicators for all options. No lag while typing. Mouse is super smooth. Clicks and scrolls are both very good."
2,"The mouse is working. There is a power problem with the keyboard. Sometimes it is working fine, sometimes not. When not working, I simply rotate the battery in connected position, then it works.Numlock indicator supposed to be lighted continously. When it is pressed, indicator blinks for about five seconds, then go off.Suggest me what to do."
1,"Product looks good,Fast delivery.Keyboard & Mouse paired very fast.Mouse work fine, but Keyboard is not working properly.In Keyboard CAPS & NUM lock LED indicator are not staying, when you press button, LED comes & goes off immediately, due this You cannot know whether CAPS & NUM lock ON/OFF.I returned & replaced the product, still the same issue continues.If this is expected functionality of the Product, then it's very bad product design."
1,"Do not purchase!This is the second set we have got, as in the first set, mouse was faulty. At start, the set worked fine. Next week there was major lag between the Keyboard, the mouse & the receiver. We thought it was the battery so we changed it. It ran fine then again the same problem persists. We thought the battery was bad so we changed it again. But then again the problem persists. I understand i'm out of return policy or refund & don't mind the cost, but the set is bad & shame o n Amazon & Appario to sell me this equipment. Do not purchase!"
3,"Writing a review after using the product for a week.Well, it is great to be honest. Does what it is intended for. The mouse is good. I am very particular about the grip and sensitivity of the mouse. I have used many wireless mouses and not all of them are good. This mouse may well be used for gaming as well (better than average but not exactly comparing with core gaming mouse)They keyboard is a bit of a let down. The range is weak. It loses connectivity if the adapter is not in sight.I am using it on my mac."
5,"I made this purchase 2 years back and only once I replaced battery for keyboard notfor the mouse, by the way I don't use that mouse as my primary mouse and one thing is noticable as I used this keyboard for gaming all the time."
1,"I was expecting a cheap keyboard but not so cheap. Keypads are stiff and typing a sentence can take ages even for experts. It will not last more than year I’m sure if used more than 5-6 hours a day.. keyboard and the keypad is very compact and has nice design .. but what’s the point when one has to struggle to type. I may end up throwing or donating it away to someone. I sincerely request people not to buy this model, spend some more money to save all the money on other product. If one does have too much of work then may think of buying. Quality is very cheap."
5,"The keys are not very plasticky and has a quite a bit of travel as one would prefer from a desk keyboard. The keys are soft and pretty responsive.The mouse on the other hand is a bit too light, which I am not very fond of, but is very responsive and smooth. The buttons provide a good feel and overall the build quality is satisfactory.Coming to the battery life, it’s running for over two months now, without any problems and the claims by Lenovo  on battery are yet to be justified.The keyboard cannot be turned off, there is no switch for that, but the mouse has a switch to turn it off or on. I haven’t turned off any of the devices yet from the time I bought it, and I use it around 9/10 hours everyday with the new work from home norm. The battery is holding up pretty good till now."
5,This product is good and easy to use and lightweight. You can use this product for typing fast and also having a good feeling that we are using on PC. Nive and quality product.
1,"Keyboard misses several signals. Cannot type fast. One has to be very slow. At times, it just hangs and one has to wait several seconds, before continue to type. Sent a message to Lenovo Customer Care, but no response.I have tried on 2 laptops, one being brand new.Laptop is placed just one feet away and receiver is plugged directly into laptop. Tried changing battery also."
1,Keyboard is hard and stiff. Not at all easy to use. Unfortunately this happened a month after purchase I.e. after the window for returning the item has closed so basically there's nothing one can do but grin and bare or throw the keyboard out. Sucks!
1,"Everything was all good, worked well initially, layout, feel, etc. all suited me. BUT then, suddenly I started noticing missing key strokes. I thought it is battery problem, changed its battery to new Duracell Ultra but then also it didn't worked.This problem is making this key board unusable. It is in warranty but don't know whether they will accept this or not plus running to service center during this pandemic time is also not a good option. So, within 1 month my money is wasted and now nothing but an e-waste."
4,Awesome keyboard. Right size. Best thing it has single usb connector for both wireless mouse and keyboard so saving another usb port for other usage.Keys are a litte hard and not very soft but i think it will get soft with usage.Happy with the product. I got it forRs 1190. Review on 1st day. But since it has warranty i m not much worried.
2,"This keyboard results in erratic keystroke capture. It seems to be completely whimsical working perfectly sometimes and not at other times.I sit away from the laptop (about 8 feet away). Did not face this issues with my earlier keyboards.This can be quite irritating when you are typing more to only realise later that letters are missing.The other issue I see is that the Caps lock and num lock light dont stay on.So not sure how this feature helps, especially Caps lock. The light simply blinks and turns off.I started to type this review as the keyboard again gave me a problem with all keystrokes not being captured.Funnily, while I typed this review, it worked flawlessly."
4,"I bought this since i own a Lenovo all in one desktop PC. and the Keyboard and mouse that came with it was broken.1. The build quality is no where near the keyboard/mouse that I got in box (same lenovo brand) with the desktop PC. Having said that the build quality of this mouse/keyboard not that bad either. The keys are ergonomic and good. The mouse keys are good.2. Like many people mentioned in the reviews, the caps lock and num lock indication lights glow and turn OFF and do not stay ON as required. Probably an issue with the hardware.3. Overall its a decent buy."
2,"The keyboard is absolutely fine to type, but doesn't come up with a wrist pad that would be too beneficial to type for continuous long hours without affecting wrist. Moreover, it's un-usable in the nights (without turn-on room lights) becoz doesn't come up with led display. The real problem comes with the mouse. that's absolutely worst, useless, and I totally end up in wrist-pain. Please be careful in purchasing these two items as the return policy appears to be scary."
2,"the keys are hard to use and put a lot of pressure on fingers. They are not made for long use.After a 2-3 months, the ctrl-key got stuck. Then a few more months down the line, i have a case of missing letters.The warranty is not at home and in NCR it is either in Ghaziabad or Delhi.the mouse also started having problems with right click after sometime.Would not recommend it to buy."
3,First delivery did not work properly with some keys on the keyboard not consistently working and erratic mouse movements. Suspect problem was with the Bluetooth dongle that was part of the k/b+mouse kit. Replacement (same make & model) was promptly delivered and works without a problem. Soft-touch keyboard (membrane) takes a short-while to get used to but is OK once familiar with it.
5,"A very good product (keyboard and mouse) in this price range. I found it user friendly. I now use it for my full day work. So far no problems.Suggestion- provide caps lock indicator light near or on the button itself, having it near Num pad does not help much...Escape and other function keys can be bit bigger but not that big dealGiving 4 stars on Ergonomic for Mouse size."
2,"The keys of it is nice. Ergonics is very good. But it is very bad for gaming, when I play video games, the keyboard just disconnects from the computer automatically and then I have to remove the battery and then again put it in the keyboard and then starts to work again. It is so annoying to do this again and again. For gaming very very poor, and for daily use, internet browsing and office, it is average."
5,"Excellent choice of keyboard and mouse for this price, can be used for office and gaming purpose . At first the mouse looks small but the premium feel makes it better, I would say the mouse isn’t the issue ( big palms user ).Used the keyboard for my thing as runs without delay and very smooth, used for gaming (FIFA and Valorant ) very good performance they’re too.Great prod at this price point."
5,Reviewing this after using my first Lenovo 100 for more than 2 years.Now I have purchased it for another laptop.Goodness of keyboard -Full size keyboard.Conventional lay-out with proper space.Smooth buttons.Goodness of mouse -Standard size mouseWith on/off switch.Buttons and roller working so smoothly till day.Long battery life.
2,"The product looks beautiful and sleek. The keys are large and needs a little bit to get used to. My main problem was that there were a lot of missed keystrokes. It's not just when you are typing fast, you have to type really slow to register all keystrokes. I have used a logitech wireless keyboard + mouse combo and faced no such problems. Disappointed in this product as lenovo is a trusted brand. The mouse works great though."
1,"After 6 months of use, 8 times out of 10 the keys are completely unresponsive, changed to new batteries but didn’t help, the keyboard is never more than 6 feet away from the receptor, be it gaming or watchin movies it’s frustrating at times, the left click on the mouse gives away too easily, had to change the settings n now using the right click, no durability or longevity."
4,"It's not for gamers, as it feels a little delicate for that but for someone who has to type a lot. It's not heavy at all, I can take it in my lap and type all day long. Quite easy to use. It's sleek, simple and smart just what I was looking for. A perfect no nonsense keyboard and mouse combo that means business. The only let down that I felt is build quality, it could have been a little stardy, keyboard feels a little fragile apart from that it's maska.... Thanks lenovo, thanks amazon..."
3,"Perhaps due to typing on another keyboard, I am having difficulty typing but I am trying to change my habit of hitting hard on keys. Backspace and enter keys give troubleOtherwise, with light strokes, it works fine. It is a minimalistic design and perhaps the cheapest keyboard mouse combo of Lenovo.I Will take time to comment correctly"
5,"Recommended. However be informed, that the power in the mouse doesn't switch off automatically, when the computer is switched off. Should be manually switched off. Even cheaper mouse, from Portronics, i- Bell switches off automatically if left unused , and starts automatically when booting. Keyboard might have the same defect, but I didn't check that out till now."
2,"Just after 4 months of usage, the keyboard became unresponsive to the keypresses - it just did not recognize the keys being pressed.. So I replaced the battery (i used a fresh DURACELL AAA battery) on the Keyboard and then for about 2 days, it was a little better (though at times it still did not recognize some key presses)..Same issue I faced with the Mouse piece as well.. it became unresponsive after maybe 7 months of usage.. Changing the battery on the mouse piece, it was back to normal..Lesson learnt: stick to the company who has been manufacturing keyboards for a long time now like Logitech or Microsoft or Dell (maybe even HP).."
1,"Item was delivered on Delivered 31-Mar-2021, Return window closed on 07-Apr-2021. Worked great in two weeks, now keyboard is not responding when I press keys. I have to press it multiple time to get response. I can't even return this item, my money is wasted. This is really bad item, didn't expect this from brand like 'Lenovo'. I would recommend you to buy some other keyboard, even mouse performance is below satisfaction level. Buy it at your own risk."
3,"The quality of the product is really nice. The only issue with the product is that the keys have become hard to use and it becomes really annoying if you type fast. You have to keep going back to correct the words.Mouse is very smooth and doing a good job so far.Also, the keyboard is well covered while not in use.."
1,Situation Rport - 1 Month of usage - Cannot go too far away from the dongle - A lot of typed letters missing from output ( This reviw was made with this product...) - Buttons are getting soft and flimsy - Not fun to type!Regrtting the purchase. Assumd that Lenovo would sell reliable and useful products... Apparently NOT! :(
3,"Dissapointed with mouse . The mouse is very small even small than a kid's hand.it has a bend in its design which doesnt allow you to click properly.it tough to take the chip out of mouse,but the keyboard  is  faboulous it has a shine on it's keys ,it's a little bit small but doesnt require much effort to click on keys ,the keys are not popped out as it is in wired keyboards the legs of keyboards also allows it to stand up till 2 cm which is same as wired keyboards(most of the ).. overall mouse is not good and the keyboard is awesome"
4,"I wanted a cost effective keyboard for my second computer and did not want to spend much on a fancy keyboard.At less than 500 bucks this keyboard is a value buy. The keyboard is sturdy, the keys feel is good, does not make much noise. The ergonomics is kinda OK, when you use the flip stand to change /increase the tilt of the keyboard.The special media keys all work with the additional pressing of the 'Fn' key, which might not be pleasing to people who see a lot of multi-media in their computer. The Sleep button is missing in the keyboard, which could have been a useful addition."
5,"Very smooth n slim Checlet PC keyboard, it's value for money, but ₹key don't work/pre-installed.If you require please download this softwares from other sources."
5,super soft and smooth keys...VFM..In this price amazing chicklet keyboard...Thanks to amazon

5,Working good with Google Chromebox.
1,Amazon is selling all duplicate products. My keyboard is not working kindly replace. It has hardly worked for 2 months.
5,"it is working smoothly, i totally like it,"
1,Not good as it seems you can buy it if it's available for rs 50. The key's are very noicey and quite bad quality look
5,"Using since a couple of weeks. Smooth typing, and soft typing sounds. Great ergonomics. Good for coding."
5,Value for money.
5,Nice keyboard. Worth the price.
5,Excellent slim key board
4,Keyboard very smooth and very soft keysGood keyboard
2,Its okay keyboard for this money.
4,Nice keyboard 👍Should be buyValue of money
4,Good product. But key is little bit hard to type.
5,"Really, nice product.....valu for money...."
5,Nice product value of money
5,Good value for money
4,Nice product and value for money.
4,At 1500 rs its worth of money. You can't compare it with high end keyboards but its best in this price range. Customisable buttons are so cool you can creat shortcuts with different memory button but the only thing to notice is you have to do this after every restart o f your pc. Else its amazing light is so cool looks best at night. Breathing is not like other keyboards but its okk fpr this price
5,"Main purpose of use is graphic designing.I am not in gaming at all.Keys are very responsive and very easy on fingers.As a workaholic designer, I recommend this product."
5,Ok i got this keyboard 10hours ago and i totally satisfied with it first of all this is one of the best keyboard i used in this price range.The keys of this keyboard is very responsive  and after playing lot of gta5 in this i can say that the only problem u will face that the placement of the escape (esc) key is little high so i have problems with that. Otherwise no issues while gaming. Rgb is also very good and all key letters are visible without rgb which is awesome. Now i have used the redgear blaze 3 but it have lot of issues like only one color glows at a time and also without rgb or in direct light u cant see the letters in it. I definitely prefer this 👌 keyboard over any other keyboard.

1,not working properly and not response from cstomer spport very bad serviceI send keyboard to service centre but service centre not respond i m sending my keybord within 2months ago but service centre not respond very bad product and company
2,"Toy like keyboad for kids.Low built.RGB is not as shown.Big keyboard with small keys size.Typing with resting wrists on resting part of keyboard is very difficult fingers have to be squeeze too much to use z,x,c.. keys.(low built quality)Can't controll Brightness of screen, Fn keys, keyboard RGB keys of laptop with this keyboard and even can be setup through programmable keys.*******This keyboard give lot of function like RGB keyboard, programmable keys, etc but can't fullfill any criteria 100% sorry even 70%.*******Note: this keyboard once ordered and received it can't be returned only be replaced. Money wasting."
3,"Good product ... But delivery by Amazon was worst, there was not single box cover over the box of keyboard.. also the box was totally wet and damaged from one side .. 0/10 to Amazon shipping."
1,I've placed this order and received my order on 26th April. Today is 27th May 2021 i.e. one month and many of the keys arr not working. There is a one year warranty on this. Let me know how can I claim it.
1,"I brought keyboard on 24th Feb 2021 and now window key is not working, very disappointing product"
2,Although  the product is value for momey . It's degisn is top to the line. It's really impressive but I got the defective model. In mine letter M and letter T are not working even the enter key of numpad is defective. For this i really got disappointed from flipkart 🙃
5,Best part is 15 macro buttons with fully customisable all keyboard keys with software and also with Hot keys. RGB lights make it perfect and design is too good and comfortable for long time.
3,"Product is good but I received a product that was not functioning, lightening is amazing but I am sad."
3,Not so impressed with this budget. Color breathing is too slow and keys are very cheep quality.
2,If u have really tight budget u can go for this keyboardIf u have budget of 1700  u should ignore this and go for quamtum mechanical keyboard it's much better I regret purchasing this membrane keyboard lop
2,"Seal was not proper ,letter C and number 3 in keyboard not in working conditionSo I placed a replacement order,hope I will get a brand new keyboard next time"
3,Recommended for budget gamer and casual gamer but best for office or work usage👍
3,Function key and volume management keys are not installed. Dumb product!!!
5,Excellent in all departments. Exceeded expectations. Matches aesthetically with silver iMac

5,Excellent in all departments. Exceeded expectations. Matches aesthetically with silver iMac
5,good quality and a soft keys
4,Very satisfied with the overall quality and the fit of the product.An issue: The capslock key should have had a hole for the led to pass through. It has a white printed hole which fooled me at first.A suggestion: find a way to make this black print skin cover to be compatible with backlit keyboards and power button integrated fingerprint sensor.
4,"The fit and the quality of the product is overall satisfying and good. Just faced 2 issues, one is with the caps lock led button indication provision is not given and the other is with the power on fingerprint button access is not available as the complete rubber casing covering the whole keyboard"
4,Precise fit for dell 15.6 inch. Good design and material.But diffuses backlight on keys due to black coating. Difficult to type in the dark.
4,Have been using it for a week now. So far so good. One star less because cannot see Caps ON light and fingerprint reader (power button) is fully covered.
5,I took it for my Dell XPS and it fits perfectly and has a smooth grip. It will be for long term and you won't be feel good while typing. Best one to buy. Easy to clean and wash.
5,Excellent except there is no proper provision for touch off/ on button
4,Happy with this keyboard skin. Although it covers the fingerprint scanner but that's a minor issue. Overall it feels soft to the fingers and goes perfectly with my laptop skin color.
3,the quality is good enough. but it didnt fit my laptop model - lenovo 57000
3,Avarage quality
3,The caps lock on light isn't visible through the keypad skin. That makes it difficult to understand if caps lock is on or off. Otherwise it's a good product.
4,Video Player is loading.
4,Worth buying
1,Doesn't fit good.

3,"Your Questions Answered :Did you reach here because you love Mechanical keyboards? - This won't make you happy, travel between the keys is less, and accidental key tap can happen Often.Did you reach here because of the backlight keyboard? - This is not for you, wont justify why it's not for you. the backlight situation is BAD.Did you reach here because you are a gamer and you like the way it looks? - Just run from this product, it's not for you nerd..So who is it for?For someone who likes, - Big keyboard cable, - Bad backlight, - OK typing experience.More Reasons to stay away.. - For some reason, the keys are multi-colored, yes it's not RGB, the letters through which the ""white"" light is seen is colored. - The Cable is huge and it takes away the look of your desk. - The backlight is soooo dim. the images are from a totally dark environment, yes it looks all good in pitch dark. but usually, you have a bright monitor in front of the keyboard. and this keyboard is so dim that it looks as if it's about to die.Overall:Usable but Wouldnt recommend.."
4,"Packaging:1. When I reached the main keyboard box, they had reused the hp logo sticker to close the box. While other straps of both sides were not even intact within the place. It was very clear that the box had been opened before.2. When I reached for the keyboard, the keys had lots of dust particles on in.Product:1.The keyboard is great for gaming purposes I guess because I bought it for typing purposes.2. Other than that, everything works great, the RGB is a lot enough and the keyboard looks super cool. The wire is thick and the USB is also of great quality.3. Overall, the keyboard is perfect!"
1,"- It's not ergonomic in terms of usage.- They keypress is pretty fast. That's about here the good parts end- LED Lighting is more of a fancy piece. Bright lighting and accessibility goes out of the window- To add to after 3 months, the keyboard has stopped working. Complete waste of money"
5,"Arrived in record time.  Very good quality keyboard, and the keys have a nice mechanical feel to them. The material also is quality stuff, and this is a good keyboard for gaming, typing or programming as well, as the pressing action is really smooth.Although not recommended for older people as the letters are very faint, and the backlight is quite dim. Overall a good keyboard for casual gamers and for regular use as well!"
3,"My personal review:-Pros:1. The keys are smooth.2. The touch is premium for the money.3. Feels good to type on it after a little practice.Cons:1. The keys are comparatively small. I had to do a little practice in order to type perfectly with this keyboard since the keys are comparatively smaller than the other generic keyboards and closely packed.2. The backlit in this keyboard is dim, not customizable to your favourite colour and the fact that the keys are individually not painted in white texts, it becomes difficult to type with it when you are typing in a well-lit room."
1,"Just like a regular keyboard, backlight is not that impressive and not bright at all under Rs. 899 price tag. It is just the name ""Gaming Keyboard"" but there is nothing compare to the other available LED boards which are much impressive under this price."
4,"The HP K300 model keyboard is said to be a gaming keyboard, whereas it's not. IT IS NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FIRST OF ALL. The click feel of this keyboard lies between a normal keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. All I can say is that, if you're purpose is completely based on gaming, do not go for this k300. This is a 25% mechanical and 75% normal keyboard. The only thing which i liked about this product is that the build quality is good.PROS: 1) Good built2) Average click feel3) Has height adjustable stands.4) Good cable and USB INPUT quality.5) Has good cable length.6) Keys are slightly taller from the base which does not hurt while using it for a long time.CONS: 1) Very poor backlit2) The RGB can't be customized.3) No surround RGB.4) Not good to carry around as it's heavier than other keyboards.5) Lock Keys Light is very cheap."
4,"This is for the people who are trying to get a good keyboard but a on budget, people who are also looking to get RGB or get a feeling of mechanical keyboard they can get this model. It does not have any bright RGB lighting it is just namesake. It has a  good build quality, cables are thick, Key strokes are deep to get a better feedback. It has 3 modes to change and it works on Mac and Android also. there is a feature to disable windows accidental keypress in games you can turn it off or on."
2,Poor lights and the keys are very close to each other. The space bar misses hits at times.You will always end up with lot of typos because of the close proximity of the key. HP Gaming Keyboard K500F is a better one.Happy shopping !
4,"The keyboard looks wellbuild..however durability mostly depends on luck; could work for just a couple of weeks or may serve me for years to come...BUT for what it's worth its awesome..I don't quite get why everyone is complaining about the backlight, Yes, it's PERFECTLY READABLY dim (exactly how I would set backlight brightness settings if I was given an option)...keys are comfortable and punchy to type and doesn't skip..no ghosting issues"
5,"A good keyboard is very important for any user. Ive  realized this after i made this purchase. Earlier i used more generic keyboards but this one, for its price, is a game changer. I totally love typing on this keyboard and will suggest this particular keyboard to everyone. For its price you cannot ask for more."
3,"Everything about this keyboard is good , the ergonomics , the feel and feedback ..but the brightness is too low ..can’t see properly when the room lights are on"
4,"Everything is good.  The feel while typing is great. The travel distance is good. The keyboard is slightly small in width which is a small problem for those whose hands are big like me. The keys don't repeat them, I mean they are accurate. The anti-ghosting feature works well while gaming. Overall it is a decent purchase. Just one little thing to consider is that it's backlight is very very dim. In the daylight conditions, we can see and type, in total darkness, the brightness of keys are enough but the problem comes when we need to type in the evening time, the key prints are invisible(doesn't matter whether the backlighting is off or on). This problem only happens in evening time, other than that, it is great keyboard."
1,"Don't be fooled by the marketing images. Can't change the keyboard light colour to one specific. Brightness is too poor. Without backlight enabled you won't be able to see any key markings clearly. Typing experience is average and nothing much to expect for the price it's being offered.  Can't see keys if there's bright light in front of you, for ex monitor or a well lit room."
1,1) The box was already opened. Seems to be they delivered somebody's returned product.2) Keyboard having scratches.3) Oneside height adjustment clip missing.4) RGB not working.5) Where is HPs protective cover inside the box?Please do a quality check before delivering the product.
4,"The keyboard is pretty amazing for its price but I did notice some rocking while typing which shows it wasn't manufactured right. It just passed the bar for gaming and isn't anything special. No mechanical sound or feel but is better than regular keyboards. I suggest going for cosmicbyte at the same prices for better value. The look is definitely very sleek and minimalistic which is good. The RGB on the other hand sucks, so if ur a big fan of RGB don't buy it. Very old hp product so it's expected but overall ok for its price. I mean it's only 1000."
3,"Key strokes are smooth, sturdy keyboard but bad keyboard base grip and bad key back light. Relied on the bright key board light picture in the product order page and got cheated. Wanted refund but option was available only for replacement. Returned the product and promptly received a replacement which also had very poor backlight. Looks like by design the product has very low back light. Not what I wanted or expected."
5,"Is it me or are the keys a little smaller in width? The key click sounds just like any other membrane keyboard. Surely looks mechanical but not. Lights are exactly like in the pictures. Has breathing mode but the colours don't change around. Overall, not bad."
4,The problem with gaming hardware is that Little things can impact a lot. I didn't like the key typings and the backlight. The backlight is just too low to be allowing someone to play in dark. The key presses don't look comfortable to me a lot. This might vary person to person but do expect a lot more from HP.
5,"1. Built quality superb.2. Keys designs help more to type accurately.3. Weight is also heavy, better than cheap-feeling metal lite keyboards at this price.4. Sounds good too.5. Wire is also bigger and thicker. 😛Only the backlit could be more, but it suits perfectly as Minimal.It was the best buy for me.And Amazon delivery was awesome too for the fastest delivery within 16 hours."
3,Keyboard looks is good specially for gamers but if you are looking for mechanical keyboard or your work mostly based on typing then don't buy this.. first reason is the keys location is not in the right place there are large gaps between keys and you have to set your hand according to this keyboard structure.. and second reason this is not a mechanical keyboard as they are showing in the banner this is membrane keyboard which is not good enough for typist.. I'm giving 3 stars because of 3 reason 1. looks 2. LED light 3. I got this at rs. 825 and there is nothing good in this keyboard..
4,The buttons are absolutely not visible. Backlight is too dull. And I am not exaggerating because I needed a keyboard with not so fancy/bright backlight. This one is okayish I would say. But still the backlight is pretty damn low.
5,"I don't write reviews of products generally. But this one, I felt I should write, because I liked how it feels while typing. I type a lot and often, but never tried a gaming keyboard. After trying this keyboard for a few mins, I felt I discovered this keyboard very late.  The make is tough, the backlight is uber cool. There seems to be no doubt that this will last."
5,I choose this cuz I didn't want too fancy looking full RGB aesthetic sorta looking keyboard which the market is dominated with.The board is pretty good though I feel sometimes that the light on keys Could've been a lil more brighter I suppose. But problemo for me.
2,"No ergonomics in this board, key heights are unnecessarily high, left shift key and enter key began squeaking after 11 days of use and the spacebar key has a weird flex to it, athe backlighting is stupid dim. The keys are not printed properly you won't be able to see them even in daylight. Also the worst input lag I've experienced till now of all membrane keyboards."
1,"Most of the keys are giving two output like m/n is giving mn, b/v is giving bv etc. Not at all recommend. I would have given this a negative rating. Total waste of money. Seller also didn't reply to my message. I will never buy from this seller. They sell defective piece."
4,"A very good product, anyone can choose this keyboard for its performance and price, make sure you receive a good product without damage as it can happen due to online shopping, backlight I would say decent enough coz u must understand that a product from reputed company comes out with several plans and ideas behind,so one cannot put all the best in a single product that too for low price,don't miss this price offer, good product to be honest with decent backlight XD"
4,The keyboard is perfect for me aslo looks like the expensive mechanical keyboard. although it is not mechanical but the keys are raised enough... the only thing that bothed me was the compact design. I used to use a standard sized keyboard and shifting to this reduced my speed. also the space bar should be a bit heighted as the other keys hide it and it was difficult to reach for the space bar with my thumb
3,"Good quality, no defects as expected but the backlight is just nothing more than a gimic. It is so dull you have to wait till night turn off all the lights and then you'll notice that it has RGB and even worse is you cannot use it without turning on the RGB cause the letter markings are also very dull. overall if you know to type or know your layout and in a very tight budget sure go for it else I would suggest looking at other bit up tier keyboards."
1,Guys Keyboard is a basic. Led lights on keys are dim even with full brightness. You can strangle to see the keys in darkness. Platform below keys has led. In the Product Ad they have shown bright Led patch that's misleading. It has dimmest led lights trust me. Don't go for it if you are going for Led effects.
4,this keyboard is very well its a good mechanical keyboard at this price range that to from a branded companybut the sad thing is you dont get any option to change the lights or any mods which can change the type the lights are present . this keybpard is for the people who want a cheap mechanical keybpard from a branded company with warranty . and you just gget a option to adjust the brightness of the lights present . thats ityou can go for it . the packaging was good
1,Keys are not perfectly fir in coverCover are little big Not fit in my hp pavilion eg0103tx its big and too costly saco should be carefull becasue at that price point there is no place for mistake
5,"This skin is provides perfect protection and nice look for my laptop,"
5,Product is perfect for my hp pavilion 15.Go for it.
5,Very good product..Exact fit . Really happy with the product.
5,"I have been looking for a portable keyboard that I could carry around with my ageing MiPad tablet so that I could type papers on the go at coffee shops or in the library without having to lug around the weight of a full sized laptop. My search began with many brands that I saw tech reviewers showcased most of which were way too expensive or not even available in India. I narrowed down to a few Logitech keyboards and I am of the opinion that Logitech makes some of the best PC accessories. The K480, K380, and the newer K375s were the ones I had my eyes on.Build Quality:It is build really well although it is made of plastic, there is nothing to worry about the build. If you have held the K480, it is pretty much the same build, and not very different from the K375s. It seems it can take some rough usage, in my opinion. (Disclaimer: This does not mean you don't take care of the device at all.) The construction of the keyboard is solid.Battery life:I haven't had the keyboard long enough to give my personal opinion on it, but the reviews online do say that it lasts for months and I don't see a reason to disagree. It takes two AAA batteries to be powered which is easily user replaceable when the batteries they come with are depleted. I'd like to see a micro-USB charger with built in batteries for the next iteration of this keyboard as this is my only gripe with it.Form Factor:The K380 is by far the smallest and the most portable of the lot. A more comparable one in terms of form factor would be the K810 which is priced substantially higher than the ones mentioned earlier. The K480 and K375s are decent alternatives to this keyboard if portability isn't your first priority. The K480 has a built-in cradle to hold your device which was tempting to me, but I preferred the portability of the K380. The K375s has a full num-pad too, so it is the least portable of the lot which is not to say that it is not portable. It is quite portable too. So choose what functionality you'd like and pick the one that suits you.Typing Experience:The keys of the K380 are round as can be seen from the pictures which may seem odd to some since most keyboards have square keys. This is probably an attempt by Lenovo to make it look retro which may be off-putting to some. Aesthetics is not something I am going to share my opinion on, but I can say that the keys are almost as comfortable as the ones on the MacBook Air which is saying a lot since MacBooks are like the gold standard when it comes to keyboards. The round keys do not in any way hinder the typing experience, it remains the same as on normal keyboards if not better. The key travel is also tactile and not shallow which provides for a better typing experience. All in all, the typing experience is as good as on the MacBook Air, maybe even better.Compatibility/Connectivity:The connectivity is really good. It is compatible across all devices in the mainstream market including Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. If you are worried about compatibility, don't. You'll be just fine. The pairing process is as simple as pressing on of the yellow buttons on the top left. You can pair upto 3 devices at a time and switch seamlessly between them (this is a feature that exists in the K480 and K375s as well). This is one of the USPs of the keyboard. In a scenario where you have to type on multiple devices, this is a blessing to have. Take for instance, I could type this review on my laptop while I have my paper open on the tablet which I have to type too, and moreover I could reply to my texts on the phone without having to move my hands away from the keyboard as long as I have all of them paired up. Switching to devices is as simple as pressing on the corresponding yellow button on the top left of the keyboard.Pricing:Having read the review, if you are convinced you want one. The pricing could be another factor that helps you decide. I got the laptop for ~1200 which is a steal and as low as I've seen the price drop, so if that's the price you are seeing right now, I'd ask you to go for it without any hesitation. But if the price is ~1500, you can take your time to deliberate upon your decision. If it is around ~2000, please wait for the prices to fall.For the price range of ~1500, this is the best portable keyboard, hands down.Please do hit the ""helpful"" button if this helped."
5,"It’s very good looks wise & also buttons are round shaped. Typing is not great but it’s good enough. You can connect 3 diff devices seamlessly with just the press of a button. Light weight. I’m using it for my mobile, IPad & laptop as well. Works smoothly with all the devices. Bit a pricey, but u can get it at low price in lighting deals or festive sales. Go for it & you won’t regret. Thank you. If you find this review helpful plz appreciate it by liking the review. -Sri Tech Guy."
3,Connects very easily and functions very well with very low power consumption. It is also remarkably quiet and can be used in crowded environments without disturbing others. However:1) It is remarkably heavy.2) The keys have very little play and so you tend to miss keys if you are not very careful.3) The four friction studs on the bottom are fixed with an adhesive that runs and oozes even at ambient temperatures of ~ 30 degrees. I have to soak up the runny glue with powder almost on a daily basis.4) Too small for comfortable and fast two-handed typing.
5,"I waited for this particular keyboard for about 6 months to be available in Blue Colour. The price in which I got is 3054/-.. So, I'll judge it by this price (if you can get it in cheaper price, even better).So,,, coming to pros and cons:Pros:1. Very very soothing experience to type on a rounded key. First I thought that I won't even like it that much, but now I love it.2. The key sounds are really quiet. Won't bother your roommate while late night essay writing or when in a library. But the sound of the keys are unique - more like a chicklet sound.3. The support for iOS, MacOS, Windows and Android is great. The dedicated 3 buttons on top lets you switch between three devices instantly (time delay while  switching next is about 3-4 seconds.)4. iOS keys are working flawlessly. Home button, screenshot etc..Now, the CONS:1. The keys are a little bit on harder side, not for touch typing like macbooks.2. Caps lock has no lights. So, you never know when you accidentally pressed Caps lock.3. Problem in connecting with Linux OS - Lubuntu. Couldn't even fix it.4. The left and right arrow keys could have been full size as it has enough space. But they put smaller keys anyway.5. Warranty 1 year only. Logitech usually gives 2-3 years of warranty. But considering it a premium keyboard they should have given 2 years warranty at least.The Cons are not much of a deal breaker. So, if you want it for iPad/Laprop/any other device except Linux, then go fot it. No problems at all."
5,"This is one of the best wireless keyboard out there with the fabulous easy pairing and switching between Windows and Mac devices.This is light weight, small, compact and slim. Just the way i needed my keyboard to be.Its battery operated and hence works with 2 AA batteries which i have not changed in a month since i bought it. So i am assuming it will last for another atleast 4-5 months.It can pair with 3 different devices at the same time and the pairing is just so easy. In my opinion this one is better than K 480 which is heavy and bulky. Not the one for me. The body is made of plastic which is still sturdy and does not feel cheap and flimsy. Obviously you can’t compare it with Apple Keyboard as its aluminium made bu then if you are ready to shell out 10k for it, well go for it. I bought this Logi for 2895 which is a great price keeping in mind the build quality and usage of this keyboard."
3,"Pros:1. Very easy pairing and switching between devices2. Compact, easy to carry and the pink colour looks better in person than in pictures.3. Matte finish.4. Least amount of noise while typing.Cons (According to my personal taste)1. Coming from the 2013 Macbook Air model, the keys are inferior:  a. The feeling of keys is not smooth but rough. Not made with the material which feels good to touch.  b. The Command, Option, Ctrl, Space and Arrow keys are of bumped up shape (concave but protruding outwards) rather than concave having depth like other keys.  c. You have to apply more weight and force to type. They are not soft like that of MacbookAir's.2. Ctrl and Fn keys have replaced positions. Fn (which is useless) is closer to the Option key instead of Ctrl3. NOT a backlit keyboard! (Biggest Con)Conclusion:Overall disappointed. The typing experience is average. Quite lower than the experience you get on older generation macs.Buy if: Looking for a portable, easy wireless keyboard for connecting with any devices.DO NOT Buy If: You are planning to increase the typing experience from your Macs while having the benefits of being wireless."
5,"K380 is an older model from Logitech, but it still handily beats the newer models from this company or its competitors. Couple things that were important considerations for me:—Size: As you know, this is “compact” which means the keyboard is designed to take up as little space as possible. For this reason, I was hesitant while ordering because I didn’t want to be cramped while typing. I have an ancient Logitech full size keyboard (wired), and I wanted the type-feel to be similar with any new wireless one I buy. But guess what, K380 is better: surprisingly, the dimensions of the actual alphabet key console is nearly identical to the full size one. Meaning, all parts of the full size that I almost never use—the side num panel for example—are gone in this one. In other words, it’s “compact” not because they’ve compromised on essential space, but because K380 gets rid of non-essential stuff (as I’m not an accountant or work in a bank, I really need only need a keyboard to write things—so every key I need and use is included: alphabets, top row of num keys & special symbols, no more, no less).—Color: I’d have normally picked a darker shade, but the only color in stock was the rose. I thought twice about this, because the pictures show a somewhat louder shade of rose than I was willing to go for. But in actuality the shade is so subdued that I think I prefer this over the other options, in stock or out of stock.Bonus: the circular shape of the keys reminds me of a vintage typewriter, which I also liked."
5,"One Hell of an experience using LOGITECH KEYBOARD & LOGITECH PEBBLE MOUSE.Turned my IPad 6th Gen 128 gb into a beast LAPTOP lite.Coupled with APPLE PENCIL,the productivity has gone up by a notch.Ideal for students,medicos,bloggers .Touch sensitivity of mouse is brilliant.The keyboard is one of the best I have ever seen or used.& the look and feel is brilliant.I recommend every IPad users to buy these two.10/10"
5,"I don't know if anyone else has got such a keyboard, but The keyboard on the back has a sticker that it has been approved by Pakistan Telecom Authority. I don't know why this keyboard is here in India in that case. I am replacing it and will update if my 2nd keyboard also has the same issue. Does anybody else have this sticker??Update! : I requested a replacement. But the 2nd one unfortunately had scratches so I had to return it. It still had the PTA sticker on back. Maybe Logitech is putting stickers on all devices.Update 2: This is my third purchase from Amazon, and thankfully the keyboard was in perfect sealed condition with no scratches whatsoever. However, the initial sticker (mentioned in photo) was there. I guess they just stick it to all units. So in case you receive a keyboard with such a sticker you can keep the device. So far the keyboard is working great. I can switch seamlessly between my mobile and MacBook for typing. The keys are very comfortable to type on, and very nice. I programmed the brightness up and down using the Logitech Options software. I am loving this keyboard! Thanks Amazon. Also thanks Amazon to the lightening quick refund for my previous unit."
5,"This is an amazing keyboard. I had recently got a 4k Monitor for my Macbook Air 2015. It supports is quite well in the clamshell mode (when the native LCD screen of the macbook air is turned off and only 4k display is being driven via Displayport)... However to work in clamshell mode, we need an external mouse and keyboard. I tried the wired alternatives and the wireless ones with dongles and they take up all the available ports. I cannot connect my audio interface if all USB ports are occupied just for mouse and keyboard. So I decided to get this keyboard and Logotech M557 mouse.This is an amazingly well built mouse. It weighs a respectable 500grams (feels well built from the inside but the outer shell is plastic).Pros:1. The key travel is better than the keyboard on macbook air.2. The keys have stronger feedback and weight to them.3. Keys are almost the same size as the Macbook Air.4. You can wake Macbook Air with this keyboard or the mouse.5. All function shortcuts work perfectly, media buttons, volume, app expose etc.6. There's absolutely no lag in the keystrokes and my typing speed seems to have improved (Attached image). My average speed used to be 75 to 80. With this keyboard, it's gone up above 80. Loving this keyboard and the feedback on key strokes.7. Easy pairing.Cons:1. It could've been a little wider.2. Could've been made of metal (But that's just whishful thinking). For the price of 1600. I believe it's a very good investment in keyboard.3. The arrow keys could've been bigger (but we don't use those as often).4. Caps lock could've had led indicator.5. Missing Home, Pageup, Page down keys (But they're also missing on Macbook air's keyboard)Overall, it's an excellent purchase for 1600. I saw that this was being sold a year or 2 ago for around 1200, I could've bought it then, but even at 1600 I think it's worth the price.Perfect swiss quality from logitech.Update: 24/3/2018My highest achieved speed on this keyboard is 121 wpm. (refer to screenshot). I can't believe that this bluetooth keyboard can compete with some of the best wireless mechanical keyboards out there."
5,"So I bought the Logitech k480 before getting this one.The device was great, rugged, but weighed more and was less portable.I already have a Logitech Pebble mouse so the only logical thing to do was return the device and get K380.I got it today, and so far I really like this keyboard.My purposes to solve are designing, programming, and basic gaming.This device solves all of them and with grace with the added advantage of being portable much.The only hiccup I have so far is getting used to the smol keys.To which I am certain I will get conscious soon.Thanks."
5,"This replaced a 10 years old Apple Wireless Keyboard and the transition has been super smooth and lovely.The keyboard feels very well-weighted - neither too light and not at all heavy. The four non-slip thin bushes at the corners are gripping the table beautifully - the keyboard won’t slide around at all.Next - the typing feel - BEAUTIFUL and butter smooth. Keystrokes are super quiet, like they are damped or something. The key travel is pleasurable and very comfortable. There is enough feedback from the keys and they are not stubborn when pressed nor are they too light or too springy - great calibration. There is a comfortable slant built into the shape of the keyboard without the need for foldable legs.The circular keys are well-sized and spaced. The keys have a very slight inward dip which I believe is contributing heavily to the typing comfort and joy.The major reasons to pick K380 over K480 (older, slightly less expensive) were the smaller size, lesser weight and overall better design for my liking. And also the fact that even though the K480 has the dock/slot to keep tablets or phones, which is indeed a smart feature, most tablets will be used with protective covers which may not fit into that slot and also most covers or cases support magnetic or other “standing” features anyways.Connectivity - easy, straightforward Bluetooth pairing. Can “remember” 3 devices at any given time (can be “connected” to only 1 device at a time though) and can switch between them instantly with the press of the dedicated three coloured keys at the top. The switching is implemented beautifully - takes only 1 second and maybe a few milliseconds to switch between the paired devices. There are tiny indicator lights above the three bluetooth device switching keys which light up for a few seconds when connected to a device and as a nice touch, they go out with a fade-out/theatre dimming effect! Little details.Design - it’s sleek and beautiful. Perfect blend of playful and serious. Dark Grey colour looks very good.It’s almost the same size as the Apple Wireless Keyboard.1 thing to note - when connected to MacBook Pro, you don’t get to adjust screen brightness using the keyboard as those keys are marked for Bluetooth device switching. But you can adjust volume, music controls and mission control from the keyboard just like on Apple keyboard. This is not at all a major issue.The physical on off slide switch is good. Auto sleep/power off feature avoids the need to use the on off switch daily.Overall, thoroughly satisfied and even delighted with the keyboard. Grateful for Logitech to be making excellent products at great value price points.Using an external keyboard and mouse, along with a raised stand for the laptop can VASTLY improve the experience of regularly working on laptops without the need to think of desktops. Best of all worlds."
5,"My initial impressions were that the keys are too small (still getting used to it). But it's a great keyboard. As you keep using, you get used to the new size and shape of the keys. Doesn't take too long to get used to it.I really enjoy using it along with my MX Master mouse. Initially I didn't know there was the option to link a device with the Logitech Flow so I'd keep typing into the wrong screen and send by mistake send messages to random people because I'd be in a hurry to push enter before I realise what I'm doing. So beware if you have multiple computers in front of you. Though linked along with the flow feature of the mouse, it's beautiful. Almost always I know that if my mouse is on one screen, the keyboard is connected there as well.I just wish I could've bought it slightly cheaper and also if I could customise more of the function keys to mimic what the laptop has easily. eg: I haven't been able to find the brightness up/down customisation on Windows (weirdly it's available on the Mac).Despite whatever downsides, I really love my easily accessible and somewhat ergonomic desktop setup with this keyboard."
3,I've been using the product for my everyday work for the post 5-6 months and I consider it an average performer for the below reasons:1. Battery Drainer - There arises a need to replace the batteries every month as it is power heavy. (Use Duracell as it seems to last longer)2. Subject to frequent disconnections - Gets disconnected from pairing eveytime and I have to toggle the power switch everytime to get it paired it with my pc.3. Bad placement of power switch - At times I forget to switch off the keyboard after work (and it drains battery) as the switch is placed on the side and away from my angle of perception.
5,"This is a brilliant keyboard. The build quality, the design are top notch. The size is very comparable to the size of my Dell XPS 15 keyboard, which is a nice thing. The keyboard feels heavy which is again good because while typing the keyboard stays in place - the rubber feet are also soft and grippy which couple with the weight works very well.The typing experience on round keys is bit different. You need to get used to it. I took 2-3days to get comfortable. Once you get comfortable, its a breeze to use.It shifts connectivity to various devices from a tap of a button in under 3 seconds.I bought it for ₹ 2499, otherwise its sold at a premium because its in huge demand. If you are eying for it and is within 3K range, just buy it.Otherwise I was looking at the Thinkpad trackpoint Keyboard II which is even more better, but currently not available in India."
3,"UPDATE: My keyboard started giving trouble just about after one year use. Some keys would print multiple times on screen even with single press... The Bluetooth connection would switch to drive 1 randomly while I am using it connected to device 3.The worst issue that made me give up on this keyboard is when it started muting my computer randomly. With conference calls and videos all day, this was a disaster.I took it to the service center and it wasn't being accepted out of warranty.  For the price paid, I would suggest to buy only if you get 3 year warranty... Otherwise don't fall for the looks and convenience like I did.Also, open the battery compartment and check if the screws are intact... While giving at service center, I was told that the screws were missing. Obviously I didn't open it.. So for whatever mysterious reasons it must have come without those screws. Was it a refurbished one that I was sold as new:0 ????----–---_-------The biggest strength of this model keyboard is its sturdy build and compactness. Sure you can appreciate it for the premium paid but it should serve the purpose of us built for. As a keyboard it is just average... I tend to miss a few key strokes while typing on it. Missing End,Home,PgUp/Down is a disappointment as I realised how important they are only when I started using this keyboard without those keys. Also the keys are a notch small and cramped... Well it's a compact keyboard, what else to expect.Connection to laptop, mobile on Bluetooth is really fast and doesn't miss a stroke.This keyboard is ideal for those who care too much about a good looking keyboard in their desk and have just few typing needs. Like... to type login, forms, search phrases while browsing etc.For those who got to get productive work done with lot of typing etc. Avoid this one. The design is not meant for heavy usage."
5,"PROS:1. Let size not fool you! It's a full fledged keyboard in a very compact layout. Perfect for ipad or android tablet users and people who type on the go.2. There's very little flex and the keyboard is well built.3. It's silent enough to be used inside a quiet library4. You can easily switch between 3 devices.5. The typing experience is satisfying. The round keys are ergonomic and have good travel.CON:1. The keyboard isn't backlit. And at this price point I wouldn't expect the same.MY TAKE: I had the option to choose between the k480 and k380. The k480 is heavier with a cradle to hold the device and it's not very portable. Since i use a foldable cover which can make the ipad stand in landscape mode, I wouldn't need one. So I went for the lighter and sleeker k380. No complaints so far, it's working as expected."
5,"I had doubts in my mind before buying this keyboard but after bought this it is so good that I have bought another keyboard. Here are my pros and cons for this keyboard.PROS:Portable and easy to carryThough it is small in size. It is perfect for typing.Good for programming and typing documents.I use it for approx. 9 hours a day.It can connect up to 3 Bluetooth devices.Seamless connectivity.Low or no noise. It is a silent keyboard like a pebble mouse.Cons:No dedicated home, End Print screen button. If you have used mac laptops then it will not be a problem. You will get used to it. You need to use Fn + Arrow keys for home, end and Fn + tab for screen shot. For windows users you will get used to it in a day.No Fn lock button. You need to use Fn key to use F1 to F12 keys. Esc + Fn will not switch the fn keys lock but it can be remapped using logitech software. The problem is if you are using it in your professional machine then you cant install the 3rd software unless your admin alows it.Other than this it is a very good keyboard for typing and I would recommend it for content creators or programmers or casual typers. This is not the keyboard for gamers ."
5,"Good build quality, minimalist, almost half the weight of K480. Comfortable and ergonomic even for big hands and finger.The only thing weird is the stamp of approval by Pakistan after manufacturing in China."
1,"1. This is Pakistan Telecom Authority spyware.2. Due to bluetooth failure, we may have to type same key multiple time and it's frustrating.3. Bluetooth auto connect is not working."
4,"For low to medium use, and if one of your priority is looks, than there is no better option than k380.I am going to use it as my companion for surface pro whose keyboard stopped working. I am barely going to use it as I don't use surface as primary device.Regarding keyboardBuild guality : 5/5Nice key travel, Matt finish, I hate glossy plastic cheap products so this is very likable.Weight and size: ideal if you are going to use it with Laptop or tablet. I don't like full size keyboard they are bulky and ugly. K380 is nice and small but have some heft so it doesn't wobble while typing.Looks: I had already decided I was going to buy this no matter what because this is one of the best looking keyboard in under 3k. So go for itPrice: I know people have grabbed this in less than 1500, but I couldn't wait for the deal. I purchased in full price of 2900, but still I am fine with that. It's worth the price tag.Verdict : Very nice keyboard for low to medium use. Not for programmes or documents creation regular work."
5,"Works as advertised, easy to use.pros:1. compact design.2. build quality is top-notch, its feels really sturdy.3. keypresses are satisfyingly tactile and key travel is very good.4. for a compact keyboard the ergonomics are surprisingly very good and I didn't have very little mistypes.5. great alternative for a mac keyboard.cons:1. I expected the keyboard to be a bit lighter for its size.2. Doesn't have backlight.3. doesn't have indicators for caps lock other buttons."
5,"This keyboard is super small and compact. This does not take up much space on your work desk and can be easily carried at anyplace you go.The Connectivity is super easy and quick. You just need to setup devices once and you are good to go. There is button to turn it ON/OFF making it easy to save battery.The color , buttons and aesthetics of the keyboard is very chic and gives a fresh look to the keyboard.It might not be suited for people looking for ergonomic comfort.Overall I am in love with this compact keyboard. It gives a good vibe to my current work from home setup."
5,"Logitech K380 is one of the best wireless keyboards that I have used. Very ergonomic, light weight, compact and portable. It has a very slim profile and is very easy to carry if required to be carried in backpack or carry bag. It has multi device connectivity and can be connected with upto 3 different devices at the same time. I have made an unboxing video of this keyboard on my youtube channel - Unbox Daily Tech. You can perfectly pair this keyboard with the Logitech M337 mouse to make it an amazing set as the colour combination matches exactly.Go for it without any doubts. Best part is it works across devices with different platforms like Windows, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android phones etc. It also gets detected as an apple keyboard and apple mouse on Macs which is really amazing."
4,"Given the current scenario, I have started using my old desktop a lot more for WFH than I used to.The keyboard it had was an ageing K480 which was proving to be a little unergonomic and they keys had started to get a little bit sticky.Having heard a lot about how mechanical keyboard are suposed to the next best thing after sliced bread, i decided to get a HP mechanical with blue switches.As nice as the tactile feel of the mechanical was, I soon realized it was not for me as I would make one too many typos while using it.This keyboard was rated as one of the best picks by rtings and wirecutter - I took a gamble on it expecting it to be very similar to the K480.Was I wrong and how - this thing is a lot smaller and lighter.More importantly , the keys have a much nicer short throw and feel - and while it may not feel as nice to type on vs the HP mechanical, my typing speed and accuracy are far better on this..If you do not need a number pad and would prefer a small KB, don't look any further"
2,"The first impression on seeing the keyboard is that it is tiny. It is barely bigger than my palm. That means uncomfortable typing with all keys very close to each other. I pride myself to never look at the keyboard while typing. But with this keyboard, I had to keep looking at the keys often, and make too many typos if I don't read what I am typing. This is coming from someone whose typing speed is >90 wpm for more than a decade.Keeping aside the size, bluetooth too seem to have issues. I am using this with my mac. Whenever the connection is disconnected, typically when my macbook goes to sleep, I had to manually go to the bluetooth settings on my macbook to reconnect. It rarely reconnects on its own. So much for giving dedicated buttons for connecting automatically.Coming to the pros, this looks cute with its tiny size, and is also super portable. Some people might prefer that aspect.I am not sure what the supposed usecase for this keyboard is, but if you are looking at it as a dedicated keyboard while working, this is a poor choice. Go for something bigger."
5,"This keyboard is really great when it comes to portability and multi-device support. The keys are good and the build quality is also amazing. This is a great product for those looking to have a complete wireless setup. Battery life is also great as is the case with most logitech keyboards and mouse. You can literally leave it always on and still have lot of batery left. Comes with 2 AAA batteries which is good. The Rose gold colour is close to the color of the iPAD hence it matches my overall theme too.......Really happy with the product.......Nothing like this in this price range.PROS - Great connectivity for multiple devices - Connects like magic and switches between my iPAD and windows laptop - Able to connect keyboard mouse and headphone all together with my laptop or iPAD so this helps in having a complete wireless setup for eveything. (I also didnt' think it might work. but it worked) - Really slim and quite keypresses no tatcial sound. key travel is little less than average windows laptop but better than any macbook 😋CONS - not that great for ergonomics, specially it has no adjustable tilt. hence you only get one typing angle. tho you can easily make some adjusts on your own to get an angle of choice."
2,"I am not gonna right lengthy review but must say ,Well, keyboard is pretty Nice in terms of look and feel , portability and of-course compact. People who are gonna buy , they will know that know nums key are there so no negative review on it.The only Cons i see that with the spacebar which is that you gotta press almost in middle to put the space bar, which may quite annoying specially when you are programming are typing very fast.and yes Battery is no where gonna last for 2 years as I am using is since last 7days and its already 95 %. I do have  Logitech M590 having single aa battery but It is still at 100% though i am using sincelast 2 month which is awesome.P.S : I dont see no wireless/bluetooth keyboard in the world that has RGB back-light : D , so no negative review for the sameUpdate: This keyboard really has space issue, do not recommend for pragrammer or for heavy use."
5,"I bought this product a few weeks back. I was looking for a wireless keypad with dimensions similar to the laptop keypad and with keys as light and responsive as the ones you get on high-end laptops. I've absolutely satisfied with the product and it meeting my expectations. In terms of weight, it is slightly heavier as compared to the plastic keypads from other brands, but I don't mind it since I use it for home office purposes and not for travel. The build quality is absolutely top-class, key-travel is very less and the round-shaped keys are gorgeous to look at and easy to use. For anybody looking at wireless key-pad to unclutter the desk, I would highly recommend this product. This product is slightly expensive as compared to cheaper plastic ones available in the market, but the quality difference is immense and covers the differential cost."
5,"Value for moneyFound better than expectedBeautiful premium lookYou will not be disappointed.I use it with my laptop, ipad, iPhone, and android phone. Works well with all devices.3 devices at a time are connected and can switch between three with just one key press."
5,"Till now I was using Targus KB55. While that wasn't bad, off late the keys in Targus have been going a bit soft and sometimes unresponsive. Didn't want to shell out huge bucks for magic keyboard. Decided to give this one a shot and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. The slim layout, key response/travel, connectivity, and customizations is amazing. If you're looking for a budget mac keyboard, this is it!"
5,"It appears like a vintage type writer with circular keys. The key stroke is also comparatively harder than laptop keyboards. It is really handy, small, fits into a small laptop bag. Coming to the function, the 3 device Bluetooth connection feature is awesome. A special mention, it has shortcut keys for android and apple, which includes, home button undo, screenshot, and many more. I am really enjoying this keyboard and hats-off to the Logitech's logical idea.However, I started using it yesterday only. I will update my review within an year with any cons if I find. Happy multi-tasking!!!"
5,"It is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. The weight gives you the feel and understanding of the build quality. Excellent with using multiple devices at once. You can switch from Devise 1 to 2 in just one click of a button.The typing experience is premium. As it is a compact keyboard (60%) it is not designed to be ergonomically effective, but it is not bad as well in that aspect.One of the highlighting aspects of this keyboard is, how small this is. Having so much functionality and being so small in size is really fascinating.Being 60% keyboard, it does an excellent job in having all the function keys which you might need. I have used it on my Windows PC, Android and iPhone as well. It has worked wonders on all three devices.Highly recommended product."
5,"I was a little skeptical about the circular buttons and also the compatibility with my MacBook Pro. Now, I feel far more comfortable with this keyboard than the MacBook's butterfly keyboard! In fact, I don't think I would be going back to a keyboard with squared keys. There was absolutely no setup or keymap changing required; I use this in the same way as a normal Apple keyboard.The first three function keys makes it so easy to switch between my iPhone, MacBook and Android TV. Though it is too early for me to tell, all the reviews I've seen on YouTube confirmed that the battery life is well over two years. As for the sound, all keys are far quieter than a normal keyboard, except for the spacebar which is slightly louder. By all means I am happy I went for this over an Apple Magic Keyboard."
5,"This is a great device. The feel, the key travel, the portability and ease to use and connect. its just an flawless experience. No doubt its bit pricy but that what you have to pay for an quality product. Its sleek small and fits in any where. It looks bigger in picture . but actually its too portable and comfortable to carry anywhere and use.I am writing this review using the same. I received it today. If any glitches I will update the post.But for now I am experiencing an awesome typing experience. If you are in market looking for an Bluetooth keyboard just go for it. Nothing can get better than this."
2,"I bought this product after being disappointed by the K840 which had connectivity issues with my Mac Book Air 2020 model.Initially, the product connected quickly and was working well. I used it along with the apple mouse and it still did not have issues.Issues started arising when I connected my laptop to another screen using the USB C Hub. The keyboard got disconnected and has never worked properly when I connect a secondary screen to my macbook air.As soon as I connected my airpods to the Mac, the keyboard went crazy and started typing things on its own and since then I haven't been able to use the keyboard. It doesn't pair with my mac unless I restart the mac.The return time window passed since i recently purchased a new set of airpods and now I am stuck with a keyboard that goes bonkers if connected to the laptop. Very disappointed with the purchase. I wish there can be any resolution to this.As of now, i am back to using a wired keyboard that works perfectly with the airpods connected and the secondary display. There are too many wires on my desk. :("
5,"While a bluetooth keyboard is primarily used for its wireless capabilities, which this works fine for. The weight is a little too much for portability.The keystone is superbly refined and silent. I love typing on this keyboard and now prefer it over the Mac original keyboard.Good for its price as well. Happy with the buy."
5,I have worked for 2 days on the keyboard and writing this review.I have connected with lenovo smart tab and apple ipad both. The switch between the two devices are smooth and faulent.Device is compact and can be placed parallel to laptop or other keyboard on the desk if you are working with multiple devices.Built quality is fantastic and the keys are big and easy to type. Basic functionality are provided with dedicated buttons for easy manhover.I would have been good if height adjustable functionality could have been incorporated.
5,"I've been waiting for the price of this keyboard to fall for over a year. Finally, it fell and bought it.This is a Bluetooth keyboard which is meant for people who use more than 1 device. I use a regular Windows Desktop & an iMac. Having 2 keyboards on my desk was really frustrating.The setup took barely 2 minutes on both my computers. Switching works as expected and is extremely fast.The build quality of the keyboard is far better than I thought. The key travel is nice and the different shape will take a little getting used to.Overall fantastic product and I highly recommend it."
1,"Not so great keyboard, but a basic Mechanical Keyboard. The RGB is weird, every time you restart/start, the lighting’s gets reset. Not Individually lit RGB(I don’t expect that at this pricing). Though it says anti ghosting. Its not! I faced multiple times that keys are ghosted while playing Games. Yet Value for money.Ok, adding on. Dont buy this keyboard.the Cosmic Byte support is one of the worst support team in the world. My keyboard failed to work and upon contacting the support they were like, what should one expect for 3k value product. Means, this product is supposed to for one year only. Instead of spending money on these cosmic Byte products. Add 1k more and buy a good Keyboard. Even Logitech G 413 is better than Cosmic Byte’s Crap!"
5,"This is my first mechanical gaming keyboard, used membrane keyboards earlier and was used to it but this change felt nice.About the keyboard- Sturdy heavy build, looks much better in person than in picture, chrome bezel looks nice and colour intensity is amazing. Texture and slope of keys can be worked upon by company, but that's not much of a problem. Also, there is no inbuilt memory for colour profile selected. Overall this was the best purchase at the offered price of 1575. The company doesn't have many service centres so the longetivity of the keyboard remains an issue. Will update if any problem arises."
4,"This is an awesome keyboard in this price range and it has no build quality issue. Its keys are nice and clicky and having good feedback as well. But there is some issue with the driver of this keyboard I think.The main issue with this keyboard is, sometimes it skips the keystrokes while typing. I am using this keyboard for 3 days and I have faced this problem at least 2 to 3 times in a single usage. It's not a hardware issue, I searched for that problem and I found that its a driver issue. So I visited the official website of Cosmic Byte and there was no driver available for any Cosmic byte keyboards. So, its a kind request from Cosmic byte to provide a proper driver for your keyboards. Thank you"
5,"this keyboard is amazing for a 1st time user of mechanical keyboard or for someone who is making the switch from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical keyboard.I got this one because it has the full 104 keys.it feels so easy to type on this, you will feel less fatigue typing on these.i have used corsair k55 and logitech k380 bluetooth keyboard.so far i have not faced any defects with the key or the keyboard and it has been a couple of weeks.i have the brown switches and personally coming from a membrane keyboard these switches are surprisingly loud, good that i didnt get the blue switches. i wonder how loud those would have been.it is difficult to lube these switches since they are soldered to the pcb. so i will just deal with the loudness.feels good to type and game. the bump on these switches are almost..... not noticeable when you type.coming from membrane keyboard initially i made so many errors while typing because these feel so much lighter. after some i got used to it.i have heard cosmic byte service is good. so lets see how long this will last. i dont expect much from a 2300 keyboard but so far this has been going good.Will update whenever something goes wrong.the build is fine but the quality lacks refinement.The rainbow lighting is not as bad as i thought it would be and the lighting is fine and some effects are cool.final verdict i would say the product looks much better in person than in photos."
5,"I purchased it when it was first available after pendamic i.e 4th Oct in Rs.2000. I am using it consistantly for above 8 hrs or more every day for my professional use. I buyed it just for typing experience and my accounts n operation work, need lots of calculation so number keys is also performing good and using it for my ofc use. I don't care about lighting effect coz i am touch typist and my avg speed is 55 wpm.I must say it is one of the best keyboard available in the market. Its also compact in size.The only Con i notices is it is slightly wobble or stabilization issue but don't spoil typing experience and keys are super soft and just need small force to register. Far better then chicklet key. Half pressed or lazily pressed also register the key.I don't like cleaky sound so i purchased brown switches which is from Outemu brand and it is also respectable brand in international market after Cherry switches. It's good over kaihl switches and can't be compared to gixian as per you tube videos and some research done about types of mechanical switches. So in short otemu is 2nd best after cherry switches. Go for it and far better typing experience than those chicklet keyboards"
1,"Build quality is excellent in price range but the main fault was key prints are not clearly visible look likes faded i dont know its only in my piece.I am reviewing it again yesterday my W,A,Sand D jeys stopped working only in 2 months tume what a bad thing it is . I will not recommend it to anyone instead buy some reputed brands."
1,"Please dont use these type of things and damage your display.. i already done 😪..atleast these companies should give advice along with while using...but nothing... what happened is i closed with the keyboard cover occassionally (its not handy to remove keyboard cover each and everytime of use)..so i mistakely closed the screen with keyboard cover on it and it damaged my screen by many small dots..i was trapped by a dash** youtuber ! ... just use a butter paper after the use or in gaps while opened without the time of using... this types of products are serious threat to quality of our devices,as it directly effect the screen display..so beware..."
5,"For a MBP that costs a lot, I think it is totally worth to get this keyboard cover. Our fingers no matter how much we wash, gets its own oil on the keyboard and can make it messy over a period of time.I have used Oaky for an older MBP model as well (butterfly keyboard), the keyboard is still working great thanks to the cover. I bought this for my new MBP without second thoughts. It fits well and is easy to clean and replace."
4,"Review -Oaky keyboard protectorDelivery- This was on time ,actually it arrived earlier than scheduled ,which is surprising given the expected sluggishness of deliveries during the pandemic times.Quality -Is Ok ,not outstanding but given the  price points ,it is acceptable.It is thin [0.01mm] .I chose the TFT variant over the silicon and rubber variant since it is thinner than the other two.It is also less likely to leave impressions impressions on the display unit upon closure of the laptop/notebook.It certainly is plenty capable of protecting one’s precious keyboard from greasy finger tips since that is the main purpose of the film.It is transparent hence  it can be used in low light environments since the backlit keyboard light is visible through it .Is washable and removable .An extension of it that covers the touch bar and start button, would have been welcome.cons-It does not adhere/stick sufficiently to the keyboard and moves slightly during usage . If it had the lettering on it’s undersurface which fits the counterparts on the keys it probably would be more stable.Due to this slight instability the typing speed does gets slowed down lest one makes more typing errors.I am given to know that the manufacturers of my laptop do not recommend the usage of keyboard cover ,but I am going to retain it ."
5,"The best part about this product is it fits perfectly fine on the keyboard. What I really liked about this product is how the keys are already printed on it. I have earlier used a transparent protector which after a while becomes slightly yellow in colour so they keys visibility becomes slightly less. Here because the keys are already printed you can hardly tell if there's a protector on. While compared to other companies its priced also low.highly recommend this for anyone planning to buy protector for MacBook Pro 16"""
4,"This is best there is, it doesn’t feel like there a protector and the surface finish is smooth and doesn’t stick to the screen when closed and backlit light doesn’t dim (50% in image) . While Typing fast it shakes a bitAnd u get the extra bits of safety caps for charging and headphone jackPrice is too much."
2,"You might think of this as a waste of time review but let me tell you. After putting these keyboard protector on, you might like it well for 2 weeks. but after that it shows its true colours. The laptop starts heating too much and after contacting Apple they told that nothing should be put over keyboard. So, it is a total waste of money...."
5,Looking real good on my macbook pro.Perfect fit for the keyboard.Noone can tell the difference between real keyboard and skin applied keyboard using this product.Really great product to use and also not that much costly as other company selling same product.Loved it.Thank you so much for providing wonderful product in reasonable price.😊
5,Low price & nice product. This is totally fine don't buy other costlier protector.
3,"It's great because its sheer (so there are no issues of keyboard backlight not getting through etc) but the texture is very plasticky (as opposed to rubberised) so its difficult to type with. because of the kind of material its made with, its also more susceptible to moving out of place easily, so its not the best fit."
4,"I expected it to have a snug fit on the keyboard but it seems a little projected - like a 3D effect. Never used a keyboard skin before - so I am not sure if this is how all keyboard skins are. But all said and done, it seems to fit ok. I am able to move it and clear the dust on top of the keyboard. Considering the cost of a MacBook Pro 16 inch, even if there is a remote chance that this cover will protect it from dust, it's worth trying."
4,Compatible for Macbook Air. Super stickey. Rubber is very good quality. Adhere to the keyboard. Cons- keyboard light is not visible.Overall satisfied
3,"Outrageously overpriced product in the name of apple accessory. it would cost just between Rs 50 - Rs 100, selling at Rs 500."
3,"Please improve your product quality in terms of adhesion to the keyboard, otherwise, the product is quite good. It's transparent enough for back-light and even fits very well on the keyboard."
3,Very expensive for just a small keyboard case and fits good and not so great looking. We pay 500 for a piece or rubber
5,Except for the fact that it's a tad bit too pricey for a single keyboard protector alone deal....its good quality....thin but does its job well...fits perfectly
5,"Being a coder the keyboard gets used a lot. The keyboard print wears off quickly, even on light usage. You cannot carry any extra keyboard if you travel. So this protection comes in handy"
4,Cons: The thickness must be lesser than what it is. Beside the colour is so dark so that the letters do not appear even if you turn on keyboard backlit in full brightness.Pros: Perfect fit.
5,Before buying I was bit worried about the quality and thickness of the keybord protector because I don't want to scratch my screen but it is very thin and perfect fit for my Macbook pro m1.
4,"It's good. Size is correct for mac pro M1 13 inch.Only cons of buying the black one is at night with no room light , the keyboard light will not be visible otherwise overall good."
1,The typing experience with this keyboard cover is horrible. Fitting of the cover was perfect but the clear case is not value for money
3,I ordered it in Aug 2020 and by Feb 2020 its wear and tear has caused fading on most used keys and is not torn near a few keys.
2,Does not fit correctly.
2,"The keyboard shield width is bit shorter I think, not perfectly overlaying on the keyboard, especially the left side of the keyboard."
4,"I feel like this is a necessity to prevent any kind of dust, little spill on the keyboard.Typing is comfortable, tho can't trust water-resistant. Hoped the price would be a little less"
3,The company should make it a bit thick so that it doesn't keep flying in the air after switching on the table fan.
5,I was kinda skeptical about the cutout and it's fitting but they have nailed it down to a T. Great grip and even stays on when the laptop is upside down. I actually prefer the rubbery typing experience.
4,"This is not a black colour but a rose gold, this of not mentioned in the description.Rest the product is functional & good."
1,"Cost wise iGear Dual Connect Bluetooth Keyboard just around 500 INR cheaper than ""Logitech 480 Multi Device Bluetooth Keyboard"", although you are paying around 1800 to 2000, just add one another 500 and go for the Logitech bluetooth keyboard.Things what I faced with this keyboard are following:  1. In every around 5 hours, you need to charge it.  2. You don't use this keyboard for 1 or 2 minutes, automatically it got disconnected.  3. Around a 9 hours of day you probably were getting many times connected and disconnected shadow pop.  4. Many times a keys lacks, got overwritten, and get missed.  5. In MacOS Mojave & Catalina the ""Esc"" key won't work.  6. Many times got frustrated because of not working issue.  7. Finishing & Material wise it looks great, feature wise not upto the mark.  8. Don't waste your money by buying iGear this product, blindly go for Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse."
1,It is a useless prouduct.  Offen the connection gets interrupted.
3,"Looks good but its very heavy for a keyboard (probably due to the lithium battery)Same as shown in the picture but the function is placed different as shown in the picture. Also, the cut, copy and paste function key do not work.Minimal noise while typing."
1,"As you see in my hheadline and hhhere if i press HH eiter it does not press or it presses too muchh to multiple times ... this has caused me biggg panic as same issue wit key GG ,, Whhhhen i tried to open it it did not open even after removingg 6 screws at back... thhe only option i am left wit is to trow it away and try to forget my Rs 2000 wasted on this pathetic product..."
5,"Excellent BT Keyboard with balanced weight, where my iPad never slips. Product is value for money. Connects 2 devices, my iPad and POCO F1 Android simultaneously with a single change over switch. Thanks i-Gear for this item. It works fine from the day one I purchased i.e. April 2021. I am satisfied very much. The delivery was before the committed time. Cheers Amazon...👍"
4,"the keyboard is easy to configure and very handy. for now i fell battery life is really great and lasts long with high usage, easy to switch between devices . works  nicely with my windows and mac ,not aure homy many people with connect to use with phones, but it works."
1,The product exactly stopped working after 1 year. I bought this in spite of it being more expensive than Logitech and what I get is it workable only for an year. No value for money.
5,While ordering i was bit hesitant seeing a negative review but i still went ahead with same and let me tell you guys no regret at all the device is great works with ipad and phone...thanks amazon. great product
4,Very good customer relationship. Much appreciated.
1,Charger not working. Waste of money. Return also closed. Never buy it
5,Simply Super Product.
5,Superb product. Worth for money
4,"This keyboard help to work on multiple devices simultaneously.Very good product ,saves lot of time  and cost effective too."
5,solid device with a great back up and the keys and connectivity the best
5,"a beautiful product. Works with Mac, Windows and android. Hassle free."
4,Good product easily installed
5,Best quality
3,"Its a decent keyboard with backlit RGB. Considering the cost range, I was honestly not expecting state of the art ergonomics or RGB, for the prize range it does provide good value for money. However, you expect product to work atleast for a year without giving issues. For me, many keys did not work as expected after first 3 months. Apart from that, till the time it worked, it was a decent piece."
4,"Update: 2nd May 2019.....Changing rating from 3 to 4 stars. 5 months of gaming usage and it is still working!The product picture showed is not what I received. Two days of usage and the space bar gets stuck time and again. The keys feel very delicate hence this is not for heavy gaming. Perhaps not even casual gaming. Anyways, at this price do not expect a gaming keyboard.Update 8th Dec: Ordered a replacement and received it. Will post the update after using it at least for a week or two.Update 15th Dec: 1 week of gaming usage and the product is still alive. At the price I bought I think 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
5,"Got this Keyboard for Office use, the keyboard is sturdy doesn’t make noise and didn observe any cons ;If you are working from Home using your laptop I would recommend to get this keyboard or any other keyboard; we tend to type hard sometimes ; laptops are delicate and single key issue would make you run towards a service centre !"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
2,It felt like a really cheap keyboard although it actually is a cheap keyboard but still the feel while typing or doing any work and the quality of the keys the press nothing was impressive I felt like a better keyboard in a just a little more budget would be far better than this but if I was trip budget then you can go for this you can easily do your work and it won't disappoint you.
5,I received the keyboard in a sealed packing however the mouse pad mention on the box was missing inside the package when opened. I am returning the shipment and expecting a replacement.
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
3,"keyboard is awesome but i have use it more than 2 months its alphabets are fating down ,color nikal raha haii , aagar typing ke liya lena hai ti mat lo bekar haii ungliya dard ho jayengii ,gaming ke liya  thik thak haiii but uttna aacha nahii ahii 1k ki price maii aur v aata ahii thoda aur jodka corsear ke keyboard aata haii wahii lo best ahiii gaming aur coding aur typing ke liya best ."
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
5,"Very smooth around the edges and the keypress.,Prints on key also looks appealing.keys are silent.not a gaming keyboard tho.lets see how long it lasts ."
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,Produxt went bad within 1month of purchase and due to pandamic we arr not able to replace as visiting service center will take more time
2,Appearance is good. The functionality is worst. Some keys won't function and some keys repeats if you press once.
4,Quality of keyboard is acceptable in comparison to its price.
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
1,With great hope I have order combo but I have received damaged mouse ...it's very disappointed ...so I return the product and order another one hope I would be getting good quality product.
3,"USB cable is of very poor quality and very thin. But for the price, no complaints. Not suitable for gaming."
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,"Amount was reasonable, very smooth for handling too may be. But I don't know why the package was not good and safe because when I opened I found two broken pieces of Keyboard. Immediately clicked for a return."
1,Worst product ..... Received item in damaged condition twice.... Intex is much better .... Purchased intex .... And now I am working with it.
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
1,For one click it types more alphabetsSome time keys not functionsWhat to do now return date also overRaw material smells
2,The keyboard start giving issue in 2 mths where the keywords does not work and enters wrongs alphabet
3,Satisfied the product
1,"After 2 months of use, the keys are getting stuck when pressed. Do not buy it."
5,Excellent product
4,First thing is that I didn't received the Mouse Pad with keyboard as said in product title.
1,"Bought it two days ago. Outside packaging was good but original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle was missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement."
5,"Excellent keyboard and mouse combo. Silent touch is very nice, I can't hear any sound from keyboard very quiet. I like it is water proof and has vents and holes in the bottom to drain any accidental spills. Mouse works and tracks nicely, accurate to the clicks and double clicks. One dongle only for the keyboard and mouse so no need to worry about using up 2 ports. Both mouse and keyboard has a place to plug the USB dongle while not in use so you don't fear of losing. Also both mouse and keyboard has on-off buttons so you can save battery by switching it off by your end of day."
3,"No issues with the functioning of the keyboard and mouse. They are both working well. I am satisfied with the ""silent"" feature. However, I found the keyboard keys slightly harder on the fingers than I would like. And my biggest issue is, the mouse doesn't come with rubber base. So it slips if you use it on a slanted table/desk. It's not even standing on normal mouse pads. I have to find a mouse pad that has a non-smooth antislip surface.Update after 6 months of minimal usage : Left button of the mouse stopped working. The mouse is useless now."
5,"The keyboard is excellent. As described in the product description it is very silent. I can’t hear it over my fan. That is more than good enough for me. I bought this product assuming that I can connect it to Logitech unifying receiver. I have a M720 mouse which I love to bits. I wanted to give this mouse to my wife and use just the keyboard. I realized only after unboxing that it will only work with the USB dongle it came with. I wanted to return the product, I tried using the keyboard for a day and decided the keyboard alone was worth paying the 2,500 and I kept the product. I wish the keyboard is supported by the Logitech options software. I could have changed the key binding of some of the shortcut keys given at the top.Don’t get me wrong mouse is not bad, it just too small for me. I am very used to my M720 which is almost as big as MX Master. Mouse tracking is good. But, as mentioned in some other reviews it is super light and have very little resistance on a wooden table. It just flies from one corner of the screen to another. May be with some use I can get used to the weight of this mouse. It is not a fair comparison to compare this to my M720 as that mouse alone cost almost twice as much as this combo. This mouse is supported by the Logitech options software and you can assign around 5 shortcuts to the mouse which is great to see at this price point."
1,Very poor order delivery. First time the order was received without the usb receiver. Returned and reordered. The rellace.ent came without the mouse !!
3,"After 2 days:Keyboard is not working in Mac and Ubuntu/Linux OS.I need to close to the USB receiver ( 2-5cm distance) in order to work.For this price 2395 it is not worth.Other keyboard K220 bought a year before working fine. Need a replacement.Initial Impression:This is one of the best keyboard and mouse i ever used.Typing speed is absolutly very smooth and there is no key press sound. Very little noise but it wont disturb any one who is near by.Mouse is really silky smooth and no click sound at all.only thing it has very soft keys no soundmouse is really smooth and very silent.Price wise this is little high 2395, if it is 1999 it would be best value for money.one USB nano receiver is great to handle both keyboard and mouse.I am using this keyboard for my raspberry pi 4. Since RPI4 has limitted USB ports so using this one USB receiver is really helpful."
1,5 stars for product but 2 stars for seller.Product received was not seal packed. I could make out that tapes were opened and then re-pasted. The mouse from keyboard mouse combo was not working. Keyboard was working very well.So i placed return with replacement order. I received the replacement within a day but i was scared looking at the condition of the replaced product box. It was battered with tape applied instead of original seal tape. I have uploaded photographs of the packing.Fortunately this time both mouse and keyboard are working and are working good.
3,"I received the the product in just 9 hours, delivery wise and packaging wise everything was good, the boxes were in very good condition without any damageChanging my comment on the product in just two days.  1) I feel the key press should have been little more softer  2) I did one test with this keyboard and the dell laptop keyboard in the night when it completely pin drop silence  environment.  what i observed was that the dell laptop keyboard is also not silent but the key press noise is lower  compare to the Logitech keyboard.  i tried typing few sentences with the Logitech keyboard and same sentences again with the dell laptop  keyboard.  3) if you type slow also there is noise on the key press.  4) found that only the alpha keys , numeric keys(not the numpad keys) , arrow keys,  5) space bar, tab, enter, shift, alt, ctrl key are somewhat silent compared to the alpha and numeric keys  6) Price is very high  and the usb receiver is also not unifying one at this price.  7) even the click of the mouse button is not silent as mentioned. I have Logitech M331, which is way silent than  the M220 mouse provided with the keyboard.reducing my rating of this product just because it does not meet the requirement of silent touch, also i have given the product 3 star just because it is not that bad as well if you see the other aspects of product like the plastic quality is good, you have volume control option and also I don't have any doubt on the battery life because i have already used Logitech product earlier as well and they proved to be lasting longer compared to dell mouse where i used to change the batteries twice or thrice in a month."
5,"i liked the keyboard, i have the habit working late with my kids working beside. typing my older keyboards wake up my kid and disturb his sleep. this is one is so silent soft work. very sift srispy typing feel i get. it has capslock indicator which is sufficient for as numlocks and scroll locks i hardly use.Mouse too is very silent soft. it has very high promising battery life, hop it lasts long.It has been 8 months, now i observe first signs of low battery, connectivity issues comes up. Yes alkaline batteries do last long, really long in this keyboard"
5,"Writing this review after one week of use.It is a very good quality combo set of keyboard and mouse.. Received in perfect condition. Keyboard and Mouse both are super silent (no tik-tik anymore). Full size keyboard. Medium size mouse (Model: M220-SilentTouch). Just plug the tiny receiver, switch ON the keyboard and Mouse buttons and it immediately starts working. Get rid of hassles of wiresI had also checked Logitech MK270R combo which was approx. Rs.1000 less than this but finally decided to go with this due to the factors such as Silent Touch, Longer Battery Life and Newer Model. And after using it for a week, I think it was a good decision.I recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of wiring around their PC/Laptop and looking for clean desk.Overall a very nice product and good buy."
5,"Finally the best after trying 3 different one, tired the Dell entry level combo (that was undoubted worst) then tried Logitech MK345 it works like a typewriter ( key punch sounds) , sold that on olx for half the price when I purchased this one . Not about the product . Its just AWSOME ! , the key feel and the mouse both . Keyboard is very well built and feels great . Both keyboard and mouse have rugged feel when you touch. Its great in the Work from Home environment specially if you work late night and don't want to disturb  someone with the keystrokes and mouse clicks . Not only keyboard even the mouse clicks are (almost) noise less . This is not 100% silent but no one should be able to hear and gets disturbed by the keystroke noise . if you want to quantify of noise eradication will it eradicates more than 90-95% key click noise"
4,Wow.. i am really surprised with this keyboard. This is exactly what i was looking for in a keyboard all my life. I have been searching for a keyboard where i dont get those irritated clicking noise in my mouse and keyboard both and wanted a very soft touching slient option. My search ended here. But my search was little ruined as the layout of the keyboard is not to my taste.The buttons dont have spacing between them. Even the lines between keys are not much. I want a better layout to make this as perfect choice of keyboard for life.I like big layout style keyboard for faster typing speeds along with hand rest at the bottom and multimedia keys for faster handling of medias.
1,"The moment I opened the package, I could see that it was already opened by someone and then put together half heartedly. I anyway gave it a chance and connected to my laptop. The connection was fast and there was no visible lag. However, the keys were malfunctioning a lot. Changing language automatically, some of the keys not working at times (you have to remove the receiver and plug it in again). I have raised a request for the replacement. Will update once the replacement is here."
4,"What I like:1. Excellent keyboard. Just the right weight, sturdy, does not slide away when you type, good wireless connection, smooth & silent typing, good travel of keys. Note: This keyboard makes absolutely no sound at all and if you are one who enjoys your keyboard's sound - this is not the product for you.2. The mouse is precise in its working. Clicks are silent.3. Product is well packaged. The receiver is kept in an easily accessible place in the carton box.4. There is a place to store the receiver (below the keyboard), if you wish to carry the product around.What could have been better:1. The mouse is very small for my hand. For this price, they could have given a full size mouse. The current mouse is not comfortable to use if you have medium to large hands.2. The scroll wheel of the mouse is very noisy.2. The caps-lock LED is almost useless as it is too dim to be visible during the day."
5,"The keys are silent - they don't make clicky noises. That's not to say it doesn't make sound, it does. It's just muffled and low-frequency.The keys are sturdy and seem to be of good quality for the price. I personally feel there's a bit too much resistance though. Typing casually is fine, but if you're a writer and write multiple pages per day, maybe you should consider chicklet style keys. I use this primarily for work, to compose a few emails per day, interact with others on chat, and create occasional documents, and I have been very satisfied with it. On long typing sessions, it sure gives your fingers a workout, but it's not a deal breaker."
4,"The keyboard is extremely quiet, although the typing is not that comfortable due to the key feedback being a little too hard. Maybe that will be ok after getting used to it.Separate indicator for caps lock but none for num lock. Otherwise keyboard has all the keys in the right place.Truly plug and play with both Ubuntu and Windows"
4,"This is a good product. I am writing this review after using this keyboard-mouse combo for around 1 month and I am satisfied with this product.Keyboard is about 90% silent and is easy to use; no tak-tak noise but still some sort of sound is there while typing, which is ok. Also Mouse is working good and has a good grip."
4,"I don’t think I can get used to using this silent touch, basically compared to the mechanical keyboard I have used, I think I keep getting the keys wrong always, it feels small and does not fit well. The typing experience is a bit down but it’s super silent for one and has the promised wireless. Basically I needed it for using whenever I get on bed, so it doesn’t father me much now, but as a main keyboard it lacks at a lot of places, at this price range"
4,Box was a mess(the sets box). But the product itself is very very silent. If you using mk270 then the difference will be the feel of mesh can be felt clearly. So if you dont mind little hard on gaming you can go for it else 270 or some other i guess? Only 4 stars since box is ruined.Ps: The switch sure helps out the battery.
1,The keyboard isn't working properly. There is so much lag sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Such a pathetic product with such high price. Bought it after reading reviews but all my money got wasted. Logitech being such a big and famous brand selling such kind of products. Shame!!
4,Overall product is good. I cannot comment on battery as its news so use ur judgement. The only sketchy part is the on/off slide switch they are of plastic and i don't know how long would they survive esp the mouse one.. I felt they should have used the metal switch like dell which could be robust for the price we are paying. That's it for now. Cheers!
1,"I bought this product and found Keyboard is not working properly. I had requested for replacement of the product. But, the replaced product was not in good condition at all. I have returned all the keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle. However, the replaced product which I got today looks like the original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle were missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement.  I need to apply for replacement again which is really annoying. I think whoever from Amazon is reviewing these comments should immediately act on it to get the good sealed product with good condition should be delivered on time."
5,"Very good and interesting product. The silence while typing is very weird initially cause the feeling of keys while typing is same. Only complaint would be that mouse is size small and not most ergonomic, but cant complain too much at this price point."
5,A good keyboard with silent touch and mouse with silent click as expected. So far working well. Hope it lasts well. The functioning of the keys is much better than the earlier Logitech model that I was using.Packet delivery was professional.
3,"It is actually a silent keyboard when compared to other regular keyboards. Although it has some sound though from the key travel, it's not loud enough to disturb anyone outside the room. I am using a full size keyboard after years and it's actually quite comfortable after you get used to it.I do not like the mouse at all. It's not ergonomic design so using it for long working sessions is very uncomfortable. But that's least of the problems. The mouse hangs between two monitors which is very annoying. I have tried adjusting the settings but this problem hasn't resolved."
5,To unleash the full potential download Logitech Options software from Logitech to customize the mouse buttons and actions. To customize keyboard download Karabiner-Elements and you can map all the keys.Overall the experience is splendid and the keys are great for typing!!
5,"Logitech MK295 wireless keyboard and M220 wireless mouse combo is a great buy in terms of product quality. Buttons are really silent. This combo stands up to my expectation in terms of quality. I believe the Price is a little on higher side. If it could be priced in range of INR 1800 - INR 2000, it would make this product Superb value for money."
5,"I have used many logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the past, but this model is fun to use, just because of its silent feature. Many in the past has failed due to mouse click issues and dongle issues, hope this lives to the expectation."
5,"I was using mk275 logitech prior to this. Had a bad experience with that one, noisy keys, with couple of keys not working properly. Was skeptical about this one. BUT - this is an excellent keyboard. It really is silent! no noise. All keys have excellent feel, not missing any letters. It also has a capslock indicator. I would say its really a great keyboard and mouse combo. Go for it."
1,"the keyboard is great and very sleek and silent. but couple of keys not working when i used it. unfortunately i noticed the issue after the return window elapsed. now i am left with a keyboard without caps lock ,shift key and number 7"
4,"I'm not going to review the mouse - I'm only using the keyboard with a G304.This was used to upgrade a MK345, which had earlier replaced a MK235. The 345 was a better keyboard but the unbroken F key line and exclusion of dedicated media controls was a real issue.I use these keyboards on the bed, in the lap and they're way below eye level, so looking at the keyboard isn't always possible. Also, requiring to press two keys simultaneously to control volume is very cumbersome.The 540 is a pretty heavy and large keyboard. The 345, while larger and heavier than the 235, was easier to use because it wouldn't tip over easily. The 540 feels twice as heavy, but surprisingly, much more comfortable.The large palmrest keeps the wrist at a good angle to the keys, and is not contoured. This means I get good palm action across all the keys. The keys themselves are quite soft and also have a fairly tactile feel. Because the keyboard is so heavy, pressing keys at one end doesn't tip it over. At the same time, it's not so heavy as to cause leg ache. Maybe if used for a few hours, but for casual use it's great.Though I haven't used the mouse, like all wireless Logis it will exhibit middle button failure after a month or two. It looks pretty slick with the retro two-tone colour scheme, but there's no additional buttons to make it any more interesting to use than other mice on the family.Range is decent (I use an extension cable to avoid any issues), but there is some crosstalk with the G series receiver. The MK345 was immune to this, so I could use that keyboard with the G304 mouse.If you are able to secure a new unit (my first one was unsealed, probably a returned unit, with the receiver missing - the replacement was fine), this is a pretty decent buy."
5,"Best comfort, Its very soft and mechanical keyboard.  There is a capslock light on the button, you can turn off/on, there are multimedia keys, You can turn on/off numslock but no indicator. There is a indicator to show your keyboard is on and it turns on only when required.The keys are so soft and ergonomically placed. The handrest is also soft and good. The rubber coated mouse is so good to hold. The reviews on small mouse I don't agree. Its the best combo I ever had. Please go for it. If you need comfort and quality.Also it has 4"" and 8"" to comfort your wrist.After a long usage for 12 hours a day,  I feel it's the best product you can look for"
3,"Bought this after reading good reviews and complaint that tge mouse is big. I wanted a bug mouse.The keyboard and mouse were recognized instantly on Windows, and working as expected.Problem: Keyboard keys are too soft. There is no feedback. So typing isn't satisfying. Even my laptop keys feel better.Mouse is long, but narrow. Don't know how people are complaining about size. I wanted a wider one.Sadly, the item is not returnable."
1,"After using for 6 months, feeling this to be worst product from Logitech and very disappointing. Cheaper wireless k/b and mouse combo from Logitech used before is far better than this product. Very expensive and not a good product. Key press are very slow and sometimes wrong key press happens due to the slow rate. Not worth for the money paid."
5,"Bought the keyboard mouse combo. Keyboard is broad and full. It is a membrane keyboard but still does offer some form of noise when typing. Some of the keys can be reprogrammed with the software downloadable on Logitech's website. Talking about the mouse, it took a few days to get used to it as I was coming from a HP dual mode mouse with side buttons. Mouse is a bit on the heavy side. The grips have a rubberised feel to them and I like it. The sensitivity cannot be adjusted which is a bummer. Only downside is that only a single receiver is given (attached on the inner flap of the box). Feel free to ask me any questions you have."
5,"This is a very comfortable to use keyboard, keys are very smooth, and has right balance of travel distance on press and yet silent. The undulating curve on each very is also good design. The prints are clear and hope it will long. The short cut keys are very useful. The keyboard and mouse are very easy to set up and just works seamlessly once the dongle is plugged to the usb port of laptop. Includes battery from Duracell is very  customer friendly gesture and eases the setup right out of the box.If I have to be picky about two drawbacks1. The palmrest could be little bigger and soft fabric for better feel2. Mouse could have some side buttonsThe same keyboard is sold in Amazon US at similar price point with the above two features included."
5,"Keys are really smooth and comfortable. Very less noise from keys but still gives a good typing feel. Bought logitec cheaper version before which was also good but makes noise while typing. So, gave it to my kid and took this one. This is cool.Mouse is full size. Fits hand properly. If you are a fan of smaller models, you may not like it."
1,"Think, have received an used product. Even Bluetooth connector is not in dedicated slot. It’s just kept in the packing cover"
2,"The keys awfully closer than you might like which slows you down considerably. The mouse does not have a DPI setting and is painful to use. Even for normal office work, it is not a suitable mouse and the comfort is missing. The mouse pointer is slow and even changing the pointer setting in Windows did not render the speed as desired. The Logitech support software too does a poor job in changing the mouse's pointer speed. There are a variety of useless customization settings available on the Logitech software whereas the necessary DPI setting is missing. One of the positives from the keyboard is that it is completely a silent keyboard. The hand rest feature is very good. The multimedia button for play/pause does not work with YouTube on Google Chrome. There is a button to verify whether the battery is empty or not which is again useless for two reasons. First, when you press any key when the system is off or after a long time, the led battery indicator blinks. Second, when the system is on and you are working on it, do you really need a battery indicator to see if your battery is empty or would you press a key and find out? The keyboard + mouse duo is completely unsuitable for gaming purpose. The keyboard looks highly durable and there is no issue with any of the keys on it, except the play/pause multimedia key as mentioned above. The dual tilt is good and the keyboard has an ergonomic design.Pros:1. Ergonomic Design2. Dual Tilt Keyboard3. Silent Keyboard4. Good Hand Rest Feature5. Multimedia Keys6. Appears to be Highly Durable and Long LastingCons1. Poor Mouse Design2. Poor Mouse Settings3. Poor Mouse Size4. Useless Settings on Logitech Software, Important Ones Missing5. Play/Pause Key not working with YouTube on Chrome6. Useless Battery Indicator Button7. No Option to Change Mouse's DPI Setting8. Not Suitable for Gaming9. Slows Down Typing"
4,"The product is satisfactory. Good soft keys unlike previous generation keyboards with knocking sound. Though soft keys lack sharp feedback, we have all been accustomed to typing without feedback since the advent of laptop keys and touchscreen keyboard. So that is an acceptable con, and in fact a boon if you want to type something silently say in a room where is child is sleeping. Regarding the mouse, it is big enough, and specially long enough, but not wide enough. It fits in my 4 fingers very nicely, but leaves the little finger dangling on the side."
5,"Keys are soft touch and no click clack sound. Wake up from sleep on keystroke as keyboard goes into sleep auto. Palmrest is good enough and keys are raised island style, so you cannot miss a hit on any of the keys. The mouse is also responsive on both flat tabletop surface as well as tablecloth surface, again a wake up from sleep function. Overall a good purchase. Could have been better if Logitech manufactured in India. Why continue to source from China"
4,"It works well, the setup was a breeze because it linked immediately to my existing mouse's unifying dongle. It also types very well with minimal sound, and I think my typing speed has increased a bit too. My only negative about it is that whenever I'm in bed and wanna use it on my lap, it's very slippery. The finishing of the plastic body is very smooth back and front and so there's practically no grip. Considering I do this very often (i call it 'work from bed'), this is an annoyance. Other than that, highly recommended."
5,"Really luxurious look of mouse and keyboard. It shows it has something different from others.Keys are the soft and much better experience of silent writing.Even with Logitech software, we can adjust the number of functions such as mouse scroll speed, smooth scrolling of websites, change keyboard button custom function, etc. Battery notifications are shown on the laptop also.Mouse almost works on any surface."
2,"Was using dell wired keyboard earlier which I had bought for about 600/- INR. This logitech keyboard has a very bad design, very big and heavy compared to the dell keyboard. Keys are very soft compared to dell but gives very weird feel when typing.Had bought it because of the palm rest and  soft keys.. and not satisfied with both.. Dell keyboard without palm rest feels much better. I can't keep my hands on the desktop due to the palm rest. Palm rest only has space for the palm and no support for the arm, it doesn't even allow resting your arm in the desktop because if you do so you won't be able to type properly. Mouse is also big and doesn't fit properly in the hand which causes pain in the palm. Was using logitech mouse with similar design but smaller in size which felt better. I feel like throwing it in the dustbin. Just wasted my 3.5k. Can't type fast in this keyboard. This keyboard is exactly opposite of what I had expected after reading reviews. Typing feel is not good at all irrespective of having soft keys. Space bar is the worst, I hate it the most. I make typing mistakes whenever I touch the spacebar.Pros:- Soft KeysCons:- Big bulky design- Slow typing- Bad Spacebar feedbackWill I recommend it?If you have ""dhai kilo ka hath"" (big hand) then you might like it but still I will suggest to go for a slim keyboard with scissor keys.I wanted to buy mk470 but bought this keyboard because of bad arrow keys placement in mk470. After having bad experience of this keyboard I've ordered mk470 because arrow keys are not that important for me. Will update this review after using mk470. Would have bought Logitech MX keys but that's out of my budget."
3,"It looks very premium, but not actually one.Finish is nice, but importantly keys are very noisy.There are better keyboards than this at lower price range.Not expected such visual gimmicks from Logitech"
4,Comfortable layout . Good mouse. I like the keyboard too. One glitch I felt is there seems to be a delay on keyboard responsiveness at times when it’s connected to my mac . Not sure if this is a defect
5,Pros:1) Easy to use2) Nice treble to the keys3) Sturdy4) really responsive mouseCons:Practically none except the price if u consider tht.
5,"The keyboard keys are so smooth that it becomes a delightful typing experience. It's an almost no noise keyboard. Can't say the same for the mouse though. The mouse is noisier than it's cheaper counterparts, although the material used gives this mouse a much better feel in hand. The mouse size is medium, neither small nor large. Overall, it's a premium product from Logitech both in terms of looks and feel. Worth the buy."
1,Bad do not order at all part were missing amazon refused return do not order by mistake too
5,"Had second thoughts before buying this product as it was a bit costly. But, i really felt that i have spent the money rightly on this keyboard.Keys are so soft to press and its an amazing experience to type on this keyboard.Mouse also is great to move around, it has soft pads, which makes the moving around so smooth.Finally, really happy with the product."
4,"The quality is as expected from Logitech. Volume keys are 'meh'. Rest is fine. Keys are silent, soft and feels good to type on.The keyboard is huge, it occupies half of my desk and heavy as well. It is wireless, so manageable.It is little overpriced."
5,"Works as advertised. Windows 10 was able to detect it. There is no lag. The keys are good and well placed. Apart from the flat position, there are 2 more positions for tilting the keyboard. There is on/off switch. It has indicator for Caps lock. Happy with the purchase."
5,"Product ia really good, easy to use, works great no issues so far.. but it is very expensive compared to other products with same features. It is NOT ergonomic"
1,"Initially, when I got it, it was awesome. But, after using it for 6 months, I see keys getting stuck, getting hard to press. At this price point, I expected a good keyboard. But, I seriously lost trust in Logitech because of this keyboard. I am moving away from Logitech because of poor warranty service, product performancence.Edit: I forgot to talk about the battery life. I just 1 year, i had to change batteries twice. So, the claims that 3 years battery  life is just plain false"
2,"The left button of the mouse is not functioning and not holding the clicks. I purchased in April-end of this year. It has started to show issues like the other low quality mouse so early.  Keyboard is working fine till now. Except it being well crafted and finish, under the hood, they have the same unreliable quality issues.  Wired ones last much longer and are cheap too. Thought the expensive one will last couple of years but it is all the same. Very disappointed."
5,"It is really work, have used mk275 models as well, but this one is much better in terms of smooth and no noise.  Only thing is hand support and border is bit wide and expanded in comparison with MK275 model.  MK275 is small and portable, but this model is really smooth and one cannot even hear the sound of typing"
5,"old traditional type keyboard with silent keys. good mouse. no complaints.. except it would be nice if numlock sign to be on, but i think it is to save battery. fn key is on the right, some keyboards have them on the left."
5,"1. The weight makes the keyboard stable.2. The keys are soft-touch, yet gives enough feedback.3. The edges of keys are rounded reducing accidental touches on nearby keys.4. Silent.5. The palm rest is useful.6. The size looks big, but if you consider the palm rest area of the table used in other keyboards, it does not take too much space.7. The unifying dongle lets you save on USB adaptor space.8. The power button is good for saving battery."
4,"Just bought this product. Keyboard is nice but mouse size acc. to me is big, who uses such a big size mouse these days. I think logitech should make mouse as optional as I wont be able to use this sized mouse. I need to buy separately and this big mouse will becomes waste as it does not have separate USB receiver."
4,"It's good but isn't the quality that I expected, some keys were shaky and loose and this observation was made by purchasing and then replacing and then returning and then buying again, everyone of those set had this issue but now I have made peace with, but you might find it irritating, battery life is good you can just turn it on for whole day and switch off when you go to sleep, the battery will last you a long time"
5,"Best comfort, Its very soft and mechanical keyboard. There is a caps lock light on the button, you can turn off/on, there are multimedia keys, You can turn on/off Num lock but no indicator. There is a indicator to show your keyboard is on and it turns on only when required."
1,The product is not appropriate and looks like it is used product .I paid the whole amount on purchase and expected a good quality product but product is not upto my expectations .i havent recieved the value for money i tried to invest.Also there is no bill for the keyboard.
4,"Got it for a good price at around 3500 INR. Table is cable free, so happy with product."
1,"Bought it in June 2021, multiple keys have stopped working within 3 months.Both Ctrl key, numeric zero, enter key, etc. are not working.Didn't expect this from such a high-priced keyboard."
1,Keyboard does not give any feedback while writing. Keys are slippery while typing. I wanted to return and re-order logitech 850 but could not because Aamazon now removed return policy for the majority of electronic devices. Ended buying two logitch keyboards because I could not return MK540.
3,"Just received it today, keys and typing is extremely smooth. There are many shortcut keys which are useful, I even found a Function key which will be helpful for laptop users. But only thing I found missing is the brightness adjustment keys.Also the packaging from Amazon was very very poor."
4,Smooth touch keyboard - center point between electronic and mechanical keyboards. The mouse grip is good and well designed for long use.
5,Good product with comfortable usability. Price is on the higher side. Build quality is sturdy and strong. Good product for everyday use. Comes with duracell battery inserted.
5,"Good product.Bluetooth connectivity works seamlessly.Look and keys design is really great.Timeout sleep and wakeup on movement or key press is hastel free.Value for money.Only question is about palm rest thing, I think the length is not enough to put palm on palm rest area and type the keys."
5,"Not a professional post. Just a happy customer of this new technology. The unifier experience has been really good. Having to work from multiple devices, this device helps me to shift by just moving USB port. Keyboard keys are soft and responsive and mouse works very well."
5,The protector Cover is perfectly fit. Its worth for the Money spend
4,1. Very Thin Cover2. Fits well on the keyboard3. Affects your typing experience but protects from dust.I think it is over priced. Try to get such covers from the market at lower price else the product is above average.
5,"It's not very thick. I bought it for legion 5 and it fit perfectly. Tbh I really like it. I have used some other on my hp laptop and they were big and didn't fit well. I think it's gonna last, now that is one thing that only time can tell but my first impressions of it are pretty good. You'll not regret it if you buy it but keep in mind the layout of the keyboard."
5,"Got it for my IdeaPad gaming 3. Pretty good. Sits well on the keys, doesn't come in the way of typing. A great investment for your trackpad as dust and other particles getting between the keys reduce any trackpads life.Probably not worth ₹400, but we're overpaying for the Amazon comfort. All things considered, I'd say go for it."
5,This product is totally comfortable i am using it regularly.  Good quality. Satisfied with the product. Go for it
5,Its a Perfect and accurate fit for the Lenovo Ideapad Gaming laptop it just sleeps well on the keyboard. Im kinda impressed! I Recommend this for the Lenovo Legion and lenovo Idea-pad gaming laptop seriesAnother good thing is that it kinda filters the keyboard light so if you are working in low light you can keep the keyboard light to the highest and get an ambient lit up keyboard which does not feel painful to the eyes.
4,"Its okay and satisfied for the product brought for 400, initially the seller had sent a different model keyboard cover and got it replaced from amazon. The laptop is translucent and the white light from keyboard is clearly visible. Go for it if its less than or for 400."
3,"Black cover do not have laser being etched for alphabets, so backlit keyboard is of no use when the cover is put on, it keeps up with asthetic of keyboard, if you wanna see the backlit , then go for the transparent cover, but it wouldn't be asthetically pleasing but it would more practical. The tolerance/fitting is very tight .Can't comment on the durability since it is very thin. if you have access to local shops which sells similar cover better go for that it might cost you maximum of rs.200 not more."
3,"I bought this product 3 days back, this is an excellent product but doesn't justify it's price. The correct price should not be more than Rs250.I bought this keyboard cover for my lenevo IdeaPadgaming 3 and it perfectly fits it. If u are buying a keyboard cover on which keys are printed like I did then I want you to tell one thing which I didn't like is we can't see the backlight on keys but the backlight Is still visible on the keyboard background. Overall the product is good I am taking off the 2 stars because I think that the product is overpriced."
5,"Fits properly for my Legion 5 2020 model. Although the price (399) is on a higher side, it might be worth buying as the transparent cover is of good quality and you won't find it any cheaper or even available in the city you reside.So, go for it if you possess a Lenovo Legion."
5,"Can be used for Legion 5, 5 Pro & 7 (2020) & (2021) Model. Buy Transparent Keyboard Skin for RGB & White Keyboard & Black or Other Options for Regular Keyboard.Go ahead it fitted perfectly in my Legion 5 Pro 2021 model . Happy with my Purchase to stop dust from getting inside my keyboard"
2,"The product looked great in image.Goods:1.) Very thin cover2.) Fits wellBad:1.) It's a non-durable plastic used instead of well built silicone cover for this price.2.) Actual use of cover is to stop dust from entering, but being very lightweight and plastic edges it's non adhesive to laptop surface and dust enters from sides.3.) Rs.100 non-keyboard specific covers have better quality used, please use SACO brand to buy.4.) Feels very cheap in hand."
5,"Perfect fitting also for new design of IdeaPad gaming 3i . Nice , cool , classy"
4,"OK, but the back light keyboards are waste when this used. This product ruin the keyboard lighting experience, this product could be better if they use completely transparent, not that fuming color. And the letter printings over the product is opaque which also make typing in low light even in back-lit on. But it fits properly and does the job for a keyboard cover as dust and water proofing. Buy if you don't care the back lighting keyboard experience."
4,"Fits perfectly on Legion 5Pi. Thin material allows for ease in typing. Leaves no marks on screen when the lid is closed. Buy the transparent one, don't buy the black or you will not see the alphabets even on a back-lit keyboard.Highly Recommended product!!"
5,I have no doubts about the durability of the product silicones last a long time. The packaging was the best I have seen so far. The product is a bit costly it should be ₹200-300But the quality and fit is superb. So no complaints
5,"I'm using it like..from months, And It's still working perefctly!THE QUALITY IS SUPER GOOD AT THIS PRICE POINT!FREINDS I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU ARE FINDING A BEST KEY PROTECTOR AT THIS PRICE POINT SPECIALLY FOR LENOVO THEN GO FOR IT!! THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE!FITS PERFECTLY ON ""LENOVO IDEAPAD GAMING 3"" THAT'S IT HAVE A NICE DAY! ;)"
1,It's the cheapest quality available in market even polythene carry bags are more durable than thisVery overpriced not worth of 20₹alsoIt just fits keys perfectlyDon't buy in hurry  try checking for other similar products
5,"Good Product, it sticks perfectly on keyboard, doesn't move (I have a lenovo IdeaPad 3 laptop). But a small minor gap is left between laptop base and keyboard. Don't feel that dust will enter through this. I have used this for a month so will review again after some time. Also different colours are available. Definitely a must buy product for laptops."
5,There are 2 versions of this skin Previously I got the mat transparent one which is awesome & this one with black coating dosent show the characters back lit at Didn't expect this
4,When I brought it it's fit was good at some corners but some corners were not good. But after 1 day those coners also started to fit properly.the only issue is if your hand is oily or slightly wet then when you place your hand and remove it the protection also raises above a little otherwise it's fine.
1,"Doesn't fit properly , and cover was raised in some regions.Avoid , if looking for lenovo ideapad gaming 3 specifically."
5,"Laprite Keyboard Cover Skin fits perfectly fine on my Lenevo Legion 5.It’s a life saver saving keyboard from unwanted dusting. And trust me, without this product it’s very difficult to protect your laptop from dust."
2,"This product feels extremely cheap to type on. Very thin and flimsy and the only saving grace, it's colour, is done with poor finishing. It  leaves too much to be desired and you'll definitely find better things in the local market. AVOID."
4,Video Player is loading.
3,This keyboard coverskin is fine. Material quality appreciated. Could have been better. I bought it for my legion 5 pro. Fits perfectly.
5,"(I used it for my Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3)~PROS~-The material is suitable for typing.-The fitting is absolutely perfect.-The backlight is visible prominently.~CONS~-Way too expensive.ALL IN ALL, a great product. Go for it 🙌🏻"
4,Video Player is loading.
4,The best thing about is that it doesn't look like it is fitted.But the sad things is that it affects your typing experience a bit.In terms of safety it is good enough. But the price is a bit high but does its work properly.
5,"Amazing product. Perfect fitting without any sliding or getting its position shifted. It gets stuck to your keyboard and its done. As per quality, its awesome."
5,The dimensions are exact match for my laptop.overall very satisfied with the product
5,"Bought this for my Lenovo Legion 5 and it fits perfectly, the quality is also good enough."
5,It's very soft keyboard cover scene.very easy to use and washable. I used before 5 days it's very comfortable.recomonded for others.
5,Its a very decent keyboard skin and please select white one if you want your keyboard light to be visible in night because other colors won't help you.
4,"Skin is thinner, not sure how many days it lasts. Since there are no other products available for gaming pad 3i. I bought this.Does the job. Typing experience is good."
5,"I doubted it before buying... But, it's really a good product. Met my expectations. Well fitted. Not too thick to block the backlit keyboard. Not too thin to compromise on sturdiness. Perfect balance of two..."
3,It fits perfectly on the IdeaPad gaming 3 but the price is too high. You can get this in local market for 100 - 200 rs
2,Didn't properly fit. There is gap between the cover and the keys. It only fit properly at the edges.
4,Fit is decent for Legion 5 Ryzen5 model. Feel is also good. No issues
5,"Fits properly, provides good protection. Good for typing too, doesn't make the experience particularly bad.. Go for it."
2,After applying this I'm hardly able to see my keys even after turning on backlight light. So try to go for transparent guard. Else it's fine.
3,"I just think this is decent keyboard with some cool rgb features,Cons  : 1) the edges of keyboard are razor sharp and can cut your fingers sometime.2) the hand support which is provided doesn't have a good plastic hook. ( It might break soon )I received this yesterday so I will update with pros/cons sooner later"
4,"Umm.. not something I wanted as a Gaming Keyboard. I was confused between Redgear Blaze and this one.Build - 7/10-3 points for its lethal edges on the aluminium frame. It can surely pierce flesh. Rest of the keyboard is fine. Keys are good and tactical.Feel- 8/10Umm yeah kinda feel mechanical but its not practical, you totally have to press the key with perpendicular push and you might miss some keystrokes with half attempted and lousy fingers. They kinda gets stuck sideways.RGB - 10/10You cant get better than this.I wish they had one Windows Keylock LED indicator, as you cant test it in game and you cant always remember your settings as the keyboard doesn’t come with one. It resets everything after you unplug.I don’t use it anymore. :( Cant adjust it over my laptable and too much hassle for very less comfort."
1,"-First off, the front plate is coated steel, not Aluminium-Performance as a gaming keyboard is not adequate. Significant input delay-Paint on the steel is a dirt magnet-The profile of the keyboard is elevated even without the feet in the open position, which causes wrist strain over prolonged usage."
1,I thought only my keyboard had problems but if even when I replace the same product the number keypad is still not working I have to use of software to check the response it is not about the response time but  my number keypad on the right side is not working at all the second product is even worst when I replaced keyboard it's even worse then the first one...
5,"This product too much good looking and it's definitely improve your pc setup with rgb combinations.Cons : 1. The GB-GK-06  keyboard  is made by aluminum so it is too much heavier than other keyboards.  2. Truly say if you are a typer, please don't bye this product.  It's a wrost product for typing . Normal non mechanical keyboards are better than this keyboard for typing .It's to much afford to press a key.  3. The side areas are little sharp that's why if you unnecessary rough your finger in sharp areas,  you cut your fingerWhy Still It's a best gaming keyboard?1. It""s RGB function are too much impressive and best RGB combination provite you2. If you playing game nd you are a gamer , truly say please buye this product it's made for you3. GB Gk06 premium type looks provide youBenchmarkFor typing  2.8/5  looking  4.9/5  Gaming  5/5  Packaging  3.8/5"
1,im officially done it is not a mechanical keyboard and the noises are the same every cosmic byte loud weird noises whatever and it only went for like 4~5months mine broke like it started disconnecting and it never got connected back im so depressed on this if you are selling fried chipsets which only goes for 3~4months then plz stop doing buisseness plz im begging you tnx for ripping off my money which i could have bought switches for my mechanical keyboard atleast i could have got some spare switches atleast....duh 0~O
5,"it is cheap actually and cosmic byte has done very good engineering with this keyboard i'm using it from around 2/5 years and no complains to do......it works as it did from the starting...........it is also easy to clean.....i have spilled weed, rice ,dal, cheese, oil,etc........and it is new like before........it look cool when friends come by and to show off as all of us do......i love that it can change colors and bought for 1299 INR on amazon sale.......THANK YOU cosmic byte looking in forward to try out more new cheap, sturdy, fine products"
5,"The keyboard is just awesome. It is NOT a mechanical keyboard, just to be clear. I am a beginner at gaming. I didn’t have the need to buy an expensive mechanical keyboard nor did I have the budget but, I was really satisfied with the quality and performance of the product. There are many cheaper alternatives to this keyboard even by CosmicByte but I would suggest you go with this. The overall quality is great and the added feature of hand rest is just amazing. Even though the hand rest looks like it has no purpose it helps you a lot during long sessions of gaming. The only con with this keyboard is that the hand rest is removable and I really doubt the quality of the hook. Although it has been 2 months and I have removed the hand rest 3-4 times, it has no damage yet."
5,"One of the best cheapest rgb keyboard with nice color sequence combination brightness is also pleasant,look cool in darkness thrilling experience while playing games,key cap print is not that good,the font used is not good instead normal font might have look good."
5,"Placed order previous night at 9 pm received at 9 am next day!!!.The key board is great. Quality, performance at this price beats any expensive keyboards hands down believe me. The keyboard is good for fast typing also, gives a comfortable feeling. Can't believe I picked it up for 1000 bucks. I give 10 stars!!!!"
3,"as a gamer myself i would not recommend only because of the fact that it has o blue keys, the keys cant be pressed properly (ctrl key nd shift) and also it isnt an aluminum body ... the brightness is nice and the rgb features are fine. just would recommend to buy a different keyboard as im facing quiet a few issues with the keys not clicking properly (if not pushed from center gets stuck)"
4,"Bang for the buck. Has an aluminium body, braided cables and wrist rest which is plastic, be careful as you install the wrist rest as it is easy to break. Has a lot of light customisation, although no individual key lighting. Has a function where light reacts to music or any sound, thought that was pretty cool. Keys seem pretty solid, I've played valorant for a few days and has no problem with keys. Looks pretty cool with the silver aluminium finish"
4,"The body is really hard and make sure you don't hit any sensitive part from it. Its built for only table. Don't use it on lap or anything. In terms for lights, It can be modified and can work as you demand it to be. It have many modes in short. Also the typing feel is quite good and soft, Doesn't make clicks sound while you are typing from it. Would recommend to those who have table based setup only not for laptops/sofa/bed setups."
1,The light and the effects are good. But the keys are really very bad after just 3 months of use they have started getting stuck or jams out. Not what I expected of with a such a good brand. My Space key gets locked when I press it at times I have to literally pull it out to free it. Don't buy this product it's an request in your own benefit.
5,I never expected that something like this will bring a sense of joy not only to me but my kids also. They loved it. The led lights adds to thrill in gaming along with brightness. It has a good range of colours. The design is really cool.
5,"Best led keyboard out there for a tight budget10/10 lightings10/10 effects9/10 gaming10/10 build qualitykeys are soft and mushy , which makes it great for silent gaming"
5,"Its really good it has different rgb modes. I play cod, gta v and other games with it. The palm rest is really good. I would say ""BEST BUDGET KEYBOARD UNDER 2K"". Jut close your eyes and buy ot"
5,"It's very good keyboard  i ever had. The feel is amzing whenever i touch the keyboard,  it is very smooth and easy to reach the all the keys that had on the keyboard,  and in the light section it is very good!!! I liked so much about lighting feature!! I think it's very good keyboard in the range of 1300 rupess!! So thank you!!❤"
5,"The product quality is full of value for money .First impression is the last impression, keys are soft and made up of a good quality plastic , the metalic body with the colourful light feels me happy while playing games ."
5,"Okay, the product is hands down very cool for my laptop.However, it appears that the top line keys are not in sync with my keyboard keys.But I noted the pattern so it’s easy to use now. Since every laptop has a different sequence of keys, I think this standard sequence keyboard protector is still practical.Plus the product is a good keyboard protector.I’m happy with the purchase."
5,"Very cute keyboard cover . It is also washable and fits my hp x360 14"" laptop perfectly. On time delivery and good packaging."
4,Fits perfectly. On my 14 inch HP. Works wellBut was wondering what if there is spillage on the speaker above the keyboard.If you type without looking at the keyboard go for the rainbow colour one. It looks cute. Else opt for black or transparent. It has better visibility for people prone to look at their keyboards while typing. Net net purchasable.
4,"I bought the transparent versionPros :Perfect fitBacklit keys appears more astheticTotally value for moneyCons :Some of the keys like space bar are a little bit not packed quite perfectly . But over all , all of the keys are tensly packedSo should you buy it or not?Definately if you want in this price segement . But if you can raise your budget a little then you can go for a better one . In my opinion you should definitely give it a try."
5,"This product is a must buy. It keeps your keyboard protection and if it gets dirty, it can be cleaned and dried and re-applied again. Now, I don't have to worry about sanitizing my keyboard directly when I can just wash the cover. Makes the cleanliness freak in me very happy."
5,I have seen similar product with transparent and black color at this price range. I would say no keyboard cover is giving value for money. compared to all this one gives nice rainbow look and if you want to purchase only on online then it will be a good option.
5,"Well this makes my boring laptop come alive..!!!! Now I feel like working just looking at my keyboard 🙂 . The fit is precisely perfect. No problem is closing the lid, stays intact. Very beautiful."
5,Looks lovely and perfect match for 14 inch Hp laptop  .. safe for laptop.
3,I have ordered after seeing some reviews in Amazon. But the top line of screenguards are mismatched with letters. Power off button also missing in guard. Requesting you to kindly check and fix this issue
4,The keypad cover fits perfectly on my HP 14s-fq1029AU. The adhesion is good and I'm having no problem in typing. The color is very pretty and adding to the overall esthetics.
5,it makes the laptop look reallly nice
5,"Exactly fit to my hp i5 14"" laptop. I liked it."
4,The fit was good however in got different print on function keys .  Keys print from f5 Shifted one key . That's the mistake . Just in some time the part from the Spacebar key is not sticking.
4,"Perfectly fits my HP 14"" laptop. But bit pricy."
5,Recommended.
5,excellent
3,"Product is Nice, but not comfortable hp laptop pavilion keyboard 14 inch (14-dv0054TU)."
2,"Function keys are not printed at approximat place.this cover may mostaken the work done on the laptop, as you think something and something else will happen."
5,Loved it

5,"Best product to go for….Super thin, amazing texture….Simply loved it"
5,"Worth the price,, Fit is perfect.. amterial is good.. easy to use in night as well.. perfect blend of colors"
5,This eye pleasing product has made my work from home little interesting. Thank you for making such products.
5,It completely fit my laptop keyboard. Nice color. Good quality. Prefer everyone to buy.
5,Fits perfectly and looks so cool.. Love it..
5,Perfectly fits my 14 inch HP pavilion laptop...and got it delivered 2 days early...I'm satisfied with the product.
5,"It's (near)perfect.Initial impressions(3 days of use) -Has enough travel and feedback on from the keys - they're far better than my laptop's keyboard.Works with UbuntuThe paint on the keys is solid matte black, doesn't scratch/pick fingerprints/get dirty easily, fonts are clear and legible.Has controls for brightness(3 levels) and dedicated Backlight on/off key(keys aren't evenly lit, but that's not a deal breaker for me)Learnt to 90% touch type in 2 days(Didn't touch type before, now I do!)I ordered it as I found this to be the cheapest non-RGB backlit option - the closest one was a Logitech costing 2.5k, which is way out of reach for me. This turned out to be a great purchase."
3,"I ordered this product few months back. But due to lockdown it's shipping stopped midway and my order got returned. After lockdown I placed the order again. After receiving the product, I got quite excited to see a backlit keyboard at just around Rs.800. But as I tried typing something the keyboard just wobbled like anything. I then realized that the bottom surface of the keyboard is uneven. All the four legs (I don't know what to call them) don't touch my table surface at the same time. Since it has been around 3 months that I have been trying to get this keyboard on my hand, I had no mood of returning it and waiting for another to arrive. I instead taped some thermocol under the shorter leg (shown in the pic).The typing feels decent enough. The backlit is good. It has 3 brightness levels. The KB doesn't feel premium at all. Also, there is no dedicated button for media controls. Simply to increase or decrease the volume (which is the highest used media controls) you would need two hands, as because, the distance between the FN key and the volume keys are far enough to comfortably control it with a single hand. It'd have been better if the FN key could have been toggled (ON/OFF). This feature can still be possible to provide through a software.Altogether the experience was bitter than sweet. But, getting used to it day by day. I hope Fingers take my points into consideration. I still appreciate them for providing a backlit KB at such a minimal price point."
3,"I bought this keyboard a couple of months back because it was the cheapest backlit keyboard available on Amazon India. Expected it to be great. Sadly it was just okay. The backlights do work wonderfully. But the keys themselves get stuck and are sometimes hard to press.Not recommended for people who would type a lot.It's okay for gaming, not that great.It's great for light use at night.If you're looking for a keyboard on which you would type a lot then go for a cheaper non-backlit dell or Logitech keyboard."
5,"Using Extensively from last 12 days1. White Backlit  : A great eye cooling effect  much more better than malty color rubbish costly ketboard2. Full size keyboard : No need for woory3. Backlit with 3 brightness label  Using the Fn+Page up/Down key combinations4. MOST ECONOMICAL - : UNDER 900 Rs. nobody expect this much quality5. Switch on off is very simple - in day time is can be off - in night time it can be turn ON6. I ALREADY REFER 6 FRIENDS to try this keyboard7. Yes, I remember the SONG of MD RAFI SAAB'S  '' CHAUDHVI KA CHAND '' -- WHICH IS PERFECT TO DESCRIBE THE VALUE AND PROS of this amazing father touch SILENT MEMBER of my FAMILY"
3,Only issues i had with this product was it that :-1. Made a lot of noise specially the space bar. Couldn't bear it.2. Some of the button had to pressed right at its center to actually work else it would get some what get stuck and do not read the I/O (sort of mechanical board)Best part was its backlit. controlled and very good to work at night time. Also one can set the backlit levels. Kudos for this at such price.
3,Not a bad product. Lights are nice but misses something for me. Light are fractionally unevely lit & lighted portion lacks minor finishing that lies below blackened keys. Felt little above average to me but not awesome. Doesnt feel like a keyboard of a premium brand for me. Just personal preferences.
4,Good keyboard. The one i received does not look like images shown on amazon. So i misunderstood it as a normal keyboard. Then I got replaced it with same keyboard later on i figured it out that u have to press scroll button to light the keyboard. Keyboard is smooth and every thing is working well.
2,"I bought this backlit keyboard for smooth typing in the dark. The back lighting is good, however the keys are clunky and tend to get stuck or do not get pressed with normal typing pressure. This just kills your typing speed and many letters get missed leading to total chaos. I am throwing this keyboard out and replacing it with a good one that allows me to type smoothly."
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"Best keyboard with backlit for this price. Made in China but Fingers is a new Indian company with some new innovative products. The backlit has 3 brightness level, which can be controlled via Fn+Pg Up/Down keys. Also it can be turned off using the lights (sun symbol next to Fn key) key. Overall very happy with this purchase."

5,"VERY CLEAR BACKLIT, earlier I used Cooler Master backlit keyboard, the backlit LEDs were blue and were less visible and that stopped working in a very short duration. But Fingers Magnifico Moonlit Backlit Wired USB Keyboardis working fine so far"
4,"This is what I needed !!Simple moon bklit, minimal noise, key denounce/mechanical feel good. Coding during night time feels good with this keyboard 🤘Improvement: key bcklit does not feel even, that may be bcoz of during spray/brush painting over key light emitting area of key is also getting coloured/brushed bit.But this just improvement not bloker for thos who want to purchase.Definately go for it, worth every penny !"
4,Minor issues like paint quality etc do exist but frankly they don't matter. Can conveniently use this in a dark room without weird coloured back-lit - white is simply better than other colours. Good quick access keys etc. Keys press much like a laptop - which is better for those who're used to laptops vs typewriters (I prefer this). Could've been a little curved and could've had a right-click/context menu button - that's my only complaint.
1,"Look at the picture, that too in just 4-5 months of usage.. need I say more. Even though I can still work on it due to typing experience my kid who has to do online classes can't and I have a buy a new one. Keys also routinely get stuck. Avoid this product like the plague. I'm appalled that it still has an Amazon Choice listing, that is just deceitful."
5,"If you are looking for these features, just go ahead and buy this keyboard. Dell and other Chiclet keyboards are not only costly but stand nowhere compared to the tying experience of this keyboard. The backlit feature is what I was manily looking for, but I got a lot more than that. Beautiful keyboard this is."
5,- SUPERB KEYS- GREAT BACK-LIGHT WITH BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT- GREAT KEYBOARD FOR TYPING FOR LONG HOURS AND FOR FAST TYPING AS WELL- EXCELLENT BUILD- I ALSO TESTED FOR TYPING EFFICACY USING A TYPING TEST AND MY TYPING SPEED WAS ALMOST AT PAR WITH A REGULAR KEYBOARD.
5,"If you work in dark rooms, buy this. But, if you have no light issue, go for HP or Dell keyboard. I am live in a dark room. So, I bought this. And its quality is pretty good. The lighted keyboard was looking gorgeous. This keyboard is low-sounded. The keys were very smooth and did not get dirty easily. So, if you want to buy this for light purpose, just go and buy it."
3,"I am a software developer and I need to work night shifts, so a keyboard with a backlight was a must for my use. I was using a laptop integrated keyboard, but I was not more comfortable doing typing for long hours due to its small size (14'' laptop). So after searching I found the only non-RGB backlit keyboard on the internet. I purchased it and after using it for around a month, the only con which I experience in this keyboard is that keys are hard to press compared to branded keyboards available. I have used Dell, HP and Logitech keyboards. they are far better at typing compared to this keyboard, but none of them offers white backlit. So, no option other than this. Else it's not a bad deal at this price."
5,Great product. Go for it. I use it for gaming and it works well. I got it at a price that seemed slightly higher but I have a good product that works to expectations. Keys are soft and yet sturdy. Backlight works with three different brightness levels. Highly satisfied as of now.
5,solves the purpose and soft keysyou can get any baclite keyboard at this price so no need to cry about quality.still it is perfectly working and led brightness is perfect. i found keys are too soft else i am using everyday since 3 months. and working like charm
1,"Lookwise and keys wise, it's very good. It worked quite well for nearly 2.5 months. Suddenly some of the keys getting jammed and hence there are too many characters that get typed without even touching any key. I didn't expect that it would malfunction within 3 months. Definitely, it's not worth to buy it."
4,"I like it’s flexibility and the detachable keyboard (which has a really long battery life, I don’t remember the last time I charged it). The grooves to balance the screen aren’t deep so it slips sometimes if your using it without the keyboard and just watching something on the screen. But all in all, it’s useful. The look and finish is average, and the edges do tear off a little after a while."
2,Though the cover is okey but it's Keyboard that has gone Dead in a month. It is not charging. The red light - indicator of charging - is no more working when connected to charger. It's absolutely nonsenical to pay Rs. 2000/= for an average cover.
5,Perfect fit for ipad (7th or 8th generation). Delivery was prompt. Quality is good.
5,This is perfect keyboard combo. Although it adds to the weight what I like is that it connects perfectly with my 8th generation iPad just connected it initially it always connects when on. Battery life is the winner almost more then a week
1,Not a right casing for the iPad 2019 10.2 model.There are issues with:- fitting the iPad and- misalignment of buttons & headphone jack socket.
3,"Overall sturdy and good design to protect the cam in back. But the cover is heavier than tablet itself which is highly disappointing.The keyboard is very good, light weight. As it is not permanently attached it can be used seperately for any product.If you are not worried about weight then it is best"
3,Value for what you payKeyboard is of decent quality (dont compare with apple one which costs around 13k)ipad looks bulky and often fall down without keyboard (if you attend video conference)Keyboard doesnt sticks well in the case (magnetic power is very low)
2,"Product is so fragile certainly it will not more take more than few rough taps on the keyboard, it will give in to non usable condition. More over the cover is loose and looks quite odd,  spoils the look of your ipad. I had to return the product as it was tampered. Very sure that this product is overpriced.  Better for amazon to have a quality checking department/section to look into these kind of products. Quite a bad experience."
2,The keyboard was fine when I bought it in feb 2020 now it’s June 2020 and alreadyY half keys are not working I am unable to return it
1,After using it for 2 months the keyboard has stopped working. Also the case is too heavy. I bought this by considering it's cheap price but it's totally bogus. Kindly consider other options.
1,The cover is so slippery if I rest the iPad in the 2nd slot it slips and falls down. Mounting quality is not good.The quality is not as per expectation. After looking into the video - it had a different assumption.the keyboard quality is not good. Day one the connect button got pressed inside now my keyboard is always connected.Disappointed after purchasing.
4,The look and feel as well as finish are nice but the main part slips out of the groove if the keyboard is removed. Not ideal to use this as a stand without the keyboard.
4,"Great Value for the Price. iPad fits perfectly, good build and nice magnetic bluetooth keyboard. Decent keys and typing action. Only drawback is that when you close the case, the iPad screen touches the keys. So it’s not that practical. Don’t store the pad in the case without a buffer. Design could have been more intuitive."
1,It’s a waste of product. It does not match Apple iPad 7 Gen as mentioned.
3,Looks good.don't expect it to work like the original one.
5,Excellent product
2,The keyboard does not have back light as shown in image - false information to sell product - not good
5,A great product for the iPad 7. It is very sturdy and build quality looks like it will last for a long time.
3,It does the work of securing your iPad and making it work little laptop.only minus point is that the case is heavy and it's slips off without keypad.
5,Very nice product comfortable for typing and the cover holds the ipad well in the landscape mode as mentioned best product
5,The ipad becomes heavy! Otherwise extremely good product.Can use cover without keypad too. Quality of the case is excellent. And keypad bluetooth connection is very easy
5,"Value of money. Working fine with my ipad 8th gen. The keyboard can be connected with any device can be used seperately as well. Keys are functioning well in laptop ipad, android tab as well as mobile phone. Case is also permium. Can go for it."
3,"Case itself is very heavy so ... can’t use for daily use , most of the keys except alphabets are for show not doin anything ... except for that it’s good"
2,The inside package was opened. Seem to be a rejected piece. I have kept it as it's working fine.
5,Very smooth and effective keyboard n cover for ipad 8th generation
4,"Fits perfectly to 10.2"" iPad, Value for money and keyboard feels a little heavy and must apply screen guard for iPad when the cover is used with the keyboard. Case with keyboard when folded may lead to scacthes on ipad screen."
4,Good product. Would have been better if it was a bit sturdier and aesthetic.
4,Value for money.. 👍🏼 Quality can be better.. So far it's been doing it's job well
1,Only 4buttons on keypad is working... waste of money..I will return the product..
5,Best keyboard/case option for 7th gen ipad
5,Excellent product! Highly recommended. Fits perfectly on the keys of the laptop. The alphabets printed on the black skin are as clear as the actual keypad. Typing is just as convenient with the skin mounted on the keypad. Only concern is that over a period of time the skin should not leave any imprints on the screen when the screen is closed after usage.
5,Although it's a little expensive the product is definitely worth itIt fits perfectly and has great sheernessThe only problem that might be is it makes the fingerprint scanner redundant but otherwise the product is of great quality and fits well on the laptop
4,"in the box you would get 2 different length protectors which you could cut and fit your touchpad. 1 was very small for my laptop but the other worked well after cutting.The product is very good, gestures work well with it. worth it."
5,"The Fireblade keyboard is the best. Its a TKL keyboard. Saves a lot of space ony desk and looks nice. Typing experience is a breeze, gives a mechanical vibe. The keys are elevated too to give it a mechanical keyboard look and it gives a lot of travel to the keys. Gives off loud typing noises. Made of sturdy abs plastic. Weights about 350 grams but most of that comes from a metal plate inside the keyboard. Finishing of the keyboard is not that good. The key cap fonts looks muddy and not professional. And below the keys that's sprayed paint splotches which does not look good when the lights are on. Speaking of lights there is just 7 LEDs places at the bottom.of the keyboard that's it. You cannot program them. Just static LEDs.Coming.to the mouse. Its called spirit and it was not in the market earlier unlike the keyboard. Its not sold separately nd is exclusive to this combo pack. Very good quality. Strong build. Has a dedicated software using which you can maP the keys adjust the light etc..looks very decent.To see the full review of this keyboard search for my youtube channel 'Life Reviewed'"
4,First impression:Got delivered within 2 days. The packaging was good.First keyboard:The keyboard is made of hard plastic. Has a sturdiness to it. Appropriate weight. Keys can be removed and replaced or cleaned. Has a mechanical feel. Saves space due to numpad less design.  It's the same size of ur average laptop keypad. Played some games and feels good.Two option for RGB. Breathing and steady. Breathing timing can be altered. Rgb intensity can be varied.Mouse:The spirit Mouse is exclusive only with this combo. It's a good Mouse with a weight to it.Rgb and mouse buttons (6 buttons) can be programmed using software.Overall in this price range I would recommend it solely due to the space Saving design.I researched all the keyoards within this price range including zebronics and cosmic byte and I don't regret my decision to buy this hardware.
5,Ordered this combo as an addition to work and personal use. I have fairly large hands but it is still comfortable to use the set. Doesn't occupy much space on my 52 inch (horizontal) work desk. You cannot change the rgb lights on the keyboard. Only two options - breathing and static. Good purchase at this range. Even the official amkette site has the same price. Bought from Amazon only for the points and prime delivery
5,This deal was so cool. Works great as advertised. Such a low price for what feels and looks like quality. I can not get over the keyboard. It feels like it would last forever. The mouse fits snugly in my hand and works great. I do not have a lot of space allowed to me to work or play. so this works great. Takes away from the dullness of my setup. Thanks guys.
5,"the keyboard is compact and has a mechanical feel to it, the mouse is amazing  with it's new design and built quality is perfect. sturdy and solid. the keyboard is fun for typing but the only complaint is the keys wobble a lot , apart from this it's just amazing"
1,"Built quality is good But Quality check in messing.got key Board with some letters not working,over all liked the product and finally decided to get refund as cannot trust it any more after 2nd replacement."
1,The internals of the mouse are probably broken or misplaced because it makes a rattling noise when I use it due to which the buttons and the mouse itself don't work properly.
5,I bought this keyboard and mouse for my son and he looooooves it!!!! I just love how the keyboard and mouse both has breathing light effect.  it’s just amazing!! Very well worth buying.
3,"Keys don't function properly in the keyboard . One key doesn't even work for me . And talking about mouse, its okay-ish . I know in this budget this maybe good but atleast the keys should function properly"
3,Overall it's a great keyboard and mouse but some of the computer can't handle this keyboard. This made my computer crash and made it slow so if you buying this pls make sure you have powerfull computer.
5,Worthy of money
5,"This keyboard skin fits perfectly on Pavilion 15 Gaming Laptop, mine specifically is ec0101ax, although it will fit on any laptop in this series.It has just the right amount of adhesion. It won't come off during normal usage of the keyboard or unless you intentionally try to remove it.The thickness is also perfect. Typing feels smooth and had no instance where the key press was not registered.It is also transparent and backlight will be visible when turned on. However, the Caps Lock notification light won't be visible even though the have provided a hole specifically for it."
5,"Fitted perfectly on my HP Pavilion Gaming 15. It's thin, but that's the beauty of it. It shouldn't put pressure on the screen when closed. Perfect fit to size and all the keys match. Good job from Saco!"
5,It is really nice product. Nice quality. I have been using this for a month now it is great. It is a little smaller than my keyboard but no issue as I knew it will come in a smaller size as the laptop has large keyboard. Great product not even a scratch on it even though i have long nails. There is no refund policy so please check length of the keyboard. You not get a cover like this at this price. Value for money. And yes it is jon adhesive. Does not stick. Great aspect.
5,"Pros:It is a perfect fir for HP gaming pavilion laptop.It's slim as well so, screen doesn't touch the keyboard skin.Con: the key symbols are opaque and white colored. So, it's not possible to work in dark with the cover on. (Which is not a major issue for me)"
5,"Fits several laptops of hp perfectly.  Although the Capslock light hole is a bit lower than on laptop,  the keyboard protector is of perfect size and looks good as well"
2,"The material is good and the has good sheerness. The only drawback in the cover is that the characters are barely visible when the backlit is turned on in the dark. So, if anybody likes to work at night in dark, then I believe it's not really helpful."
5,It is worth of buying it and you can go with it and it is washable too ..... Good product....I am satisfied with it
5,perfect fit! Got it for Rs. 307
5,The product is amazing and was totally worth it. But surely while buying do check the keys of the protector because one of my relative bought it randomly and then realised that the protector was short for the keyboard
5,"Easy to install, safeguards the Keyboard from dust and from any fluids falling accidentally on it. Easy to clean as well..."
4,"Pros- Very thin and looks premium. Adhesion is good, it doesn't move from its place unless I want to.Cons- The light on the caps lock key is not visible through the cover."
4,It's a better keyboard protector for hp pavilion 15. Major con is caps lock indicator which is not visible. It would have been better if the letters are transparent instead of white.
3,"Cover is ok however backlight does not pass through keys, just backlights at the side are visible. Also not good for typing.Only good thing is it protects the keyboard from dust. And also fits fine on the keyboard."
4,Fits perfectly on my hp laptop.Feels like there isn't any cover on the keyboardIt has only one problem that the caps lock and silent key indicator light are not clearly visible through this.
5,Very great quality very much satisfied go for it!!
4,Great product. It's good than traditional old transparent cover in look. Perfect adjusted with my laptop.One thing to be improved is it should be little adhesive at the edge and corner for better grip.
1,"The quality of the keyboard and mouse are too good. In this combo keyboard was not working due to which i had to return the product, for this reason i am giving 1 star or else i would have given 5 star. If possible check it before delivering to the customers."
5,At Rs799 this combo is super. The nano receiver is inside the mouse. Many are complaining that it is not in the package. Built quality is very good. Product is brand new Aug 2019 @Rs1799/-
4,"It took 4 long days to reach me under 'Amazon Prime'. Seller took 2 days to pack, which is just rolling some kitchen wrap around it!, Mine came intact but other people's complaint about packing is true. Keyboard/Mouse is solid, very good build quality plastic. Mouse emits red light at the bottom  (its not laser- LED) Mouse has an ON/OFF switch at the bottom. Mouse is fairly accurate,DPI switch works like a charm!. I like the scroll wheel also, Its little on the stiffer side but i like it!. I am not a fan of the chocolate keys and its travel much in an usage perceptive but its written on the description so no complaints. Keys looks great and feels premium, there is no visible gap around the keys. The cover also says the product is build in 2019!. Comes with 2 AAA + 1 AA duracell batteries. I recommend this product for the price!."
3,"Generally I do not write reviews, but I wanted to help my fellow programmers who are looking for a wireless keyboard.Pros:The keyboard is beautiful, and connects like a charm. Does not require any installation or admin rights on the machine. There is no lag whatsoever between keypresses and mouse clicks. The controls are good, and mouse sensitivity can be controlled by DPI switch. The range is good, and mouse works perfectly on most surfaces, including bed. So, you can go to bed when you are watching a movie, and control the Screen.Cons:The KEYS.iBall is marketing the 'chocolate' keys on this keyboard as if it is an advantage/feature. But in my opinion, they are a drawback. Keys must be pressed from center, else they get stuck, and do not get pressed. This is specially with the large keys, like Enter, Space,tab, caps lock. .  you get the idea. Also, they are a bit hard to press. Overall, typing is not best feeling on this keyboard. I have been using this for more than a week, but still the keys are hard, and I guess they intend to remain so.PS: If your job requires continuous and a lot of typing, don't go for it. For everyone else, who requires a wireless input method, this is the best buy at this price."
1,"One star coz it cann't go below this.The packing was very poor, simply wrapped in plastic.Mouse was not working and also the 'shift' key on the keyboard was stucked.I had to go to the service centre the very same day I recieved the product."
1,"After doing research i came across this combo.Initially i was thinking of just buying just wireless mouse but after doing some research ifound that cost of wireless mouse was around 600 to 700 so instead of that i thought of purchasing this combo which costs just 900.Now coming to main point-as this product is from iball i was bit skeptic about this  as i am using logitech which whorks as charm even after 20 years.So gave this thing a try as there were many good reviews. after using this product for about 3 days i found tha the product is really good whether its keyboard or the mouse.Though the mouse can't be said silent but its normal in this price .i received the product in good condition and it is same as the description is provided.The keyboard has all the keys which is required in a keyboard and the mouse has 4 keys with the small black key is for dpi adjustments.The scroll is really smooth and the mouse fits my palm perfectly.The build quality is also good in this price range. It's comaptible with every product(smart tv phone laptop,desktop,etc.)Its major drwback is that there is no power button in keyboard which means it will continusioly drain power,though its very less.Just for this i gave this thing 4 star.That's it. Will provide upadtes after long term usage.I wrote this review using the keyboard only.Thank you.Edit 1:just after 3 days the shift key got stuck inside the keyboard.Tried many times to rectify the problem but it was of no use.So atlast returned the product.Now typing this edit from the logitech MK235.You will find the detailed review of this keyboard on that product page.So i will recommend to go for logitech products instead of other brands."
5,"I was very sceptical about this product...... I brought it only ₹ 799/- , in this price point a keyboard mouse combo is unavailable right now (wireless) . Mouse is handy , not too large and not too small , keys are smooth , doesn't produce click click sound ...  Full size with dedicated caps lock , and num lock indicators ...... everything in this super price 🤩🤩"
1,"The Keyboard is not working, i have ordered this item along with CPU unit.But, key board was delivered on 4th october 2019, the cpu was delivered on 11th oct 2019. we have assembled the set on last weekend 20th October because the PC was ordered to some rural village, and found that mouse is working and keyboard is not working.I have contacted to customer service, they said to accepted for the replacement in the chat. But, the item was not picked up. Later two days, again I have tried to contact the customer executive. She said we don’t have any provisions for replacement, and we will not accepted. And she is very rude, worst behaviour and disconnected my call."
5,Very very good.. by iball... Bcz this is my first home wireless keyboard and mouse. Mouse 🔋 backup is very good.. whisle we are not using (standby mode) mouse connection is closed (disconnected) and turn offthen when we click any button on mouse then after restarted and connected l. Its awesome product in Rs. 799.....i have reviewed after many month of used....Thank you amazon.. And thank you so much Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.
5,"Every thing is fine. When I received it, the mouse was open at the bottom and I just pressed it.  . Now it is working fine. Connectivity is good. It turns off itself both mouse and keyboard when we are not using. By pressing any key on keyboard will wake up keyboard and clicking on mouse wakes up it. So far so good"
1,"Dear all,Was super excited for my keyboard. While using I found that the ‘-‘ key on num pad was not working properly. To access such key I had to exercise extra pressure on that particular key which was little disheartening. Have requested for sending the same back.Why strict control is not exercised while selling a product through online means? Why unnecessary cause discomfort for customers and make him hesitant for buying something next time?"
2,"It is average in quality and okay for daily use. The keys are not comfortable as dell keyboard. Mouse is good and works perfectly.The mouse will turn off if you don't use it for couple of minutes. Turning on the mouse is not like other brands, you have to left click other wise it wont turn on. Auto turn off function of keyboard is annoying. This cause lot of issue in 3d application and graphic designing. The keyboard wont respond until you press any key two times. Big disaster if you use it in multimedia works. I don't know how it is going to perform in gaming."
1,The Keyboard given to me is defective and it types q when I press enter button.
1,"This keyboard duo is waste of money, mouse is average but keyboard is absolutely worthless if you want to use it for more than 10 minutes. Keys stuck and if you press anywhere except exact middle of it they wont work. Gives pain in finger after some time. I had to purchase other keyboard and wasted my money on this one.Not at all recommended. better buy a renowned brand paying a little more."
5,"No setup hassles. Tried it on Windows and Linux both - worked flawlessly.Received it a couple of days ago, so cannot comment on battery life.Update after 1 month of use: Battery life is good. Both Key board and Mouse go into Power Saving mode if not used for a few minutes. This prolongs the battery life."
5,"Best at this price- Good build quality- Just 1 AAA battery for keyboard and 1 AAA for mouse, super isnt it- Mouse is really comfortable and sturdy- I've also used it with android TV works niceDown side -- Keyboard keys stuck when typing fast, but keep the price in mind and dont compare with 2000 rs keyboard mouse- When using with android tv due to distance of operation, it find problem in sending mouse movement, but i understand to save battery range is kept low and mouse and keyboard both are able to work with just 1 AAA battery each.If you want to type at very fast speed such as programmer, will not be happy with keys. I rarely need to type fast so, i can compromise for this price tag.Overall i am very happy for regular usage."
1,"3rd iBall purchase that disappoints me. First the speakers, then the mouse and now the keyboard and mouse combo. The left click of the mouse doesn't work. They will only send a replacement and not refund. Lets see how the replaced product works now. The keyboard and mouse, both need to be turned off after use, which i am sure everyone is going to forget. Logitech K260 doesn't need turning off and i haven't replaced the batteries since more than 6 months now. This will cost you only 200 rs more. Not happy with iBall."
2,First day it didn't show any problem. Things work fine.Form the second day I noticed that the mouse becomes inactive/non-responsive time to time. In the picture one can see that the light is not glowing even if the switch is on. Rubbing or clicking it won't start the mouse again. I needed to turn it off and on to resume working.The keyboard also showed problem. The navigation keys got stuck. Sometimes keyboard became non responsive.The combination is cheap but not for robust and prolonged use.Got the item on 11th jun 2020.Returned on 16th jun 2020.
1,"I am writing this review after 8-9 months of use, mouse stopped working completely, It has started making trouble from 2-3 months, now completely stopped working, keyboard is in same condition, keys are hard to press, many times not works in single press. I bought this in 900 but when compared to product quality its not worth the money.  cheap quality product."
2,Go for a better keyboard.- There is a good amount of lag from keypress to actual response.- The range is very very low. Not even 1-meter distance.- Mouse turns off automatically after some time to save power. But 9 out of 10 times it does not turn on when trying to move the mouse. You have to manually turn it off using the button below and turn it on again like 2 or 3 times to turn on the mouse.Keyboard and mouse looks good and is cheap. But functionality vise a big ZERO !!!
1,"Many keys have stopped working on the keyboard within 4 months.  When I discussed the matter with Amazon on chat I was advised to contact iBall. They donot answer the phone calls as their ""representatives are busy at the moment"". You will hear this recorded message at all times. In an email iBall asked me to return the product at their service centre. They say they dont have onsite warranty. Service centre told me that replacement will take 15-20 days after I submit keyboard+mouse at their centre.Very POOR service . I am not buying any iBall product from now on.  I am giving 1 star rating because the option to give 0 star rating doesnot seem to be there."
5,"I use this product with my laptop as my hands were more frequent on desktop keyboard, hence I purchased it for using with my laptop. It is working fine with my hp pavilion laptop and the wireless mouse is also working great for more than six months, the only drawback is the battery chamber's cover is very fragile and light weight, so in time of changing battery of mouse it may break very easily. Mine has been broken but still working now, otherwise the product is excellent but price tag should be 200 - 300/- less than whatever amazone is charging. Delivery of the product is on time and good quality batteries are included both for mouse and keyboard. Overall I am satisfied with this produce except mouse battery cover issue and high price of the product."
1,"Pathetic product, actually blaming a product won't do justice as I had a hell lot of research on YouTube reviews and with my laptop accessories friend which was very positive, I problem is with Amazon this time and For the first time I m very disappointed my Amazon. The USG device was so that it was bit tight and when I pushed slightly it went it but was not working and it also damaged by laptop which costed me even more than this device, now I want refund not exchange which is not possible here. I m trying contacting customer care but can't get through dem. But guys belive me this product is good."
5,"Recieved it within 2 days. As usual best delivery by amazon.The package contains: 1 Keyboard, 1 Mouse, 1 nano receiver, 3 batteries [2 in KB and 1 in mouse]FOR THOSE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT RECEIVING NANO RECEIVER... IT IS IN BATTERY SECTION OF MOUSE.The product is great! KB looks sleek and stylish. Keys are smooth. No problems.The mouse comes with adjustable DPI with 3 speeds.Best thing i loved about this mouse is, it automatically switches to power saver mode after 10 mins of inactivity. To turn it on, you simply have to click left or right button.Overall, GREAT PRODUCT!!"
2,Mouse is having problem just with in 4 weeks ... the cursor stuck at time and makes difficult to move to specific place on the screen.
5,"I purchased this wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo in May 2020 and since then I have not faced any issues.Both Keyboard and Mouse come with batteries. Initially the keys on Keyboard were little hard but in 2-3 weeks time they got easy and very comfortable in typing. Mouse also working fine, it goes into sleep mode automatically if you don't use it for few minutes and  it becomes active when pressed left click. There is no such option for keyboard.Only issue I found is the keys are bit noisy while typing, apart from this its perfect product at this price. I recommend this product to buy."
5,"The product is good. Had received one where the mouse stopped working had the unit replaced, the replacement item works like a charm so no complaints there. Feel like the build could be a little more better, the keyboard raises are a little small and hence the incline is not suitable for someone who does a lot of typing. But otherwise the keyboard and mouse is a must have for the wireless comfort..Feel could be a little cheaper, but thanks to the demand for it due to Work From Home situation, can't expect the price to be cheaper."
2,"At first I was satisfied with the keyboard but after a few months, I have noticed that something strange is happening. Sometime it actually types the same characters twice and you end up pressing backspace again and again. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.A poor choice from my end. Not a long lasting for sure. A waste of money. Go for Logitech or Dell or HP instead. iBall is no match to them as of yet.You get what you pay for."
1,Mouse is not working properly after 40 days of use. I changed & inserted new batteries still there is an issue with the mouse. I cannot return it bcos Iball has a return period of 10 days. It was working perfectly all this time. But all of sudden Mouse does not click properly single click becomes double click. Selected content gets automatically unselected. Really Sad. Its not about the money. I trusted the Brand Iball which disappointed me.
4,Excellent.The initial piece which was delivered to me had a faulty mouse. The clicks on the mouse were very hard and the right click was not even function. Looked like they shipped a faulty mouse. My idea of buying this was to save USB slot which was not serving the purpose.I placed a replacement of the entire order (tried to place replacement of only the mouse but that option was not available). Within two days it was replaced and the replaced part is awesome.... Keyboard is smooth and neat. The mouse is very fast and the movements of them mouse is very smooth and enjoyable.Mistakes happen but what I like is acknowledging of it and taking quick action to keep the customer happy.Finally ended with a good experience of the service and the product. Now I have one USB slot free for my other use.
1,The keyboard's keys won't even last a month. All the keys are fading. The first battery didn't last a month too. Let's see how the new battery would last (will give you an update). Also after a months use the keys are making noise and it's very annoying!!!The mouse is very delicate. Unfortunately it fell off from 2 feet and now the scroll button does not work. I am now using a wired mouse!! You
3,"- Firstly, the cost is reasonable.- The mouse is good for me, its small size and I was used to such a size since long time. Mainly that was one of the reason for buying this one.- The keyboard is not at all comfortable to type.. it makes lots of noise too..... Well I didn't like the keyboard a bit.- Regarding the battery, it comes with battery for both mouse and keyboard.- More bad about keyboard - the keyboard battery got drained within a month of use. I am not a heavy coding/typing, mostly team mgmt so fairly average keyboard user. So can't believe it got drained in 1-month time. They could have provided with 3cells or AA cells if its so bad!!- Mouse battery is still working after a month use, not sure how long it'll work. It'll actually auto off mouse if not used for few minutes(not sure for how long), you need to click a button on the mouse to re-enable it. I liked this one :)- Finally, there is a switch to turn off mouse. But there isn't any switch for the keyboard, another bad point for keyboard.Thanks"
2,"Thought of purchasing Logitech, but since this was priced very low (50% off), I couldn't resist.Both keyboard and mouse looks stylish, and sturdy.Keyboard is very comfortable to use,I found mouse tumbling a little on even surface, not quite sure what is the reason might be it's bottom cushion aren't stocked right.That's the only reason I have rated 4 otherwise it's 5 🌟 product.Updated after using for more than a year:Reduced to 🌟🌟 as mouse stopped workingAnd keyboard started feeling little hard.Again I should have bought Logitech, regret this purchase as I hate generating e-waste."
5,"No connectivity issues. Just plug in the usb and you are ready to go. I use it on my windows Computer. Works like a charm. The drivers/install_files are installed automatically in the first time connection. No batteries are provided inside the box. Its just the keyboard and the mouse. Its actually best for people who don’t do much gaming and heavy stuff. I use it for my office work and yes its very durable and value for money. And its from iBall, so the build quality is up to the mark at this price point."
1,"Mouse doesn't work properly. Its light goes off even when the switch is on. So, you have to reset it 4-5 times to make sure the light stays on for some time. Also, if not used for 5 minutes the mouse becomes inactive and you to again reset it 4-5 times so that it starts working again.Keyboard is not as smooth as one would like. It makes noise and within one month some keys have started getting stuck (I have used the keyboard for around 8-10 hours everyday for office work).I am not sure if both the keyboard and mouse would be functional for at least 1 year.Even though iBall is an Indian company, this product was made in China, so probably that explains about the quality.Summary - Product not recommended."
5,"I bought this product for my laptop. The ergonomic design is really very great and comfortable. I loved it that the keys are easily pressed. It makes it very easy to type. Especially when you are a coder or a content writer or own a website and are continuously updating the website with new posts. I am Co-founder of a tech website and consistently have to update it with new gadgets that are entering the market. This product really makes it very easy for me to keep writing. The buttons are very soft to press. The durability is good. It is very comfortable for typing and helps you to keep your pace. Even the mouse is very good and fits perfectly in your palm. I have also played a lot of games using this mouse. The response time is decent and good if you are a beginner level gamer. The small button below the scroller helps you to adjust the speed of the cursor as you move the mouse (dpi).I have faced no issue with this product yet.  However, will update it if I do. Also, will mention the solution for the same.In all, this product has not disappointed me so far. I am pretty sure it won't."
1,"Excellent build quality on the keyboard,  pathetic build quality on the mouse. The product design on the keyboard is so bad that when you use it for prolonged period of time your fingers start to pain due to the keys and the keys are kind of sticky and not fun to use. I thought maybe it will take some time to get used to this new design on the keyboard ... after 2 months and using the keyboard for 7 - 9 hours a day... I am going for a better design one. This is the worst product I ever bought."
5,"Best Combo at this price range. Keyboard is quite smooth and mouse is also handy. Though mouse is little smaller, it is okay. Connectivity does not require anything you need to do on the system. Just plug-in the receiver on the PC/Laptop, turn on the Mouse, Boom!....they are connected immediately.Keyboard is very light weight and handy. You can go for it if you are looking for the budget wireless keyboard and mouse."
1,"mentioning 'chocolate keys' is not correct, built quality of keys is not at all up to the mark.. Keys get stuck while typing & layout of keyboard is also not standard. got rid within 1 day, not going to use it anymore"
2,The product is low priced.The mouse I got with  the keyboard is not working.I will be happy if they replace only the mouse and I wrote for a replacement and still It has not reached me.They told they will collect the defective when they bring the new one.hoping to hear from them I am waiting
3,In this product we didn't get the mouse.Please give the mouse
5,"Got the pack of three products today and happy with it , because as pricing point of view it's quite cheap to buy...in comparison of buying separately... quality is also fine in this range..."
2,"I bought this when the keyboard+mouse+hub combo was 399₹.  And I'll talk about it assuming it costs something similar where you are.I got this because I wanted something cheap and cheerful for setting up my Raspberry Pi Zero W. While I've seen USB Hubs go for 116₹ before, at the time of ordering they were all 200₹ or more and the cheapest keyboard was 350₹. So this made sense. I had spare mice already, so it was a bonus here.Now the build of the keyboard itself is utter rubbish. The keyboard bends and flexes like nothing else. The first one I got was broken. The second one seems fine but only as long as I baby it and never let it leave my table. This isn't meant to be tossed around.The mouse is even worse. It's a miniature sized mouse (even smaller than those Logitech wireless mice), and has a glaring red light coming out of it. While the movements and clicks are all fine, the scroll wheel is defective. This was true on both my initial order and the replacement. But I bought this for a Raspberry Pi that runs in console mode, so I don't really need to bother getting this addressed.The USB Hub is the only thing here that's built decently. Good to connect a keyboard and a mouse, and maybe a microcontroller or two. But I'm not sure this has enough data bandwidth for a pendrive. Haven't checked but not too concerned.BTW since I only need the keyboard on the Pi, I actually use the hub on my desktop now.Don't buy this if it's your only keyboard. As the saying goes, you buy nice or you buy twice."
5,"Used it for connecting to phone. Works well. For rs  399, it has good value."
1,Sir good morningmy first order of key board mouse scroll not working so i replace the order.But second time mouse good working but key board damaged or broken.Paking not good and transporter handled not satisfy.I SHAME to again return.Thanking you.
5,Mouse damaged.  Low quality
1,"I had order 3 combo, keyboard,mouse,usb4portconnector,But i received keyboard only. dont have mouse and usb 4port connector, please send it me ok."
2,I got damaged keyboard. The USB hub is also loosing connection after some time. I don't see this product is worth of money spent. Dissatisfied with overall product.
1,"Never buy this combo. When I received these products, the keyboard frame was already broken and tried using it. Later I found some of the keys were malfunctioning, automatically deleting without pressing any keys or adding letters.I applied for exchange the products, which I got it after 3 days and found the second keyboard was worst than the previous one. Got broken at the back of the keyboard. Now, the keys are not working, I don't want to change it as I am tired of these products."
3,"while typing it feels like keys are gonna come out of it. Otherwise it's ok ok, not too good quality though... but surely not very long lasting thing. it can be just for the time being."
3,"Because This Product gives you 3 Things A Keyboard , a Usb Port, A Mouse , You might say it's Value for money for 599/- But Don't Expect much in terms of Quality and Durability The so called Mouse is Not very sensitive and definitely Not for Long term use...I would say This As Not a Necessary Buy you can definitely Go for other Options it's just a Gimmick Stunt!!!!(3/5) i would say"
1,"Combo items looks value for money. But the quality doesn't worth it.Keyboard buttons were out of the board when I received it. I fixed it & it was working fine. Keyboard is very fragile.Mouse doesn't work well. Windows doesn't recognise it for most of the times. I tried it in multiple laptops (lenovo, HP).USB HUB: NO COMMENTS. Still working😕😕Review is after 20 days of use.... Nooo I can't return it. Don't waste your money... Go for better products."
3,I had read the reviews given below the product so I got confused so I give review that don't get confused this product is not upto the mark for keyboard only otherwise mouse n usb connector is good Overall the keyboard is in very bad quality only the main reason not to buy this product mouse is ok plusUsb connector is thin n light my main reason to return this product is only n only the keyboard
3,"I bought this as a replacement for my previous Artis keyboard. But even as a brand new keyboard, the sensitivity of the typing isn't that great. In fact, even as of writing this review it's still skipping letters and even spaces, because the typing doesn't register if I don't apply harder than average force. It can be fairly annoying.If you value typing, buy a better keyboard. For everything else, this is just fine.The mouse seems fine though. Nothing fancy. It just work."
4,The keyboard and mouse working fine. But the usb hub has stopped working since couple of days after 2 and half months. It was bundled and addon and hence complain much. For sure key board and mouse excellent.
5,"Overall, the product is very good both in terms of built quality and performance. I using this product from more than 3 years I also play games in free time and now after 3 years keyboard is not responding, and I bought now same combo pack.And I'm happy to say that ""this is the best quality product"".Thanks for reading..."
4,"Packaging must have been done badly, 1 corner edge of keybord was broken, otherwise everything working and good product"
3,The product is good but not that great but is definitely enough for the price you have to pay. The hub is really helpful. The keyboard and mouse are good but you may not get that feel as the keys r a little loose type of and the sensitivity of both mouse and keyboard is a little lagging sometimes. But overall a good product at the price.
5,The perfect combo for all external hub needs. The keys are bigger than most regular keyboards which minimises typos.  The mouse with red lighting is a tad small but can be ideal for adults with smaller palms. The USB hub with four slots works well and requires no installation.Overall the perfect combo!!
3,"It's a value for money product, Plastic quality is cheap however it's acceptable as per the cost.I didn't even get a chance to use it as the product was damaged during shipping and I have only return option.Amazon service is real good, I suggest you to go for it only if you have really low budget. Anyways Amazon is always with you guys."
2,"keeping same obstacle in view ,i had tried to talk and mail the matter to mfgr/vendor m/s quantum ,some mr PRAVIN called and very negatively communicated that nothing can b doneproduct is very poor and usb hub is useless with small wire,rendering entire item as uselessattitude of seller is not customer oriented"
5,I like this product verry much.I am very thankful to Amazon for this product.The keyboard is very smooth and soft.The USB hub and Mouse is alsovery good in quality.I have connected it with my mobile phone and it is on.I am really impressed.I will recommend it to buy this product in this very low price.The amazon delivery boy is also very good.Overall it is a wonderful experience.
1,"The scroll button of mouse broke just after 10 days of usage. They say the product has a warranty of 1 year but no information about how and where to claim it.There is no help provided from Amazon, as warranty is not covered by them but by Quantum Hi-Tech company. And you can keep searching the internet till eternity to find how to avail this warranty but it will be of no use."
3,"Gets the job done. Nothing more than that. The keys feel a bit hard. Received a keyboard with a corner chipped off, but due to covid times did not return it. Mouse works ok. The 4-in-1 unit has never worked for me. Thats just a wasted product."
1,"Cheap quality. Mouse stopped working within the first few days (luckily) and I could return. However, keyboard was OK. But there is no way to get replaced just mouse alone.Better to spend little more and go for better brands to avoid disappointments and returns, which is even more important during the lock down period."
5,"Value for money. Also received the mouse and multi usb port which is not included in the picture aa I have kept them aside since I don't require them now. The keyboard is a pertect one within this price range. About gaming, I'm not a gamer and I frankly don't know about it."
4,"Delivered the items as shown and promptly, The only issue with mouse, it stops working many times,you have to remove and connect again. Key board is very smooth and very good.Overall worth to buy at this price."
1,"Very worst product. could not last even 1 day, that too of very less usePlease do not buy this one.It is a learning for me not to purchase unbrand items like this. wastage of my hard earned money.Now i will have to buy a new one, since the replacement time has lapsed.In future if anyone buys an unbrand products please check as and when you receive, so that you could use the replacement windowFriends please avoid this keyboard"
1,DUE TO  CORONA  IMPACT  I  COULDNOT  RETURN  THE  PRODUCT.  THE MANUFACTURER  I  BELIEVE  MANUFACTURES  THE  PRODUCTS  FOR  KIDS  WITH  SHELF LIFE  OF ONLY  A WEEK.MY. SINCERE  REQUEST TO  AMAZON  TO BLACK LIST SUCH. SUPPLIERI.M  AMAZONS  DECADE OLD  BUYER
1,"I got opened box, and it doesn't have any packing like Amazon usually provide. So i disappointed by packaging. And when i opened the box i got broken mouse in the box.Well i have applied for replace hop it will be replaced soon."
4,Good Product but I receive my mouse break down...😊 But it is value for money Keyboard keys are too tight I use it for about 2 weeks but still it tight enough I hope it will be smoot.....the next all are good
5,"The keyboard, mouse and USB Extension work flawlessly. Absolute value for money.I am not posting pictures, as the products are as shown by the Seller."
1,Sadly the keyboard stopped working only after a day. However the USB port is still working.Don't fall for the combo offer.
1,Low quality and not compatible and some keys not working totally waste of money
1,Bought this product and mouse stopped working within a month. After 3 months keyboard also started creating problem. Go for some branded keyboard and mouse.
1,"if you purchase  this  product  you will waste your money.  after 15 days  when i  was using the keyboard it automatically  increase volume decrease  volume , if i pressed  a only once it shows  multiple a on screen. so this is my request to all  do not purchase this product if you want to save money"
5,"This is an awesome deal, you won't get much better than this at this price. In this price you are getting a good keyboard, a mouse and USB hub with 4 ports. All the products are of good quality. Don't think much more just go ahead and buy this product. You won't get much better than this."
4,"The key board is a full keyboard, and it works well. The mouse is a bit small. More suitable for children or portable use with laptops."
4,"While receiving itself the key board is broken but still i feel the keyboard quality is bit low, even though the price is low i strongly suggest to get some good keyboard which will be of good quality. Other than keyboard mouse and USB Port are working good ."
1,I have ordered this product three times. Every time I got a defective product. Amazon should delivered their product with more care.
5,Go for it if you want your keyboard to be protected from water spills and dust with a perfect fit and a seamless typing experience without any typing noiseHas a good positioned hole for the caps lock light all the printed text and numbers are very good and bright
5,This is extremely beautiful since one will even can't notice if it is there or not unless you say it is there. It sticks to the keypad perfectly. Only thing is it is just over priced. Around 300 to 320 rupees would be correct. I am using it for my dell 5510.
1,"it is not that premium that the seller is charging and this feels like and very cheap plastic cover not giving that good typing experience , it is not worth to go with this rups400"
4,The finger print reader on the Inspiron 16 Plus will not work through the cover. Fits perfectly on the keyboard.
5,I needed the extra protection. I wish the cover was more transparent but no biggie. It has the perfect thickness. I did have to get used to typing with it since its not as smooth.
5,Fit perfectly on my laptop.
5,"Ultimate cover, fitting and quality is perfect👍 Go for it for inspiron 15 5510"
5,Very Good Product and Quality
1,You can see well. How's the product.
1,After using ....keys are so hard while typing....every key is so strucking ....completely disappointed....have to buy another one ...Please don't sell these type of products in Amazon....Better don't sell cheap items....The brand I ball also got bad impress ion ....I lost hope on I ball...
3,Just okay. The keys are soft but the ENTER on the numpad doesn't always work properly. Works as a temporary replacement only.I will switch back to my TVS GOLD once it's repaired.
1,"I know seller rating is awsome but first time i was bad experienced from seller and this is waste products do not buy I ball keyboard I had bought in 26 December but i received in 2 january and the dot key is not working then According to seller rating I guess it mistake from seller but I think next time, it will deliver good product so, I decided to return this product on 2 january and it reached my place on 7 january and then main part the (A) alphabet is entered inside and doesn't work then so i decided to refund my money overall experience is bad for I ball keyboard. I had attached images and video and I don't recommend to buy this keyboard online and specially from seller Appario Retail Private Ltd."
1,"Poor quality. Press one number, double numbers are typed. Defective keys"
1,This product is virtually unusable.  Several keys type double and one has to make endless corrections. The lettering on the keys is poor and hardly visible except in very very bright light. Go for another model.
1,"I have used Keyboards right from Logitech, Microsoft, TVS, Dell, Quantum, Terrabytes and few unknown brand keyboards so far. Except one brand which had hard keys, all other were soft for typing.Coming to this iBall Keyboard...its peculiar as given below.1. Key ""M"" is very hard2. Key ""I"" is already well downside and not pushing up much.3. Keys ""O"", ""P"" and ""Backspace"" are slightly downside and not pushing up much.4. Some keys are slightly hard or slightly soft type5. Some keys (Function keys) are soft.I am not sure how anyone can type with this kind of keyboard. So, dont buy seeing the offer price and 3 years warranty provided."
1,"Pressing 'l' key does not register randomly, causing lots of distraction and subconscious fatigue.iBall's support is so pathetic. Just throw out the keyboard when you run into an issue."
5,"I have always been a fan of iBall keyboard. Unfortunately, 2 years ago my keyboard died and I had to buy a new one. At the time I bought an HP 160 combo. Something didn't feel right but had no choice so kept using it. Now I needed another keyboard and thought of the old love. By this time I had forgotten the iBall experience. The keyboard seemed smaller than the HP 160. But the keys are bigger. So started typing and by the time I completed a line, I realized why I was craving for the iball experience. This keyboard is butter smooth. I can feel the smoothness in every word I type. Won't ever buy any other brand's peripherals again. iBall for life!"
1,"- Pros1. Look is above average, if not the best.2. Very Lightweight3. Numeric keypad section.4. One step adjustable stand.- Cons1. Keys are not consistent, some of the keys are responding very well but others are either too loose (so types more than once if you aren't sure how much pressure to apply) or too hard (so types nothing if you apply normal pressure on those keys) than normal. This leads to MORE TYPING ERRORS than comfort.2. They promise 3year warranty.. wait.. 3 years? Trust me it's not gonna work more than 6-8 months on normal usage.3. Build quality is very bad, very very bad. Feels like it's not from iBall but from iKall (LOL),4. USB is loose and disconnects if the wire is stretched/moved/adjusted.5. Some of the keys are situated at lower height than normal, feels like already pressed.Such keys are F2,F3,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,F10,F11,F12, PrintScreen, ScrollLock, 0 (Zero, from second row of keys), Backspace, \ key, Left Shift Key, x key, Comma key, dot key (i.e. > key), / key.6. Numeric pad's key 5 is hardest among all. Need to press too hard to get it work.7. ScrollLock LED is not working.8. Spacebar is so sensitive that it actually makes 2 spaces in one pressed event.9. DEFINITELY NOT FOR PROGRAMMERS/BLOGGERS/TYPISTS.10. The Rating of this product (3.9 stars) is over-amplified by the Amazon Logic (to verify this, you can read actual reviews).11. Return/refund is not allowed for such a waste product, only replacement is possible. So in that case, you are going to get A BRAND NEW ""SIMILAR SHIT"" IN THE NEW PACK.12. The warranty does not cover the physical damage, that means only membrane failure will be considered. Believe me, even if the membrane survives 3 years, the keyboard body & keys won't. So the warranty here is also not useful.I would suggest try even cheaper products like Zebronics etc, at least you could save some money for almost same quality. Or go for bit higher price range like HP, Logitech, etc for much much better quality product.I've ordered the replacement. I'll update the review based on the replacement."
1,Earlier I don't know why I gave review as good product. but I think that's my early reaction. In last 20 years I used so many keyboards. I never thought I'll be writing complaint about any keyboard. Because it's rare thing to be stopped working. I'll never recommend this brands keyboard. First of all there is big issue with Control button and I think it's common because same issue my friend is also facing and now button Z is not working.  ☹️
1,The keyboard they supplied first was defective the [ was pressed down . I asked for a replacement and even that key board is defective. The 0 key is pressed down.not aligned properly. Not sure how many times I will have to ask for repolacement foir this Rs 349 keyboard. Killing my parience. For the first time I have received such a bad product from amazon.  once i request for a rupee keyboard it asks us the purchase RAR extractar file for Rs 349/- The free smart keys multilingual from akrutisoftware is not to be seen anywhere in the website.
1,"The iball keyboards are used to be great, but not as expected now. This review I'm writing just after 5 minutes of use. Keys are soft but had lot of friction while typing. Give away lot of buzzing noise that irritates hell lot. Now stuck with it as there is only replacement and not returning. I have to throw it away (will send it to some school) and already purchased another one"
4,Been using for the last 2 months.  Very good product.
2,"Received the keyboard during corona. Didn't use it for some days. After the replacement period of 7 days, realized that some keys don't work. The period and the z key for example have to be pressed a few times before they actually work. Otherwise it looks to be a good product Regular size, light weight."
3,After using for 4 months i am writing this review.  Initially it was good but after 4 months back space not working.Planning to buy Logitech this time.
1,This is the very worst products please don't buy it . Keywords is not working correctly all key is very hard .we can't type easily one key we need to be press twice time. Some key are not working it's not easy to type . I totally loss my money please don't buy it.. Amazon don't fool to the people selling like this kachra product. I have used only 15 days for this keyboard few keys are not working . I have call to the customer support but no used. This is copy of iBall putting label brand name and selling 3rd class product. I have loss my money .  I am looking for replacement but not getting any response. I have lost my trust in Amazon. Please please don't buy it...
4,"I have been working from home since the past one year and thought of buying a cheap and durable keyboard. iBall was a no brainer since it is a known brand, I got this keyboard for Rs. 359 and have been using it for more than 6 months now. The numeric keypad is great for quick input of numbers and the keyboard is great to use. Just go for it if you are looking for a keyboard for general work and your budget is less than Rs. 500.The only flaw I found was that the number 6 key in the numeric keypad would come twice on the screen if I pressed it once - this was fixed by removing the key and placing the rubber under it correctly."
2,"The keyboard switches and panel are quite good. But the connecting wire curls up and ""memorizes"" it so that it automatically curls every time. You have to keep on uncurling it.If they change the wire/cord, its a great keyboard. But until then, I am afraid its useless. Sorry."
3,"Shift key is very hard to press so the #,%,^,&,$,@ symbols don't type in the first go, needs to press hardly, also the minus key remains pressed and is not coming up as shown in the attached picture so can't even type that. Otherwise overall it was full size, stand had very less inclination, the typing experience was good and the keys aren't that silent, they do make some sound even with less force while typing. Returning or replacing this one and hence 3 stars."
1,The Keyboard was defective within 20 working days. Had to run around to give the defective product at iBall service centre. Today we are almost 2 months in waiting but no response from the service centre or any final settlement of the defective product. Most pathetic service - iBall Should CLOSE its business rather than creating FRAUD.
3,"Really wonder why the Home/End, Page up/Page down, and Insert/Delete keys are interchanged from the usual place where they must have been....This led to a lot of typo for me.  Threw it out after just a week use, as the P and O keys lost their normal function; either I have to punch them hard or for a single press 2 or 3 P and O gets typed...."
3,"everything is perfect and all is very good ,but the no 1,2,3 keys have some issues  . they automatically pressed multiple times when u press only once , this is really very irritating ."
5,The first keyboard I got from the seller had got a defect. It's num-lock key was pressed. So asked for replacement and got a new one. This time the keyboard was good. And rating it after around a month of use.  Did not try it for gaming though.  But for day to day use it's good.
5,A very Good keyboard of nice size and good functionality. Best suited for desktops and other regular use with tabs and laptops. Built material satisfactory. Performance is very good
2,"This is not the keyboard for fast typers. The space is not working. One should press in the middle of the space bar in order to space. If you keep pressing corner side, it won't work. I don't like it."
4,Good design user friendly the keys are soft and yet firm special thing it is water reistant and works flawless
5,This is my second partnership with this laptop the earlier one is used for 5 years and bought one more last year.No complaints. You can rage on this laptop no matter how hard you use it none of the buttons get damaged.
5,"Bought this to maintain some distance from laptop as WFH is becoming new normal and had to maintain a proper posture. Overall, it's good quality and worthy!"
1,Please do not buy this. The key board stopped working in 15 days.... My return window also got closed. I won't recommended this product to anyone.
1,Worst performance after one week keys are operated automatically please dont buy this first operate correctly after don't compability with any os alla are same operated automatically
4,"The keyboard works fine. The paint used for marking the alphabets and numbers apparently has a ""glitter"" element. This makes it difficult to read the keyboard under artificial light."
2,The number keys on the right side are not working. And it is just two months back that I bought the keyboard. Real bad experience.
1,"Some of keys are not getting up like in image see key number 6, which stucked down.I ordered two times but both the time different keys are defective.It seems that this seller is only selling defective product at discount price."
5,giid
4,"First seller delivered a defective product, I opted for replacement. It was immediately accepted and replaced, thanks. The keyboard is ofcourse value for money, the keys are soft. Go for it."
3,"This item not for gaming, good product but expensive. If the price between rs250 to rs300, then it's a value for money product"
1,"Plastic quality is too bad, Very less weight. looks like the Alphabet print may fade after some time."
1,"Not a good product, stopped working after a month and there is no help from iball service center regarding warranty"
2,The keys are getting stuck while typing. Avoid. Backspace key works only if pressed hard otherwise doesn't.

4,"this keyboard is very very cool and good for just 999/-it has various lighting modes and brightness levels.. it also comes with three different levels of speed.the multimedia keys are extremely handy and the keys are uplifted and gives you the ultimate pleasure of typing.the keys are removable and the keyboard is easily cleanable. its a membrane keyboard but gives you a mechanical feel.the only downside of the keyboard is how it looks, it has a very weird design, it could've been plain and simple like a rectangular keyboard, then it would've been epic, but other than this flaw of its weird design, the keyboard is flawless.typing the review with this keyboard. hope this helps.. :)"
2,THE BRIGHTNESS ONTHE FUNCTION KEYS AND NUMBER KEYS IS VERY LOW. TYPING EXPERIENCE IS NOT GOOD.THIS PRODUCT HAS NO RETURN POLICY.
4,"PROS : Affordable, decent material, mechanical feel, can choose among 7 different colours and modes, shortcut media buttons are very useful, wire is high quality, overall great budget keyboard..!!CONS : Not for professional gaming as responsiveness is not that great for fast tapping, it is a actually a membrane keyboard, RGB control is limited by keyboard only.. no ARGB support and software..."
4,"Loved it. Customization is decent, can't expect more at the price, and wouldn't know honestly what to do with more. Macro keys would've been nice - the given keys at the top right are somewhat useful, the left side is uselessResponse is nice, sometimes not enough though - of course this is not a replacement for a mechanical keyboard.Wire is decent, has gone through a few strong pulls and is working"

1,"I won't recommend this keyboard.I had ordered this keyboard,nice that i got early delievery.But the product was damaged internally.I got the ctrl key detached from the keyboard and lying in the box, it really disappointed me as i ordered a new keyboard so it was not expected.When i plugged it in into my pc,From the very beginning onlyIt was automatically disconnecting and reconnceting again and again.It created lot of problems for me,hopefully on the last day of 10 days replacement time,I asked for a replacement,Got it within a week, and i was shocked ,the replacement keyboard ,after 2 days,It also started creating the same problem.I have returned this product, and i won't recommend this keyboard to anyone.Don't get fascinated with the price.Its cheaper coz of the quality as well.Not a very gud quality of keys as well.Buying This keyboard was an awful experience for me."

3,"A decent keyboard in its price range, but I would not recommend this for gaming.1. Membrane keyboard, so its pretty soft if you are only going to type with it or are going to very casually game.2. No anti-ghosting, not even for WASD + Shift.3. Lights are pretty dim compared how it is advertised here, it screams that it is a cheap keyboard but in reality it really is cheap so what are we complaining about?4. Wrist Rest is decent enough for small to medium hands. For large hands it pointless, I'd advice picking up a separate memory foam wrist rest to slide next to it.5. Body is plastic and not really the strongest kind of plastic I've seen. But again, this is a cheap keyboard so we really shouldn't be expecting a titanium body."
1,"It is sturdy otherwise.comes with laser itched keys, that means you can barely see the letters on the keys even in daytime, unless lights are turned on. Key caps are narrow and scaled down from top, too much chamfered/fillet on top, reducing surface area while making keystrokes, resulting in too many typing errors,for if your finger lands on the side of the key, there is a great probability of hitting the adjoining keys. backlight is poor as with all other rgb keyboard's, considering the fact, what max you can achieve over just 0.5v usb, and wasting all the wattage on fancy disco lights in back rather than using that power for only backlit keys, for letters/alphabets to glow brighter.***this review in general applies to all rgb kb's, where manufacturers focus only on showoff and fancy details with no eye to cater to professional users who demand productivity.also mostly rgb kb's have narrow key caps(not just with this one), so that more light can bleed out of membrane, making it look more flashy and alluring to the major segment of nube buyers.**got it for Rs 999 without any sale or offer."
5,"When I heard name chiptroniks I was a little hesitant but all the features is keyboard has really helped, its been 5 months and im using it to play all the multiplier and our story games and the the RGB man... it works like a charm and adds a cooler look to ur setup, the keys are responsive and almost inaudible even after rough usage, I recommend this keyboard for coders as well, because it makes typing easier and u will feel less tired XD."
4,"Brightness is not much. Average that you can work in dark place without eye irritation.Sturdiness is fine for the price.IRRITATING PROBLEM IS BELOW :Only problem is with the ""ENTER"" key placement. Usually the enter key will be in ASD row in most usb keyboards, but in this  the ENTER key is in vertical combined both ASD and QWE rows. \| this key should've been in QWE row.Because of this whenever you are speed typing you will type ""\"" instead of ENTER..takes time to adapt...."

1,"Guys, never ever dare to purchase this product. I am writing this review after a year of using this Chiptronex Kranos keyboard. The keyboard shows its real behaviour. 3 keys, namely the start/windows key, spacebar and backslash keys stopped working gradually. Contacted the customer care from the email IDs in their website, but got no response and one email ID was invalid though. Contacted Amazon and they told that they couldn't help. It costed me Rs 999 when I bought this in June 2020 and all this vanished into thin air. The brand only have an address,but no contact number either. They are still selling this product. Again I'm saying, please don't waste your money on this like I did."
5,"I am so satisfied with this keyboard being at this price point it is just the best keyboard to buy also you can control the rgb of it to single color, it has 3 presets and you can customize the colour of the presets also and you will have 7 colour options like red green yellow.Go for it. :)Only one thing which can be a pro as well as a con.It is that this keyboard has transparent switches which means that you can see the switches when you have turned the rgb of the keyboard on and your room lights off. But you can never see it properly when your rgb of the keyboard is turned off so do not turn it off."
1,So first i buy it on 2021 starting.And it work great and nice.But after 6 months 2 keys dont work properly.When i plug out then plug in the keyboard the key work some time and some time not.Then after one week it stopped working.Then i contact with chiptronex service. They dont receive my call from one week and i do mail to but they don't respond.Then i contact amazon service. They tell me to mail chiptronex and tell me to wait for 3 day. Then in 2day i dont get any response of mail. Then i try to re contact from call. I call them for 20 time. then after  20 call they pickup my call. And then i tell them about the key not working they said that i want to send them the keyboard to Chennai with my oven money. They don't have pickup service. And they tell that you ship it to Chennai then they send it to Hong Kong and it repair in Hong Kong and then they send me in 10 to 7 working days.But i dont believe them because if they pickup my call after one week they how can they send me the keyboard after 10 to 7 days.So guys who want to buy this first check the service center of the company.Because we don't get money from the tree.So be careful

4,"The only reason I bought this keyboard is because it has dedicated multimedia keys! There wasn't a single keyboard in this price range with a dedicated multimedia keys!Brightness of the keyboard is lower than expected but works good. Don't like the new 'Enter' key button, they have changed the layout/ added a different button next to it! Overall it works good, the size of the buttons is decent but could have had a larger surface area."
5,"awesome keyboard.big key size, I require that.Satisfying click sounds.The touch feel is great. Way sturdier than my previous keyboards.the lights are bright enough to be seen in daylight.Pretty heavy"

4,"For the price , it is really good but the problem is that it sometimes disconnects even if the cable moves a little bit which is a bit annoying when it happens in the middle of a game and the spacebar key , takes some time to get used to as it is very different sounding and feeling from the other keys. Overall it is ok if u are just getting into gaming but if u want to have a very high end one don't go for this and isntead buy some better mechanical keyboards . I have been using it for 4 months now and still sometimes it feels weird when pressing space for jump when i am bhopping in game."
5,"The background light can be switched off if not required, changing to the required color is swift. the keyboard feels like a mechanical keyboard. Overall a good choice, i am satisfied after 3 months usage. No issues. buy it confidently. i am sure the user will be happy about the choice and its price."

5,best looking keyboard  beautifull every thing working perfect thanx amazon  i use many expensive  keyboards but this one is the best lokking and eassy to function keyboard.amaozn delvery very good good packging.101% saisfied for its looks perfomance and gaming and lights i give 10/10 for they beautifull keyboards specially  for gamers
4,"Pros:-1) Working very well and led lights are best,2) Very happy to use them at night without needing room light to type.3) Also it has more function keys to run the pc.Scope of improvement -1) Need function keys for changing brightness, sleep.2) My CSE student brother says that this keyboard needs more mechanical typing feeling.3) This particular feedback is for the amazon courier service that it really needs to make sure that the product be delivered in good packaging condition. When my mother received it, the outer cover was not sealed but fully opened, but when I checked the product, it's working & physical condition, I then decided not to return and I am happy that this product is good enough for keeping as I urgently needed the keyboard to use the laptop after my laptop lost it's in-built keyboard due to water vapor and that short circuited the laptop's motherboard chip and therefore had to shell out Rs.3,200/- for repairing it and could have to shell out Rs.1,800/- more if replacement of in built keyboard was done and still there is a chance to get issues in future especially in rainy season or weather.. Still the product could have been changed by the delivery person as Mom said that he was looking clearly in rush mood. Then I realized the reason but was wondering why did he do it when he didn't change the keyboard-_- So one star less for this bad experience by delivery person.I got it @ Rs.949/- which is reasonable for this keyboard. So, Value for money! Would surely recommend to buy this one! Thank you!"
3,"Great quality for the price. Cable was long enough for PC setup. I never use RGB light, but this one came with so many options I am now a fan of RGB lighting.Cons:Only issue I faced was the Multimedia keys like Mute, Volume up and Down are not very responsive. At one point the volume just wouldn't unmute after using the Keyboard Mute key."
5,"I bought it for my Samsung Smart TV TU8000 UHD and it works amazing.....Instead of typing it with remote which is boring and time taking process, with this multilight keyboard ( lights can be customised as per your wish) things get pretty smooth."
5,"I thought i will never get this product as the tracking section says it was lost in transit. But i wanted it badly so i waited patiently 'cause it was already out of stock. Ordered this product in August and got it in the last week of September. When i finally got it, the packing was not good (you can see in the pictures). Nevertheless, the keyboard is a good one. Very reasonable price for soft keys while typing or gaming. RGB lights are great and everything is nice."
5,"Hi ,I had a gaming keyboard earlier i.e asus cetrbus and it cost me around 2.8k. idk what happened but 2-3 keys stopped working soni had to buy a new one and trust me i had spent around fee hours looking reviews on YouTube and this keyboard is more then i expected .For approx 1k i got this keyboard and its superb amazing and therr is a gold plate usb whicj gives you 2 ms response .The keys are softer and smooth.The downside i felt this keyboard should have a bit more brightness and a little big enter key thats it .Apart from that i m very very happy to have this keyboard"
5,Loved the keyboard. The keys are really well balanced and love the feel and the clicks. The colors and the keys to change the options are easy enough to remem. The only gripe I have is that the marks on the individual keys are sometimes not visible. And they look unfinished. Maybe it's just mine. But over all a good keyboard.
5,"Pros: Smooth keys, Great looks, Good Quality usb cable, Many RGB control options, Turn off lights option available, Dedicated as well as combo multimedia and function keys, Enough hand rest space, Good for gaming.Cons: Nothing as such.Note: As this is a gaming product, Dimensions (LxWxH) of keyboard may not comfortably fit into standard computer table furniture.Overall great product."
5,"This is the best Keyboard I have used till now (not including mechanical). It has got 7 different colours which obviously you can set as oer your preference !! The Breathing Light Feature is just amazing, You can Change the brightness of the lights and the even Speed of changing colours !! The Key Travel Distance is Nice !! I use it very Roughly it has got a Really Nice Build Quality !! It also has Multimedia Keys On the Top !! Surely If You Want a Keyboard in around 1000 to 1200 rs this is a really nice choice !!"
4,"Average keyboard. You get what you pay for. You can switch to multiple light. Solid or multi. It has Red, Pink/purple, blue, light blue, Green, yellow, white and rainbow. It also has some different light mode like waving. Overall not something that will make you a better gamer but it simply is good."
4,"I bought this keyboard which was on sale for Rs 999/. The space bar was found seperately in the box and that's where the cons end. After 10 days of usage, I find this keyboard really comfortable to type with and the gaming experience was good as well. No other cons found in this product. It's the best you can find under 1000/-. Go for it ✌️"
4,the build quality of the product is ok also the amount of colour combinations is also really good and it's something that you do not get at this price point. But since it costs only thousand rupees hence cost cutting had to be done in some places. The quality of the keycaps is little below average also in an effort tu to include all the keys inside the standard size of the keyboard I have to say that the size of the keys is little bit small and if you like me who is accustomed to typing on a laptop then you will face a little problem initially but this is not a deal breaker because it can be e adjusted to in about a week or so. Also the force required to press the key is really less so since the keycaps are small sometimes I accidentally press 2 3 keys at the same time but that again can be adjusted to in sometime. in conclusion if you want an average quality keyboard with lots of beautiful colour combinations then you can definitely go for it.
5,"Just installed the keyboard to my computer and it looks swell....all the features that were mentioned on Amazon was there on the keyboard and the touch too is really soft and the keyboard is really sturdy. Worth for the money. Hope IT STAYS THE SAME WAY, atleast for a YEAR OR TWO !!"

4,"1. About CaseThe quality of the case is too good and it is perfectly edged for the headphone jack. Also, in the starting for tablet A7 there are not many option for the case but it fit properly with the tablet.2. About KeyboardThis keyboard functioning is as same as normal wireles keyboard. Only difference from other wireless keyboard is; it is too lightweight and thin. The battery backup can hold for 3 weeks and yes it depends on your work too. But in my keyboard there are no carryover buttons for brightness because earlier in Tab S6 mini cover the keyboard comes with this functionality.To be very honest if you haven't buy any case for your tablet you can go with it but if you only want keyboard, you can go for seperate keyboard of About The Fit in which you can have trackpad too."

3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
1,"Not as per image, waste of money I choose this because of its hand resting area but it’s not as per image"
1,"Not as per image, waste of money I choose this because of its hand resting area but it’s not as per image"
5,"The keyboard and  mouse are fabulous in this time of work from home this things are must and they are a good buy at this price, keyboard is a full length keypad with dual numeric keys and have a good range of handfree. the mouse is very sleek and stylis and can work on any surface the adapter is also good overall its a very nice buy and design are top notch i would recommend to try this."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
5,keyword & mouse combo is really nice quality & works so good i like it personally & recommend highly use it once try  & best quality product
1,"Don't buy this product.. Had very bad experience ever.. This keyboard requires 1 mini cell per day... If you use Duracell power it's work 2 days only.. Trying to return this product, return process re-scheduled 3 times.. Amzon need to focus in this."
5,"I am working from home and looking for a good wireless keyboard and Mouse and found this. It's a very good combo, and the best thing about this is you have a unique Nano receiver so you don't require a separate receiver for Keyboard and Mouse.The keyboard keys are very good. And it works in my entire room from where ever I have operated it. It's a good solution at an affordable price with a 1+-year warranty."
2,"Post seeing the positive review bought the keyword not sure if  i got the defect product, need to hard press  space bar to ensure the space is added . See below how it types without hard press on few keyboard.hellothisis the sample textfrom the newkeyboardSee how it words above.. LOL not sure  if other also have same issue-------Update 2-------------I replaced the product with  another one, other product also have the same issue, kindly don't by this product"
4,"Keyboard is okish, Mouse is very comfortable as said but 1000dpi only. Worth the price."
5,"Well best in the segment, like it's very hard to get a combo of both mouse and keyboard at such a nominal price. Connection are spontaneous and effective. Overall it a good deal. Thanks flix and Amazon."
3,Keyboard is nice in this price rangeBus mouse battery fully drained in 2 day
5,The response time is perfect no lag or throttling and it has great 10m connectivity range. The keyboard is full length keyboard with separate numeric keys as well. The quality of keys is awesome and no noise while typing. The mouse is perfect to hold and scroll also working perfectly. In all great wireless keyboard in this section!!!
5,I buy product and happy to using it it's very good product nice finishing and easy to use range is also good and good for laptop and pc I also tryed in mob it's working 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍nice product every one who have need must to purchase it 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼Change wired to wireless😅😅😅😅
4,The key letters seem to be stickers affixed on the keys rather than laser printing/engraving. Not sure how long will it go.
1,I had to change the duracell battery  of both mouse and keyboard on the 3rd day. if you go with this mouse be ready to change your battery every 3rd/4th day.
5,Keyboard is so Good quality mouse is also Good and connectivity to pc is strong and quick response to action is Quick
5,It makes you feel quite comfortable while using it and ergonomics make you feel much betterMouse is quite good in performance meanwhile in battery even mouse gives a much better performance and keyboard is quite responsive
5,Great wireless keyboard+ mouse comboAbsolutely loving this product.very comfy and easy to put in my backpack. so soft keystrokes . In this price rage still worth it. This device deserve 5 star rating.
5,Amazing keyboard and mouse. I have working on many keyboard but this wireless keyboard and mouse give me perfect comfort during my worl. Full value for money. Also perfect keyboard for gaming🎮. Extremely recommended for buy

1,Video Player is loading.
1,Keyboard stopped working on second day
1,it consumes a lot of batteries (One battery gives 3 hours only) so very very bad product and don't buy this.
1,"My keyboard stopped working shortly after using it, mouse works fine."

5,Very good product
5,"Really liked both the keyboard and mouse. Keyboard is very smooth and without any noise. Mouse also functions in a very smooth way. Keyboard is  of full size. As  both of them are wireless, so  my workspace has become very tidy now. Overall, a wonderful value for money combo."
5,The keyboard and mouse are of good quality and the size of the mouse is also standard size and the grip is also good .the body is good not like light plastic body.and is durable Best price for wireless combo of keyboard and mouse
5,"Vary nice build quality , n light weight ....with this price range it's a best product.."
1,Keyboard and mouse quality is not good. i m not satisfied. Not easy to operate and handling.
5,this flix wireless keyboard working perfectly without any lack or problemaccuracy and speed of mouse and keyboard is wonderful.product quality is very good and strong.it is value for money.
5,Excellent in all departments. Exceeded expectations. Matches aesthetically with silver iMac
5,good quality and a soft keys
5,"This is the hands down best Bluetooth keyboard, compared to those in the market. Things to consider, if you have ipad,mac, this is really helpful.It can also connect with other usb c devices using the cable provided, the phone was typing based on the inputs from the keyboard. It was cool, cannot be used like 28000 Rs  magic keyboard for ipad, but then it does its work."
5,It has been only 3 days since I got the Apple keyboard. I tried 3 keyboards in the last 1 year of different brands and none of them were satisfactory. Finally bought this one which was launched by apple last month. Perfect to use with my mac that is connected to external monitor.
5,"The product is unbeatable, if you are willing to pay extra bucks then you do get the top notch quality. I am absolutely amazed with performance."
5,Very comfortable to use and ergonomically perfect. Lightweight and easy to carry.
5,"I am so excited using this new apple keyboard, I loved it."
4,"I'm not going to review the mouse - I'm only using the keyboard with a G304.This was used to upgrade a MK345, which had earlier replaced a MK235. The 345 was a better keyboard but the unbroken F key line and exclusion of dedicated media controls was a real issue.I use these keyboards on the bed, in the lap and they're way below eye level, so looking at the keyboard isn't always possible. Also, requiring to press two keys simultaneously to control volume is very cumbersome.The 540 is a pretty heavy and large keyboard. The 345, while larger and heavier than the 235, was easier to use because it wouldn't tip over easily. The 540 feels twice as heavy, but surprisingly, much more comfortable.The large palmrest keeps the wrist at a good angle to the keys, and is not contoured. This means I get good palm action across all the keys. The keys themselves are quite soft and also have a fairly tactile feel. Because the keyboard is so heavy, pressing keys at one end doesn't tip it over. At the same time, it's not so heavy as to cause leg ache. Maybe if used for a few hours, but for casual use it's great.Though I haven't used the mouse, like all wireless Logis it will exhibit middle button failure after a month or two. It looks pretty slick with the retro two-tone colour scheme, but there's no additional buttons to make it any more interesting to use than other mice on the family.Range is decent (I use an extension cable to avoid any issues), but there is some crosstalk with the G series receiver. The MK345 was immune to this, so I could use that keyboard with the G304 mouse.If you are able to secure a new unit (my first one was unsealed, probably a returned unit, with the receiver missing - the replacement was fine), this is a pretty decent buy."
5,"Best comfort, Its very soft and mechanical keyboard.  There is a capslock light on the button, you can turn off/on, there are multimedia keys, You can turn on/off numslock but no indicator. There is a indicator to show your keyboard is on and it turns on only when required.The keys are so soft and ergonomically placed. The handrest is also soft and good. The rubber coated mouse is so good to hold. The reviews on small mouse I don't agree. Its the best combo I ever had. Please go for it. If you need comfort and quality.Also it has 4"" and 8"" to comfort your wrist.After a long usage for 12 hours a day,  I feel it's the best product you can look for"
3,"Bought this after reading good reviews and complaint that tge mouse is big. I wanted a bug mouse.The keyboard and mouse were recognized instantly on Windows, and working as expected.Problem: Keyboard keys are too soft. There is no feedback. So typing isn't satisfying. Even my laptop keys feel better.Mouse is long, but narrow. Don't know how people are complaining about size. I wanted a wider one.Sadly, the item is not returnable."
1,"After using for 6 months, feeling this to be worst product from Logitech and very disappointing. Cheaper wireless k/b and mouse combo from Logitech used before is far better than this product. Very expensive and not a good product. Key press are very slow and sometimes wrong key press happens due to the slow rate. Not worth for the money paid."
5,"Bought the keyboard mouse combo. Keyboard is broad and full. It is a membrane keyboard but still does offer some form of noise when typing. Some of the keys can be reprogrammed with the software downloadable on Logitech's website. Talking about the mouse, it took a few days to get used to it as I was coming from a HP dual mode mouse with side buttons. Mouse is a bit on the heavy side. The grips have a rubberised feel to them and I like it. The sensitivity cannot be adjusted which is a bummer. Only downside is that only a single receiver is given (attached on the inner flap of the box). Feel free to ask me any questions you have."
5,"This is a very comfortable to use keyboard, keys are very smooth, and has right balance of travel distance on press and yet silent. The undulating curve on each very is also good design. The prints are clear and hope it will long. The short cut keys are very useful. The keyboard and mouse are very easy to set up and just works seamlessly once the dongle is plugged to the usb port of laptop. Includes battery from Duracell is very  customer friendly gesture and eases the setup right out of the box.If I have to be picky about two drawbacks1. The palmrest could be little bigger and soft fabric for better feel2. Mouse could have some side buttonsThe same keyboard is sold in Amazon US at similar price point with the above two features included."
5,"Keys are really smooth and comfortable. Very less noise from keys but still gives a good typing feel. Bought logitec cheaper version before which was also good but makes noise while typing. So, gave it to my kid and took this one. This is cool.Mouse is full size. Fits hand properly. If you are a fan of smaller models, you may not like it."
1,"Think, have received an used product. Even Bluetooth connector is not in dedicated slot. It’s just kept in the packing cover"
2,"The keys awfully closer than you might like which slows you down considerably. The mouse does not have a DPI setting and is painful to use. Even for normal office work, it is not a suitable mouse and the comfort is missing. The mouse pointer is slow and even changing the pointer setting in Windows did not render the speed as desired. The Logitech support software too does a poor job in changing the mouse's pointer speed. There are a variety of useless customization settings available on the Logitech software whereas the necessary DPI setting is missing. One of the positives from the keyboard is that it is completely a silent keyboard. The hand rest feature is very good. The multimedia button for play/pause does not work with YouTube on Google Chrome. There is a button to verify whether the battery is empty or not which is again useless for two reasons. First, when you press any key when the system is off or after a long time, the led battery indicator blinks. Second, when the system is on and you are working on it, do you really need a battery indicator to see if your battery is empty or would you press a key and find out? The keyboard + mouse duo is completely unsuitable for gaming purpose. The keyboard looks highly durable and there is no issue with any of the keys on it, except the play/pause multimedia key as mentioned above. The dual tilt is good and the keyboard has an ergonomic design.Pros:1. Ergonomic Design2. Dual Tilt Keyboard3. Silent Keyboard4. Good Hand Rest Feature5. Multimedia Keys6. Appears to be Highly Durable and Long LastingCons1. Poor Mouse Design2. Poor Mouse Settings3. Poor Mouse Size4. Useless Settings on Logitech Software, Important Ones Missing5. Play/Pause Key not working with YouTube on Chrome6. Useless Battery Indicator Button7. No Option to Change Mouse's DPI Setting8. Not Suitable for Gaming9. Slows Down Typing"
4,"The product is satisfactory. Good soft keys unlike previous generation keyboards with knocking sound. Though soft keys lack sharp feedback, we have all been accustomed to typing without feedback since the advent of laptop keys and touchscreen keyboard. So that is an acceptable con, and in fact a boon if you want to type something silently say in a room where is child is sleeping. Regarding the mouse, it is big enough, and specially long enough, but not wide enough. It fits in my 4 fingers very nicely, but leaves the little finger dangling on the side."
5,"Keys are soft touch and no click clack sound. Wake up from sleep on keystroke as keyboard goes into sleep auto. Palmrest is good enough and keys are raised island style, so you cannot miss a hit on any of the keys. The mouse is also responsive on both flat tabletop surface as well as tablecloth surface, again a wake up from sleep function. Overall a good purchase. Could have been better if Logitech manufactured in India. Why continue to source from China"
4,"It works well, the setup was a breeze because it linked immediately to my existing mouse's unifying dongle. It also types very well with minimal sound, and I think my typing speed has increased a bit too. My only negative about it is that whenever I'm in bed and wanna use it on my lap, it's very slippery. The finishing of the plastic body is very smooth back and front and so there's practically no grip. Considering I do this very often (i call it 'work from bed'), this is an annoyance. Other than that, highly recommended."
5,"Really luxurious look of mouse and keyboard. It shows it has something different from others.Keys are the soft and much better experience of silent writing.Even with Logitech software, we can adjust the number of functions such as mouse scroll speed, smooth scrolling of websites, change keyboard button custom function, etc. Battery notifications are shown on the laptop also.Mouse almost works on any surface."
2,"Was using dell wired keyboard earlier which I had bought for about 600/- INR. This logitech keyboard has a very bad design, very big and heavy compared to the dell keyboard. Keys are very soft compared to dell but gives very weird feel when typing.Had bought it because of the palm rest and  soft keys.. and not satisfied with both.. Dell keyboard without palm rest feels much better. I can't keep my hands on the desktop due to the palm rest. Palm rest only has space for the palm and no support for the arm, it doesn't even allow resting your arm in the desktop because if you do so you won't be able to type properly. Mouse is also big and doesn't fit properly in the hand which causes pain in the palm. Was using logitech mouse with similar design but smaller in size which felt better. I feel like throwing it in the dustbin. Just wasted my 3.5k. Can't type fast in this keyboard. This keyboard is exactly opposite of what I had expected after reading reviews. Typing feel is not good at all irrespective of having soft keys. Space bar is the worst, I hate it the most. I make typing mistakes whenever I touch the spacebar.Pros:- Soft KeysCons:- Big bulky design- Slow typing- Bad Spacebar feedbackWill I recommend it?If you have ""dhai kilo ka hath"" (big hand) then you might like it but still I will suggest to go for a slim keyboard with scissor keys.I wanted to buy mk470 but bought this keyboard because of bad arrow keys placement in mk470. After having bad experience of this keyboard I've ordered mk470 because arrow keys are not that important for me. Will update this review after using mk470. Would have bought Logitech MX keys but that's out of my budget."
3,"It looks very premium, but not actually one.Finish is nice, but importantly keys are very noisy.There are better keyboards than this at lower price range.Not expected such visual gimmicks from Logitech"
4,Comfortable layout . Good mouse. I like the keyboard too. One glitch I felt is there seems to be a delay on keyboard responsiveness at times when it’s connected to my mac . Not sure if this is a defect
5,Pros:1) Easy to use2) Nice treble to the keys3) Sturdy4) really responsive mouseCons:Practically none except the price if u consider tht.
5,"The keyboard keys are so smooth that it becomes a delightful typing experience. It's an almost no noise keyboard. Can't say the same for the mouse though. The mouse is noisier than it's cheaper counterparts, although the material used gives this mouse a much better feel in hand. The mouse size is medium, neither small nor large. Overall, it's a premium product from Logitech both in terms of looks and feel. Worth the buy."
1,Bad do not order at all part were missing amazon refused return do not order by mistake too
5,"Had second thoughts before buying this product as it was a bit costly. But, i really felt that i have spent the money rightly on this keyboard.Keys are so soft to press and its an amazing experience to type on this keyboard.Mouse also is great to move around, it has soft pads, which makes the moving around so smooth.Finally, really happy with the product."
4,"The quality is as expected from Logitech. Volume keys are 'meh'. Rest is fine. Keys are silent, soft and feels good to type on.The keyboard is huge, it occupies half of my desk and heavy as well. It is wireless, so manageable.It is little overpriced."
5,"Works as advertised. Windows 10 was able to detect it. There is no lag. The keys are good and well placed. Apart from the flat position, there are 2 more positions for tilting the keyboard. There is on/off switch. It has indicator for Caps lock. Happy with the purchase."
5,"Product ia really good, easy to use, works great no issues so far.. but it is very expensive compared to other products with same features. It is NOT ergonomic"
1,"Initially, when I got it, it was awesome. But, after using it for 6 months, I see keys getting stuck, getting hard to press. At this price point, I expected a good keyboard. But, I seriously lost trust in Logitech because of this keyboard. I am moving away from Logitech because of poor warranty service, product performancence.Edit: I forgot to talk about the battery life. I just 1 year, i had to change batteries twice. So, the claims that 3 years battery  life is just plain false"
2,"The left button of the mouse is not functioning and not holding the clicks. I purchased in April-end of this year. It has started to show issues like the other low quality mouse so early.  Keyboard is working fine till now. Except it being well crafted and finish, under the hood, they have the same unreliable quality issues.  Wired ones last much longer and are cheap too. Thought the expensive one will last couple of years but it is all the same. Very disappointed."
5,"It is really work, have used mk275 models as well, but this one is much better in terms of smooth and no noise.  Only thing is hand support and border is bit wide and expanded in comparison with MK275 model.  MK275 is small and portable, but this model is really smooth and one cannot even hear the sound of typing"
5,"old traditional type keyboard with silent keys. good mouse. no complaints.. except it would be nice if numlock sign to be on, but i think it is to save battery. fn key is on the right, some keyboards have them on the left."
5,"1. The weight makes the keyboard stable.2. The keys are soft-touch, yet gives enough feedback.3. The edges of keys are rounded reducing accidental touches on nearby keys.4. Silent.5. The palm rest is useful.6. The size looks big, but if you consider the palm rest area of the table used in other keyboards, it does not take too much space.7. The unifying dongle lets you save on USB adaptor space.8. The power button is good for saving battery."
4,"Just bought this product. Keyboard is nice but mouse size acc. to me is big, who uses such a big size mouse these days. I think logitech should make mouse as optional as I wont be able to use this sized mouse. I need to buy separately and this big mouse will becomes waste as it does not have separate USB receiver."
4,"It's good but isn't the quality that I expected, some keys were shaky and loose and this observation was made by purchasing and then replacing and then returning and then buying again, everyone of those set had this issue but now I have made peace with, but you might find it irritating, battery life is good you can just turn it on for whole day and switch off when you go to sleep, the battery will last you a long time"
5,"Best comfort, Its very soft and mechanical keyboard. There is a caps lock light on the button, you can turn off/on, there are multimedia keys, You can turn on/off Num lock but no indicator. There is a indicator to show your keyboard is on and it turns on only when required."
1,The product is not appropriate and looks like it is used product .I paid the whole amount on purchase and expected a good quality product but product is not upto my expectations .i havent recieved the value for money i tried to invest.Also there is no bill for the keyboard.
4,"Got it for a good price at around 3500 INR. Table is cable free, so happy with product."
1,"Bought it in June 2021, multiple keys have stopped working within 3 months.Both Ctrl key, numeric zero, enter key, etc. are not working.Didn't expect this from such a high-priced keyboard."
1,Keyboard does not give any feedback while writing. Keys are slippery while typing. I wanted to return and re-order logitech 850 but could not because Aamazon now removed return policy for the majority of electronic devices. Ended buying two logitch keyboards because I could not return MK540.
3,"Just received it today, keys and typing is extremely smooth. There are many shortcut keys which are useful, I even found a Function key which will be helpful for laptop users. But only thing I found missing is the brightness adjustment keys.Also the packaging from Amazon was very very poor."
4,Smooth touch keyboard - center point between electronic and mechanical keyboards. The mouse grip is good and well designed for long use.
5,Good product with comfortable usability. Price is on the higher side. Build quality is sturdy and strong. Good product for everyday use. Comes with duracell battery inserted.
5,"Good product.Bluetooth connectivity works seamlessly.Look and keys design is really great.Timeout sleep and wakeup on movement or key press is hastel free.Value for money.Only question is about palm rest thing, I think the length is not enough to put palm on palm rest area and type the keys."
5,"Not a professional post. Just a happy customer of this new technology. The unifier experience has been really good. Having to work from multiple devices, this device helps me to shift by just moving USB port. Keyboard keys are soft and responsive and mouse works very well."
5,Size of the mouse pad is too big which is exactly what I needed. The surface is smooth but the mouse tracking isn’t as good as razer/ steelseries pads. However for the price we paid we got more than what we should get. Edges are quite rough as they are not stitched you might experience hard surface rubbing your skin when you drag mouse.Over all the product is quite good. Hope it will laat more than 6months coz the surface easily gets dusty. Any mousepad with soft surface will be the same so no complains about it. GG
2,"I too bought this mouse pad after reading countless positive reviews. Don’t be fooled by them.I am writing this review after 1 full year of usage (bought this in July 2019, writing in July 2020). I would suggest you to buy a cheaper mouse pad than this, because both would last for the same time.Positive parts - I am giving this 3 star only because of how the mouse pad feels.The sensitivity is really good and mouse feels nice and smooth while on top of the pad.My hand feels comfortable on this pad, because of the gel.Negative parts – After 1-2 months the top layer started to peel a little, over the course of the year, it started to deteriorate rapidly, now the mouse pad’s top layer has almost completely come off, because of poor gluing.The quality of the material is terrible, lasts only for a couple of months.Now I’m forced to buy a new mouse pad after just one year. I expected this to last around 2 years or more.This is Amazon Basics’ original product, wouldn’t expect this bad quality from them.So, think twice before you buy this product."
5,"After a lot of comparison and research I was down to two options for an extended mouse pad - this one and RedGear MP35. Since I had used RedGear in past, I decided to go with AmazonBasics. Here's the comparison between the two:1. Size:Both of their extended versions are perfectly sized to fit any modern table. They are about 2.5 x 3 feet and cover most part of your table. I'd recommend this size if you're a daily/heavy user and a 'large' size if you're a normal user. AmazonBasics one is slightly bigger than RedGear.2. Fabric:Both of these have spandex(nylon + polyester) fabric which is perfect for pads. AmazonBasics feels a lot more premium than RedGear.3. Looks:AmazonBasics looks absolutely stunning with a jet-black colour while the RedGear one has some graphics with red tint on black. It's a user preference basically.4. Sustainability:Both are washable and after multiple washes they show no fabric-tear whatsoever.5. Usage:AmazonBasics is typically used for office/designing/precision while the RedGear is typically used for gaming purpose. However I've used both and there is not much difference in using any one of them for any purpose. Typically AmazonBasics is somewhere between the 'speed' and 'control' type of RedGear.6. Pricing:As of August 2020, AmazonBasics is priced near about Rs. 799 whereas RedGear is around Rs. 499, so it really boils down to your budget.-> Recommendation:Since I've used both - Both are great products, but AmazonBasics feels a lot more premium, looks better and is more versatile. If you're only short on budget, feel free to opt for RedGear one, else just go for this!"
5,"the pad itself gives a very executive look at our computer desk! A very good quality product, it doesn't skid on the surface! I use the mat for gaming as well as for other purposes as well!The only problem I have with this is that its a dust magnet! and since the color is black, its pretty much visible too!"
1,"Nothing exceptional about this ( As one would expect at this price point ). You can get much better options in this price range, also a few that come with led lighting.Durability is the main concern with this, the upper layer of this mousepad got peeled off within a couple of months.Overall a Very Bad product, Specially when you consider the price.Also, in general, avoid any mousepad with such dimensions ( unless you are getting the 1 with LED lighting ), it's a Fail idea, they absord a lot of dust and are very hard to clean, and there is no practical use of the size factor."
3,"Bought the extended one which can hold key board mouse and monitor.The corners have very slight curves which is good, not too sharp and not too curved.But the biggest problem was its a dust magnet and removing fine dust is hectic.Buy this only if your room is ultra clean and does not have a fan.My room was clean but within few hours fine dust was sticking and has to dust them away everytime.There is no return policy which is really bad.Quality apart from the dust sticking issue is good for the price.Also note the mouse pad is a bit rough like the traditional mouse pads unlike the new age mouse pads which have a smooth surface for your mouse to glide, so for gaming that required fast mouse movement this is not rcommended.Apart form that if you have a clean room with AC and looking for a large mouse pad that can hold a monitor base, keyboard and mouse then this is good for it's price mentioned."
5,"I bought this product twice. Once when it initially came out and another one as a replacement a year later.Through the year it gathered a lot of dirt and lost some of its colour and began becoming uncleanable. The edges began to peel off and it started to lose its shape. But it lasted a year and I had paid about 600 rupees for it and find that paying 700 the second time wasn't unreasonable.It a very nice surface to use and quite spacious easily covering my keyboard, mouse and a notebook for jotting things down.It offers a very good amount of grip so rest assured things don't slide off without control on it.Honestly, it's like putting a carpet on a floor. At first it makes all the difference and then eventually you stop noticing it. Once it becomes dirty and looks horrible, you start noticing it again.But worth the price, at least according to me."
1,"This product is huge - you can keep the keyboard and mouse both on top of it with space for a monitor too.As a gaming mouse pad this is functional, but it develops tremendous amount of static and attracts dust - making it impossible to clean. It will be harmful to your computer / electronic components. I have stopped using this as it is simply not practical to clean. Buy a cloth based mouse pad (for example, from Razer) instead."
4,"Bought the extended deskmat for my work desk. It's pretty large, I can keep my keyboard , phone and mouse etc and it doesn't feel cramped. The feel of the surface is decent, not too rough or too smoth. I don't play FPS games so can't comment on mouse tracking but for normal use my mouse works pretty good on this, there is no slipping. Been using it for a few months and so far there hasn't been any problem with the structural integrity of it also.My only problem with this deskmat is that it is a HUGE dust magnet. There's no use trying to wipe it even 5 times a day, it will just grab dust from the air in a matter of seconds. And even single speck of dust on the black surface stands out to the eye. I tried to keep it spotless for the first few days but gave up eventually, dust will be its lifelong friend, I can't separate them."
5,"I've used Razer Goliathus extended fragged control edition and Steelseries Qck+ MYM Edition and both were exactly same size and as the same suggest razer surface was rough and steelseries variant was smooth but I was looking for a extended mousepad so I can keep my keyboard on it as well and this turned out to be a great purchase and a worthy product for writing a  review.I've always liked Amazon Basics products as eventhough they try to cut costs but still most of the products tends to be on a durable and ideal for price they charge and I got this mousepad for about Rs 429/- in a random sale which for me is a steal!For both of my aforementioned mousepads I paid about 1500 each back in 2009 when I bought them and they've served me well over the years but this sure is a satisfactory upgrade.Pros :-1) The size of this thing is enormous even for a traditional extended mousepad - I have both my keyboard and mouse and still have space left to keep lots of junk and even food plate on it.2) Great quality as I keep hot food on the surface many times and it takes it like a champ unlike other brands like razer who's rubber start melting from a lil heat.3) If you're someone who can't decide that you want  a soft smooth surface pad or a rugged control edition, this one will be ideal as it's somewhere between.Cons :- 1) The surface is not so smooth and might feel rough to some palm grip users users like me who have razer deathadder2) The edges are not breaded so they'll tear and can cause discomfort for some people.Add this on your wish list & try to grab this on the next lightning deal.For the price, size and quality this is a no brainier!"
5,I wanted a small mouse pad that could serve the purpose of casual gaming and yet not cost too much. After some research i decided to go for this over Steelseries Mini as it was unreasonably overpriced. By the way they both have the same specs so you can go for whatever you like more. You do get a Steelseries sticker with the Steelseries Mini but that should not be the deciding factor. The same sticker you get with their Sims 4 mouse pad too but that's not for gaming. I also got an additional 20% discount coupon on the default price so i was bound to go for Amazon Basics. I am using this mouse pad with
4,"so as the title says, stitched edges would have been better. the edge is sharp and will hurt you because it burrs. in other word the sharp edge becomes rough and will poke your wrist/ arm.the attached photo shows what i am talking about... those little burrs poke your skin.i fixed mine by putting micropore tape on the edge. this tape is the only tape that will stick to surfaces like these.better to to go with stitched edge mat.negatives aside, this mat is big and especially useful if you have wireless mouse because you can keep it on anywhere on the surface and use it.it will accommodate a full size keyboard and a mouse and still have space left."
4,"Initial review after 1 month of usage- Material quality is very good so far- The Amazon basics logo on the pad looks very cool- The mouse is working well on the pad. Did not face any issue with the precision so far. Pretty smooth- Size received as was mentioned on the product page- Just one star less for two things1. There is no stitching on the borders to give more life2. The pad attracts dust, just that you would need to clean it everyday (not a big issue though)Final verdict - Value for money. Great product."
5,Good quality soft mat for placing your laptop and mouse. I don't use it at all for gaming because I am hardly a gamer.  The mat is quite thick and soft to touch. Also it is a quite long and covers almost the whole of the table length. Wish it were shorter by about 6 inches to accommodate only the laptop and mouse. Been using it for about a week now. Durability can be decided only after a few more weeks of usage. One observation - the mat is quite thick and soft and it may block the exhaust vents of the laptop and may create heating issues for prolonged use.  Wish the mat was a bit hard to support the laptop so that the exhaust vents are not blocked.
3,"The material of the pad is durable. I am now using this for over a year and the pad has proven to be durable too. And it is washable. However, given it's color, it quickly catches dust and that dust is very visible on the black surface, as is the case with anything that is a dark coloured surface. This means, it needs frequent washing if you like this to always look clear. In summary:Pros:- Durable- Washable- Right size- Yields good mouse sensitivityCons:- Gets dirty due to dark color and hence requires frequent washing.If there was an option of a dark gray or dark brown color, I would now prefer that rather than the dark black color of this pad."
1,The size mentioned in description is wrong.Description says: Measures 36.22 By 11.57 By .12 Inches (920 by 300 by 3 mm)Actual size is 902 by 429 by 2mm  (the height is about 13cm more)The height for me is more than the space I have and is completely useless for me.Also the edges are sharp and hurt the skin while using mouse. Would not recommend. Surprising that Amazon has inaccurate info on listings for their own products.Couldn't return as it is replacement only. Money wasted.
5,"It's nice durable and a good looking mouse pad.  Unlike the regular hard board ones, it is flexible and can be rolled and un rolled and can be laid on uneven surface.Surface has good enough friction to roll the mouse with satisfactory response time.Above all it looks elegant when paired with your expensive laptops or desk tops."
3,"MINIThe ratings make them look like they are the best out there but in my experience with the mini mouse pad, it isn't that great. Within 5 months of use, the rubber and cloth started to separate on the edges. The material is good, the branding looks good, but I don't think with the kind of use I've done, the state of this pad should have been this bad. So I'd recommend to maybe look for other options too.EXTENDEDLooks more rugged than the mini. Can not comment on how long the cloth might stick as I just used it for 3 days. The overall experience with extended pad was good apart from the fact that it was too big for my need. And it's not 90*30 but somewhere around 90*42. If that's something you want, then this might be a good buy."
4,The cloth is probably laser cut and is made of synthetic material. Hence the cutting leaves an edge that is rough and may feel sharp to the softer skin on the underside of the arm. Noticed a few reviews that mention sharp edges causing injury. I fixed it partially by cutting off the edge at an angle and 2 by overhanging an inch of the cloth over the edge of the table
4,"It's a very good product. Gets stuck to the table once you lay it down, stays there until you take it out, does not move while using. The black color is highly pristine & gives a classy look. The only down side is, attracts dust & easily visible since the black is so dominant. But again a very good buy, if you are looking for a stable product this is ""The One"". The size is exactly what's mentioned in the description & absolutely perfect for my desk. ""Go For It""Happy Shopping"
5,"I had been using the Large size mouse pad since very long. After purchasing this extended model, I feel buying the smaller one was a stupid move. Though, no doubt all their models are equally great when it comes to quality and usability but, the extended one feels slightly more thicker and premium. And why not, one has to pay more out of ones’s pocket but, that extra money won’t pinch you once the product gets delivered at your door step and you start using it. Genuinely best for the current WFH period."
5,"It is an excellent output. I had ordered when the lighting deal was running. Many time I tried to call, but always stock was empty.Well build quality of the product prevails the loyalty of the producers or producer. The edges were so smooth stitching. The mousepad can hold the clutch.It just covers the maximum area of my desk, which helps me place my 2.1 speakers partly and the keyboard and the mouse.Anyway, I have not soaked this product, so I can't tell you how it will react after wash. But I am sure it will undoubtedly maintain its quality.In conclusion, I could see how Amazon carries a quality of products and services to their patrons and help them to satisfy with every product they brought from their theatre."
5,Damn nice. Was skeptical after reading a few reviews stating the edges hurt the hand etc. but it’s all BS. I play about 40 hours a week and have had no such issues. I was initially going to get the Hyper X extended mousepad but since it was out of stock bought this for the time being. As I have G502 which has a braided cable it gets stuck at the edges when I try to reposition it but I guess there’s only a limited number of things one can get at this price.
4,"Perfectly sized mouse pad for gamers who use arm type aiming with low sensitivity & large strokes of mouse movements.Some reviewers had complained about sharp edges but if you adjust the mouse pad slightly on your table, there won't be any level of discomfort from the edges. I particularly never experienced the sharp edges issue.Mouse pad surface is quite grippy & doesn't move along with your hand movements thereby giving much needed stability.Upper surface is quite smooth & similar to speed type mouse pads. Although it gets dirty pretty soon if you live in a dusty enviornment. Washing with a shampoo is the easiest way to clean it.Overall satisfied with the product & would highly recommend for arm gamers."
4,"Amazon basics, I read somewhere what they do is for a product they look at all the manufactures and user's rating and then come up with reasonable and good product under their umbrella. I have in the past brought few items and never got disappointed. So is the case with this item. Its very good item.  Few people mentioned in the review that it has sharp edges, but the item I got it was not the case. Its very smooth.Go for it"
5,"When I purchased the 'AmazonBasics Extended Gaming Mouse Pad Black' I was not clear about the size. So, when I received the item, I could come to know that its size was too big.  So, I contacted Amazon and requested for return.  After considering my past purchases over time and reviewing my case as per their internal guidelines, Amazon promptly arranged for return and subsequent refund.  Thank you Amazon.  Though, I did not use I can say that the item is evidently sturdy and easy to clean."
4,IT feels good but dust accumulates fast and is very noticeable.Thankfully all you have to do to clean it is just slightly wiggle it holding it by the shorter sides and most of the dust will come of. You can also hand wash it in cold water for a more thorough cleaning.Its dimensions are a bit bigger than what the website says but I didn't have any problems with it.
5,"If your going from cheap on to a premium one. This is definitely one of the best if not the best in this range. Using this as a programmer and it works really well. Sound is pretty good too. Keyboard light doesnt work. Mouse light works. After using this mouse, every mouse will seem bad quality. Key above tab key, the one that is left to 1 no key does not write what is printed on it. ~ this one. This key prints something else."
5,Perfect product for gaming or even as a work surface spread. It gets rid of the hassle of small mouse pads. It is reasonably easy to clean. The edges may fray over time but I have not used it for long enough to say so. Cannot write on a sheet of paper once this product is spread if it covers most of the work surface but that is not a product deficiency. Great product overall.
5,Amazon is trying to get a market for its private lable and they are doing a damn fine job. This is absolute value for yoir money. The mouse pad is really good and it has plenty of space to hold your keyboard mouse and several other gadgets. Gaming performance... Well I am not that kind of a bitchy person so I didn't realize any difference from my old mouse pad but it is really good to rest my hand on the pad. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it kinda gets dusty soon. So unless you have an AC room think twise about throwing more than 500Inr on this. But if you can handle that just shut up and buy this. Happy shopping!
3,"I have got two issues:-1) the top keys on the number key pad don't match. But since they were play/pause, stop and next+previous play keys, I didn't bother. The second issues is a major one.2) it doesn't really support bak lit keys. I have a lenovo 330s and just to prove my point I have attached a photo, so others can see before making a purchase. Read on further,Rest is perfectly fine, it's sleek, smooth, it sticks to the keyboard pretty well, fits it well, but for nocturnal creatures who like to work in the dark, be prepared to remove it every once in a while you work in the dark. I would have given four stars but inability to display backlit keyboard is a big bummer. Yes, the back-light is visible but the keys are not at all intelligible. You wouldn't know if you pressed an 'm' or an 'n'... 2.5-3 stars because it nonetheless will keep your device keys clean and is pretty smooth to touch and press keys, and it's sleekness. You can buy it, I dont know if there are other alternatives to this make the seller could post if he has those products. Else I'll probably just keep it. Thanks for reading. Hope it helps."
4,"First you will fell like purchasing it but when u use it ,it's not that comfortable. Bulit quality is good and keys are visible properly. But the led light on the key is not visible. All together it is good 👍 ."
1,"Covers the entire keyboard. very thin apt for all keys.. BUT it does not support the backlight keyboard.. false description given for the product.. fonts visible in the pic above is just a white print and it is not transparent, attaching two pics.. with and without the keyboard skin..check the second pic you will relaize it's nit supporting the backlight keyboard. Huge disappointment."
3,"The product fits amazing to my Y540 but I have found the proudct quality good too but price charged for the product is nearly double. While the same product could have been priced at 200 aprox would be a good option.Also I would suggest any1 purchasing the product go with the transperent one as it gives amazing view and all the keys are visible, where as the black one doesnt allow the backlight to show the krys at night."
5,"I don’t usually review stuff on Amazon but I thought its my duty to save time of the buyers.This keyguard is really good one; Close your eyes and buy it. Also, I had ordered this for Lenovo Ideapad S540 and this fits perfectly fine"
5,Two or three keys are different with their symbol and command as compared to your keyboard laptop..But fits perfectly and another issue isYour backlight keyboard will be hided after applying on your laptop keyboard.....but somehow it is visible on starting your backlit..Overall 5 out of 4
4,The keypad is opaque- Have to lift up the cover to check if the power botton light is on. Also it is difficult to get dirt off the cover- the dirt sticks to it.
4,Product is as described. Fits well. Very good material. I am giving 4 out of 5. Deducing a point for the fact that one cannot see the caps lock or power led at all.
5,"Loved the product,Has perfect Thickness and is value for money.I will recommend Amazon customers to buy this product."
5,"Nice product.Proper thickness. Material is good. Keyboard Protection wise best.. Perfect size for laptop lenovo idealpad 330S.Keys are enough visible, bit problem to visualize capslock and numlock status."
5,Very nice .it's for t exactly to my keyboard. The quality was so good and premium
5,Fits perfectly on my 15.6 inch laptop. Dosent shake or move while using the laptop. Satisfied with this product. Looks like a part of the laptop. You would stop noticing it after a while.👍
5,Print & Insert key is interchanged rest It's good and perfect on size. Very useful to protect keyboard from dust and water. Only suggestion is to take transparent one instead of black as key light gets blocked with black one. Rest all good.
1,Quality Not good heavy price
4,Nice item it protects your key board from dust and it is very easy to clean and it is washable also
5,"Good product, fits as expected.."
5,Nice product. Perfect fit
3,Not good for backlit keyboard. Once enable backlit not able see the transparent key or Capslk or Num lock.It is recommended for normal keyboard.Don't buy who have backlit key board. :(
5,I have ordered this for my Lenovo IDEAPAD 330E-151KB U model. Its well fitted and easy to clean and wash. Value for money.
1,It's damn tough to stick this screen protector. The steps which have been provided on the manual are very complicated. I ended up losing my money on this product.
5,Fits perfectly on my Lenovo IdeaPad slim 3...... Good quality product..... Forth it
3,Ok product. wallet is good but little costly
4,I was ordered Black color for Lenovo S540. Its fit verywell.. nice product....
5,100 percent exact fit
5,I thick this is only best option to choose and not any otherother transparent covers 😆
4,"I ordered this product for my ideapad s540, it is perfect for it. But, cost is too much for the product quality."
1,Keys on protector doesnt fit properly for lenovo ideapad
5,Great stuff for the price
1,The product delivered and the picture shown doesn't match ! pathetic service !
5,awesome product fits my laptop's keyboard
5,Awesome product...fit to keyboard
5,Nic product ..Perfect fit and look
5,Good
5,fits well
5,I m using it daily and roughly. It is a very good product.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,I wish I could give it a half star
5,Beyond expectation.
5,Perfect fit for my laptop.
5,The product is good. 🤙
4,Before buying the product I was worried whether it would fit my keyboard appropriately. But the fitting is absolutely perfect. There is cutting for touchid. Highly recommended product for your keyboard.
5,"Very nice product, fitted very well. but little much costlier."
5,I ordered this keyboard for special purpose. The keyboard which I was using before was of laptop which was getting dusty and so much ruff after use. Then I decided to go for external accessory keyboard to prevent from rust. This one is slip model and perfect for working. Value for money product and best for gaming application and office work.
5,"I wanted a white-colored keyboard to go with my monitor and mouse at home. There are very few options out there and I was looking for a wireless one which I couldn't find, instead, I had to settle for this wired one. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about buying this keyboard as there weren't too many reviews, although the ones that are there, are quite promising. Its been about 2 months since I got this keyboard and I am quite happy with it. The chicklet keys mimic the behavior of your laptop keyboard, so it makes it easier to type. The spacing between the keys are just right for you to hit the ones that you want.There is also a Rupee key which you need to install to get working. The installation process is provided on the box and is quite simple. For a budget keyboard, this one turned out to be really good and I am glad I took the risk."
5,"Using this Keyboard for my office work from the past 3 weeks... and I am very happy with this Keyboard. The keys are soft for typing.... since i am using it extensively.... very comfortable.Wondering why there are fewer orders for this product.... have used other good name brands.. but this keyboard is the best at this price. One can surely go for this without any second thoughts.Pros:1. Chiclet keys are very smooth for typing2. The Caps lock, Num lock led's r so bright.. very good to see them at night3. Good product at a very reasonable priceCons: I don't see any after 3 weeks of continuous usageOverall satisfaction: 5/5"
5,"At the first time I received the keyboard but the left control key didn't seem to be proper. Then I got it replaced. Now it works really well and it also feels premium. The replacement was also fast and hassle free. Overall, it is a great product !"
5,"Just started using it!This keyboard seems to be very promising. Sturdy built quality, elegant looks and soft tuch to the buttons."
5,"Bought this as I couldn't get the Dell 216 in white colour, but this alternative is totally worth it. It is a premium keyboard, and the multimedia keys are awesome eg. there is a key for opening explorer directly into 'This PC' tab, which I need a lot. The browser tab opens chrome, which is my default browser. Keys are awesome to type, and i wanted chicklet keys as i find it easy to type with my laptop keyboard which has chicklet keys. The finish is very good, with metallic edges and overall very good design. Awesome, that too at this low price. The white colour is not too bright, has a very slight beige-like tinge. I checked each key, and it is working very well, making lesser noise than my laptop keyboard keys. But i have just tried it for a few minutes, so will update the review after a month of use...but the quality of the keyboard and even the good packing, seems professional and doesn't seem like it will give problems anytime soon. Rupee key is a bonus, but it requires you to install some drives, and the lengthy process is given on the box; would have liked it out-of-the-box, but then, windows does not have that font. Another con is that the multimedia keys require you to press the 'Function' key, so one hand operation is not present. But on the other hand, 12 multimedia keys is a good thing anyway, though you may not use some keys like 'stop' and 'Favourites'. (I assume the last key is 'favourites' but it isn't doing anything, so not sure if it is really for browser 'favourites' or something else, or if it is just not functional! Overall, a very nice keyboard. The cheapest and best if you don't want to use a boring black keyboard! (P.S this review is the first thing I have typed with this keyboard!)"
4,The key travel is not that good. The keys are flat keys which doesn't have any curving which make it a little problematic for me while typing faster. The space bar is a little loose. But for this price its a good one compared to the other products in this price range.
5,you will love typing on this keyboard. Makes little noise like all other keyboard. But very smooth keyboard.
5,zebronics keyboard super nice keyboard..its like alaptop model chicklet keyboard...its very convenient to working...excellent keyboard...i love this keyboard..
5,Best chiclet keyboard in this price range love this💯💯🔥❤️
5,Perfect keyboard and easy to type fast
5,Works very well. Smooth keys. Value for money. Light weight and sleek.
5,I have using for typing with mobile phone
5,Wasn't expecting the keyboard to be this good for the amount I paid. I am liking it.
4,"Using for couple of months now.Product is built with good condition and keys are stiff. Typing experience is not that great, its kind of okay considering the price point. You will get used to it. Overall good keyboard"

5,Excellent for the price.
5,"Very nice keyboard, easy to type, soft keys, will order another if required in future."
5,Good Product
5,For good programers and for fast typing
5,Valueable keybord awsome...
5,I ordered this keyboard for special purpose. The keyboard which I was using before was of laptop which was getting dusty and so much ruff after use. Then I decided to go for external accessory keyboard to prevent from rust. This one is slip model and perfect for working. Value for money product and best for gaming application and office work.
5,"I wanted a white-colored keyboard to go with my monitor and mouse at home. There are very few options out there and I was looking for a wireless one which I couldn't find, instead, I had to settle for this wired one. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about buying this keyboard as there weren't too many reviews, although the ones that are there, are quite promising. Its been about 2 months since I got this keyboard and I am quite happy with it. The chicklet keys mimic the behavior of your laptop keyboard, so it makes it easier to type. The spacing between the keys are just right for you to hit the ones that you want.There is also a Rupee key which you need to install to get working. The installation process is provided on the box and is quite simple. For a budget keyboard, this one turned out to be really good and I am glad I took the risk."
5,"Using this Keyboard for my office work from the past 3 weeks... and I am very happy with this Keyboard. The keys are soft for typing.... since i am using it extensively.... very comfortable.Wondering why there are fewer orders for this product.... have used other good name brands.. but this keyboard is the best at this price. One can surely go for this without any second thoughts.Pros:1. Chiclet keys are very smooth for typing2. The Caps lock, Num lock led's r so bright.. very good to see them at night3. Good product at a very reasonable priceCons: I don't see any after 3 weeks of continuous usageOverall satisfaction: 5/5"
5,"At the first time I received the keyboard but the left control key didn't seem to be proper. Then I got it replaced. Now it works really well and it also feels premium. The replacement was also fast and hassle free. Overall, it is a great product !"
5,"Just started using it!This keyboard seems to be very promising. Sturdy built quality, elegant looks and soft tuch to the buttons."
5,"Bought this as I couldn't get the Dell 216 in white colour, but this alternative is totally worth it. It is a premium keyboard, and the multimedia keys are awesome eg. there is a key for opening explorer directly into 'This PC' tab, which I need a lot. The browser tab opens chrome, which is my default browser. Keys are awesome to type, and i wanted chicklet keys as i find it easy to type with my laptop keyboard which has chicklet keys. The finish is very good, with metallic edges and overall very good design. Awesome, that too at this low price. The white colour is not too bright, has a very slight beige-like tinge. I checked each key, and it is working very well, making lesser noise than my laptop keyboard keys. But i have just tried it for a few minutes, so will update the review after a month of use...but the quality of the keyboard and even the good packing, seems professional and doesn't seem like it will give problems anytime soon. Rupee key is a bonus, but it requires you to install some drives, and the lengthy process is given on the box; would have liked it out-of-the-box, but then, windows does not have that font. Another con is that the multimedia keys require you to press the 'Function' key, so one hand operation is not present. But on the other hand, 12 multimedia keys is a good thing anyway, though you may not use some keys like 'stop' and 'Favourites'. (I assume the last key is 'favourites' but it isn't doing anything, so not sure if it is really for browser 'favourites' or something else, or if it is just not functional! Overall, a very nice keyboard. The cheapest and best if you don't want to use a boring black keyboard! (P.S this review is the first thing I have typed with this keyboard!)"
4,The key travel is not that good. The keys are flat keys which doesn't have any curving which make it a little problematic for me while typing faster. The space bar is a little loose. But for this price its a good one compared to the other products in this price range.
5,you will love typing on this keyboard. Makes little noise like all other keyboard. But very smooth keyboard.
5,zebronics keyboard super nice keyboard..its like alaptop model chicklet keyboard...its very convenient to working...excellent keyboard...i love this keyboard..
5,Best chiclet keyboard in this price range love this💯💯🔥❤️
5,Perfect keyboard and easy to type fast
5,Works very well. Smooth keys. Value for money. Light weight and sleek.
5,I have using for typing with mobile phone
5,Wasn't expecting the keyboard to be this good for the amount I paid. I am liking it.
4,"Using for couple of months now.Product is built with good condition and keys are stiff. Typing experience is not that great, its kind of okay considering the price point. You will get used to it. Overall good keyboard"

4,"I received this product today which was super quickBelow are the things i noticed.1. The material used is a strong foam type, its not made of cloth/cotton which i feel is good, it can be cleaned easily.2. The mouse cannot be used on this, i tried using it but its bit difficult and you may miss on the accuracy of clicks.3. Can be folded into half. Stitches are strong.4. A feedback for the seller, the layer of leather stitched on top is already tearing off because of folding. Its not an issue but should be improved."
1,"Let me tell you why you should get this1. If you plan to use this on your desk to keep your gadgets and accessoriesWhy you shouldn't get this1. The material used is a dust magnet and is not recommended if you have asthma or any respiratory diseases2. It will like I said, is a dust magnet meaning if you move around things especially if you keep mouse on top of it and move around it's going to leave dirt patches/smudges (looks really bad)"
5,"I was looking for something to protect my Desk from scratches of daily laptop movement.Finally I found this, very economical in price, quality is superb compare to price.It has 2 pouch as well to put some papers or diary.My purpose is to use as laptop mat only and not gaming, so not sure how it works for gamingFor normal office desk purose it's just amazing product. Loved it a lot."
2,"Sorry,  but the product is not worth the price. 2 thin layers of fabric stitched together. I bought it at 475, it should be priced at less than half of what i bought it for. Basically, consider some other manufacturer since this doesn't serve the purpose. It is as good as a soft cloth underneath your palm. There is zero cusioning."
5,It's a slick and good looking deskpad. I was looking for something to do with gaming but this looks great for a work desk too. Helps me declutter my desk with its pocket spaces for papers and cards. I use a mouse pad for my mouse and keep my keyboard on the product. It is big enough for both but I prefer it this way.
1,The fibres are too damn sharp and the mat is really coarse.Overall a huge disappointment
5,i realy like the two pouches where when not in use i can keep my ipad pro and my 14 inch laptop . the quality is amazing !.
1,Defective material sent twice. Wrinkles on felt.
5,Good product
4,Not superb duper. But ok
4,It does its job. No pen holder as mentioned in the description.
5,Super like !!
4,It’s ok
5,Nice for office desk
4,Very useful product 👌👌👌👌
5,Good in quality
5,Nice
5,Fully usefull product fully satisfied quality is best and price is best.Thanks amazon
4,"Sleek. Lightweight. Bang for buck.No one would argue on the fact that Logitech products have degraded their quality in last decade and they do not last as long as they used to, the usability their products provide for the cost we as a consumer pay are still unbeatable.This keyboard (which comes with a mouse) have smooth and soft to press switches, which would get rougher eventually as dust settles in it.I had logitech K120 previously. A couple of switches went out after few years of use. Knowing the fact that logitech is not as reliable as it used to be, I doubt it would last ""5 Million keystrokes"" as it suggests on the packaging.It feels easy to type though I would have loved a bigger ""Enter"" key rather than a slim key.  Space key is huge and more than comfortable to continually press it with thumb. The keys have different sounds which is a nice engineering touch. Overall, Good keyboard for the money.Mouse on the other hand felt on the cheaper side. Clicks are way to soft. Scrolling has sufficient and good feedback but the clicks feel a little too softer than it should. I've had multiple cheaper mouse of some random companies that felt more ergonomic, comfortable and good to click.Thats just my honest opinion. Overall, a good combo for the price of 799 Indian rupees for daily use. I would not recommend it for gaming. Choose a good mechanical keyboard for gaming instead of this."
4,"Good Product, Easy to use. But when i recieve the product Alt and space button was broken. But i fixed it. But keyboard is very soft when we type. Value for money"
4,I liked the product but the only doubt I have is that serial number mention on packaging and serial number on the back side of keyboard does not match which makes me think that it is not genuine. Not sure if this is normal !!
5,"I bought this Logitech MK120 Keyboard Mouse set in offer. Here I would like to review it in points-1] Quality: ★★★★★Build Quality of this Logitech MK120 is brilliant. Key press is soft and quick. Made of high quality plastic material.2] Brand: ★★★★★I've used Intex, Frontech keyboard/mouse but there is no match to this keyboard mouse. Logitech been trusted brand for me since 13 years. Loved it's products.3] Price: ★★★★★I got it in offer and current price is 900 which is absolutely worth it.4] Inside Box:There is Logitech Keyboard and Mouse in this Box.5] Warranty: ★★★★★Comes with 3 year manufacturer warranty. Which is absolutely brilliant. (Water spill, physical damage doesn't cover the warranty)"
3,"I bought this in emergency because my Apple Keyboard went bad and I wanted a replacement ASAP and next day delivery was possible for this product. I expected a normal keyboard/mouse without bells and whistles that would get the job done. What I did not expect was to get a broken mouse out of the box.The mouse came assembled wrong in the box and it's wire hanging out from its side. Upon further inspection, it seems like it was also forced closed when being packed which broke one of its clip. I did not want to be left without a keyboard so return is out of question. I'm just keeping the combo for its keyboard."
5,"The packaging was worst , also the mouse were disassembled , But the main Part the Products are excellent.. the Logitech B100 is famous mouse and we we get the same mouse deer but with different colour also you can check Logitech b100 on Amazon overall it's a perfect choice under 700 or 800 rupees just go for it...."
5,I bought an HP keyboard just to try out another brand. The top number keys and some other keys stopped working within 1 month. I couldn't locate a service center. The HP website does not even list keyboards! During sale I bought this and I am loving it. Feels very sturdy. I already have a Logitech mouse so I know the product will be good. Definitely recommend if you don't mind the ordinary looks. Feels really good to use.
2,Its a value for money product if you get all in one piece. Very Poor quality control. So on your luck.(1) Seals are broken for the box. Other customer pointed the same. Though product seems new or like new.(2) Mouse is delivered broken. Similar issue reported by many other users.(3) A large package housed a small product box. Keyboard was outside the box when it was delivered.
5,"I liked the prompt delivery even in this situation of COVID. The product delivered is genuine and contains the mouse and  keyboard in very good condition. Logitech is a very nice brand so you can close your eyes and purchase it. The smoothness of the keyboard is what I like most.It creates the typing sound a little more than normal , so if you dont want to disturb others around then this can be a problem. This is the only flaw"
4,"It's been almost 4 months since i bought them and if i say they are one of the best. i won't hesitate. if you are low on budget and want the best combo here you go. i got it for 550 which was a pretty good deal and mainly what attracted me was the goodwill of the brand logitech and the 3 year warranty which we get with this product, i compared it with many other reputed brands but i was not satisfied until i found them."
5,"You basically get everything you ask for , a great high quality keyboard and mouse combo which are simply plug and play. All keys are great and have very low actuation force . Mouse is great too with an amazing ergonomic design . I have a big palm and it fits really nicely into my hands. No issues while using . And afterall , it's Logitech ! It will work for years ! Must buy."
4,Nice key board and mouse at 800 rupees  .It is connected to my smart tv and it is very use full you can blindly buy this at this price..but mouse quality should be little bit improved and both keys and mouse are very soft to use .. over all i liked it..😊😍
5,"This keyboard is a absolute workhorse. The keys are a little clacky which is fine by me, I actually kind of like it. It's comfortable to type on. Keys don't get stuck as on some mechanical keyboards. The mouse is light, quite silent and gets the job done. Well worth the cost."
4,"It's a decent set of Keyboard and mouse; given the price. I bought it for 750inr during the diwali sale.There is no problem with the set i received and its working fine.( After 2weeks)I would say if you want a basic keyboard and mouse, then go for it. ( ***Don't buy it for gaming)It might seem a bit cheap in the begining(especially the mouse)  but its a decent product ,it works fine and you will get adjusted to it in 3-4 days.As far as i have used it: i have had no problems."
1,"The title may be inaccurate but please read on.Seller Appario is sending old/used pieces to customers. I received the box with seal already open, and it was smashed. The keyboard also has a few keys not working."
5,"Perfact product, good seller, recommend this keyboard & mouse. Fast delivery. Good packing. Genuine seller. Good product. I personally like this deal."
3,"I only use key board for a month, two keys Left Side Shift and Space bar are having problem.Some times it is not working, need to press very hard to work.I wished i brought some other keyboard.Thanks"
5,"I got this combo for my sons online school. The keyboard is a gratifying soft click and mouse is simple and decent. Most mouse scroll wheels give in under a few month, I don’t know if it happen to this mouse. I’ll give an update after a few months.Most importantly the quality that one expected when buying Logitech is there and that’s what matters."
4,"Writing review after 2+ months of use.+Points . Keys are good , they dont make tak tak sound.. looks sturdy. No keys are loose yet. Mouse is good size.- points. The stand keeps comming out. Wire quality seems to be thin compared to my company provided lenovo keyboard mouse."
5,"Used for daily office work. Doesn't look like a good opi for gaming. But for every day work, it's perfect. Had used Logitech mouse and keyboard before and they are really good in quality. Keyboard feels good in hand and keystrokes are very comfortable. Mouse is very light in weight and clicks are accurate too.I recommend this product."
3,"You can go for MK200 Series. You will get specific control keys for music, sleep, calculator and all, also MK200 design is better than this & good quality also. Just 100rs difference."
5,Keyboard provides good feedback but the wire is too thin and looks weak. Mouse feels cheap and scroll wheel feels flimsy. Wire is also very fragile and looks like it can break easily. But it is working fine for me since 1 month.
5,"Good product working properly, before I brought other brand does not work, logitech is good product"
4,"Good keyboard with nice comfortable keys not very soft and still with good robust feedback. Not very cheap or expensive, good for regular use"
5,Reliable products and low price. So far so good.
1,"I received a used/opened product, however, I do not want to return it as I have a lot of office work and dont have enough time. This time I really not happy for this order."
3,"After a month sometimes left mouse button works as right mouse button it becomes irritating as when you click the left button right click option pops up, trying to figure out how to apply for warranty.Keyboard is fine."
4,The build quality of Logitech keyboard mouse combo is superior.its worth spending few hundred bucks more for quality.Sturdy build . Using with laptop for office use.
1,Useless product from Longitech . Mouse Is not working properly after 1 month of use
4,Product is good. Does its job perfectly. The only thing is.. keyboard is a bit noisy.
5,"Before it,Purchased same keyboard but blooth but that cause break in typing.But this wireless is going smoothly. no problem 👍"
5,Got it in a lighting deal just few days before lock down. It helped me boost my productivity while working from home.
5,First impressions are too good...keys are really very soft. In wired keyboard I found it one of the best available keyboards right now..keys are very smooth..you are definitely going to love it
2,The seal and box is open from right side. The keyboard and mouse are looking new and working. I am not sure if the product is refurbished or new or used.
5,Yes definitely value for money.. as my requirements of typing its softness suits me very well. I am  comfortable with this stready keyboard and light weight mouse..
4,The product is simple and it is easy to use. I won't say it is dedicated for gaming but it does a decent job while gaming. Other than gaming i would always prefer this.
1,As of now i have found - and = keys are not working properly. Need to very press hardly to get the values.
5,One of the best combo keyboard and mouse in market. Don't go for others cheap price. Though this are on high on cost for some people but the comfort to use is awesome.
5,One of the best purchase I had...Work fine..And the packing was excellent...
5,Very comfortable to write codes hours after hours with these smooth keys of the keyboard. Using this combo gives me significant sense of difference with any other keyboards. Higher price than other products is in that sense justified.
2,Video Player is loading.
2,Do not buy this product it's having a serious compatibility driver issue with my laptop which is asus rog strix g and it's running windows 10 home 20H2 build.Most importantly this product is not listed on the Hp india page and it's showing S/N is also invalid in HP india page. If you want a mechanical keyboard then go for the other HP keyboard gaming models.
5,Its a standard backlit keyboard that can be used for both office and entertainment.Its metallic with plastic key caps.The keys are very comfortable to type and feels very 'clicky'. The key spacing is appropriate. The keys are well visible in daylight without having to turn back-lights on unlike some other backlit keyboards. It has 4 brightness levels and several lighting modes. Though dynamic lighting is not supported in this yet the lighting modes makes a great ambience.Its overall a bang for the buck. Buy it during sales for best price. Lets hope it lasts long.Recommended!!
1,"It looks like mechanical, but it is not mechanical. Misleaded by HP. You will find, there is mechanical switches under the keycaps. But if you teardown the keyboard, you see the real picture. There is a circular membrane under each of the mechanical switches. The mechanical switches are false and it just triggers the membrane."
4,"Keys are a bit wobbly. I have a right shift key that occasionally gets stuck( not because the key itself, the keycap gets stuck under another key cap when pressed). But other than that keyboard is really good. Based on the height of your chair, you may or may not need a arm rest for the keyboard. Buttons are clicky and are really good with response times. I play valorant fortnite and league of legends. Never had any delays or problems. It does have anti ghosting. So thats a bonus. The keyboard is really good for its price.but If you are looking for something very robust then probably go for Logitech g213 or higher."
1,"Keyboard was fine for initial 4 months then the ""S"" key stopped working . I use it only for occasional gaming and very light use 3-4 times a week max . When I tried to claim warranty since it is just 4 months old and should come under 1 year warranty (not 3 yrs as advertised by the seller) , I couldn't find this keyboard listed on HP's website . Meaning I can't claim warranty for it as I can't register it for warranty in the first place. I will need to open the keyboard and sacrifice some other switch and solder it in place of ""S"" key since the knock off blue switches are proprietary and not standard ones so keycaps aren't leveled. I'd say go for a keyboard with Hot swappable keys or just buy a soldering iron with the keyboard ."
5,"First of all, The keyboard is the best option under 2k. No questions asked. The main highlight is the blue switch. It's a rebranded outemu blue switch. A little bit of search reveals that. Outemus are typically the first copy of cherry MX and a good one in that regard. So no issues with the switches. Coming to Keycaps, they are not bad and not great either. If the Keycap is lost or you wanna change it to som le other one, you need to account for the excess stem length of the keycap. Any Universal keycap that have recessed/inline stem will hit the aluminium top panel and cause reverberation. The brightness is okayish, and the RGB is not technically RGB but color lightning. It can't be changed and has a ton of effects. The stabilization of keys are okayish except that the space key is a bit hard to press when compared to others. If you're planning to buy this for fps gaming, don't. Get a brown or black switches. Don't go for red either. Blue's clicky sound will make you go crazy when you're pressing keys fast. Black will be the best option for gaming imo. But for everyone else, Blue's are the way to go. Whether you're a developer or editor, get this."
1,This keyboard my friend bought is good one but mine is very different. It looks like this is either A copy duplicate product or the quality is degraded from HP side. Not a good choice for using as a coder. You can't type fast. The keys are shaking.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,Very Soon It started giving problems like the secind day itself it started double typing and chattering and keys sometimes get stuck.
4,Video Player is loading.
5,"Amaing keyboard, worth every penny. Love it 🤘"
5,It is a brilliant keyboardI have learnt Typewriting and I purchased this for fast typing it is very good product in reasonable price(1790) rupees onlyI am very satisfied with this productBut only thing I didn't like was I got returned product (means somebody returned it and I got the product)But let it be the product was having no damage only the box was teared from one side
2,"I was either sent a refurbished keyboard acting as new or the build quality is disappointing. Or both. Keypresses often result in ddouble outpuut and modifier key combinations (Shift or Ctrl) are unreliable, with either WWWWAY too many letters or nothing at all.This is possibly a refurbished keyboard acting as new since a lot of these issues happen with the WASD keys."
5,First I booked the gk300 but then I came across this keyboard and after going through its looks and features I immediately canceled my gk300 and I booked this keyboard. This keyboard is my first mechanical keyboard but trust me it is bestest keyboard comapred to other cosmicbyte and reddragon keyboards. The lighting effects are awesome and the switches are OP. I would definitely recommend this keyboard
4,I like the feedback and the sound is also quite nice. The only thing I felt was that the keys are a bit too small but that could be because of my huge hands or maybe because I'm used to type on my laptop. Overall it's a good buy under 1600 if you're looking for a mechanical keyboard.
4,"It's best mechanical keyboard under 1500, but spacebar has some issues while gaming space par does feel little hard to press cause it's on metal strip to support space bar but it isn't good enough."
4,"Awesome product. Feel is good. We can change the lighting options. Even though its not rgb, it looks pretty great.Keys are a bit woggly but type feel is fine. I say this the best keyboard considering the price and functionality. Unless you you got no issue spending like 4k for a keyboard, go for it.!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED. Just after 2 months started double key press issue. Sometime key press even dont work. Not expected from HP.  0 stars.BUY any cheap dell or Logitech key board but don't go for this
4,This is a good mechanical colorful back-lit keyboard. I use it for designing. It works well if you are ok with the loud click sounds. I have the GK 320 model as well which does the same job and is cheaper in price.
5,"If you want a low budget mechancial gaming keyboard, I would really recommend this keyboard. The performance in this is so outstanding that it feels like a 13,000 rs ( 100$) keyboard... Playing a game like fortnite, this keyboard is very responsive and satisfying to use..."
5,This keyboard is a mechanical keyboard with real blue switches. Not cherry mx blue but still the sound is really satisfying. It's a steal for ₹1400. It has no issues whatsoever. It has a lot of rgb settings.
1,don't buy it very cheap & local item he send used item but its totally cheap item
5,"I bought this product for 2k and honestly, I didn't expect it to be so good. I expected the keyboard to be broken and in shreds. But to my surprise, it was in perfect condition. If you are even considering buying this keyboard, I would suggest that u go for it. 😀"
4,A good mechanical keyboard. Just that the keycaps are but hollow hence the sound isn't as pleasing
4,I am using it for coding. I literally loved it. The only things I found missing in this is setting brightness level of backlit. That's it otherwise It is very good.
5,Got it for 1.3k this is a really good deal it looks and feels really high quality in real  life the rgb is really bright  there is no keybaord in thus budget thats this good dont buy if price  is 2k
5,Love the sound of keyboard and is full rgb effects really worth it product much brighter in dark a good gaming experience and a programming experience with this product.HP product is awesome
5,ITS NICE . WHAT I AM SEARCHING FOR I GET THAT IN JUST UNDER RS 2000 . WHAT A PREMIUM LOOK AND FEELING . VERY NICE PRODUCT .
5,Blue MX switches. Easy to activate. I am struggling with misclicks a lot.
3,Nice product but some times key didnt work properly
5,"I brought it at 1599 and this product is really good at this price.You can go with it ,whether it's for coding , gaming or normal typing."

5,Super and amazing product quantity is also superb
1,Received damaged product
4,"I like the fact that it fits and looks as the original. The keyboard switches are slightly different from the original (tactility) but that is to be expected. The backside of the keyboard metal plate had holes in them as compared the original (not sure why) but a simple masking tape mod, fixes the issue of dust getting in or if any liquid spills. The ribbon connector is solid and slightly longer than original that makes it easier to insert. Overall a great product!!"
5,Working as orignal keyboard
5,Light weight and perfect fit
5,nice accer keyboard
5,Nice product
4,"Bought this Combo for ₹ 509 (product + delivery) on July 20, 2018The Product is same as it is shown in the picture.Pros :1. Colour Combination looks stunning.2. Keys are Soft and doesn't make awkward sound click sounds.3. Mouse works fine and the response is also good.4. The Additional Keys on the Left and Right hand side of the Keyboard enhances the look of the Keyboard and adds shortcuts to Useful Tools.5. The Keyboard is some what Water Resistant like it can handle water splashes and drain out water from tiny holes (present on the back side of the keyboard).Cons :1. The Wire Quality is not that Good, a Flat Cable look which is not that of a great quality as Dell, HP or Logitech provides.2. The Mrp is ₹ 619 and this Product even sell at a price between ₹ 645 - ₹ 950 which is totally not worth it.Conclusion :OVERALL A NICE FUNKY LOOK keyboard + mouse COMBO AT A DECENT PRICE RANGE (₹ 450 - ₹ 550)"
3,"Well it's actually a good combo for the price rate of 500.  But the mouse is not durable , on the first hour of use , the left mouse button stuck after double clicking ...,The keyboard on other hand is much better , the buttons are soft and silent , quality of keyboard is decent .....I m not going to order replacement (becoz of mouse problem ) ... As Amazon takes 1-2 months for exchanging this one with a new one , also there's a great chance that next time I will recieve a much worse product ...(from 2 times experience before ).... Also there was no packaging , the delivery boy just hand me the original box of this, no wrapping and Amazon packaging ...?"
5,Very Good quality product .
1,"After 6 months of useageProduct was packed well by amazon and it was delivered on time.Key board keys r smooth and noiseless. Mouse responsiveness is to the markAfter 3 months of useage, the key board is not working properly. When I contacted Amazon customer service, they asked me to contact the brand and provided me with a number. The number is invalid and when I called Amazon back they told me to ""Google"" the brand's customer care number and talk to them. It's good for 3 month useage. If you are ok with it please go ahead and buy it.It's better you buy some other product from a decent brand don't go for this one.Amazon service is worst in this regard."
5,"Keyboard-I don't know about gaming but this is worth every penny. I was hesitant about its shape at first because it looked too over the top to me but I like it now. It's light weight and silent. It doesn't make the 'tk tk tk' sound when you type.Mouse -The mouse is good and nothing fancy, which is great. I hate fancy mice so this works for me. It makes a little sound when you click but it doesn't bother me much.Installation speed -I tried the keyboard and mouse on both a slow and a fast laptop to check the installation time taken by the products. If you have a laptop in a decent working condition, it would start working immediately after it is connected. But for slow laptops, you might have to wait for a minute or two. But I feel that's because of the laptop and not otherwise.Registration -It comes with one year warranty so you can register your product on their website and manage everything online. I loved that."
1,"Very poor quality. the USB connector was loose and the computer would keep telling me 'no keyboard detected'. The keys are hard are NOT ALL ALL smooth for typing. Within a few hours of use the keys started to stick and the keyboard froze, becoming completely unusable. My mistake was throwing away the packaging so i am stuck with this completely useless product without any option to exchange it."
2,"I should say this keyboard probably is worth the price with the mouse combo. However this doesn't feel good on fingers. It is spongy, bouncy type feedback typical that you would get on budget membrane keyboard. You will get used to it. One problem is that small inverted Enter key is so awkward. I dont know why at all they do it. You will hit enter key when you didn't want to.EDIT:As of December 2019 (just short of an year), I'm buying a new set paying a little bit more, maybe Logitech. Reason is that the mouse scroll wheel has 'worn out'. It's wheel don't even engage the encoder (it's been a while since it's this way - so it didn't literally last a whole year), I opened up the mouse and saw how flimsy the whole thing is put together."
4,Not highly recommend for gaming but for office work it good choice & value for money. The keyboard have multimedia shortcut keys
1,"Edit:Reduced the rating to 1 star due to following reason:Worked for about 12-13 days. And just as the return window expired, the product started developing problems. Some keys on keyboard appeared to be stuck for example character ""c"", ""m"", return key and few more just did not respond. After unplugging and plugging again, found that keys are working but now these keys were working over time. Feather touch these problem keys and the key strokes resulted in ""ccccc"", ""mmmmm"" etc. Tried multiple USB ports, re-installing driver, changing the keyboard ""repetition"" settings but in vain. Now I can't return the product also since the window has expired.The mouse still works but I don't trust the quality of it."
5,"I have now been using the combo set for close to a month. Initially, I opted for it because I found it cheap compared to the combo sets I have acquired and just did not want to spend much. I didn't expect the set to last long. But I have been extremely pleased to find that the set works better, and in some cases, much better, than the three or four Logitech sets accumulated by me which have this or that component not working properly. The keys of the keyboard are different in style to the Dell keyboard I have but equally good to use. The Dell is softer but much more expensive. I have kept a record of the Amkette set for future ref should I need to buy a set again. Great value for money."
4,"While the look and the extra shortcut keys at both end are great features but when I use it for typing by keeping the keyboard on lap, it shakes a lot and looses balance.The keys are big and you need to press them deep. Another issue is with the noise of keys while typing. The keys makes noise even you shake it tilt the keyboard slightly.The wire used in both mouse and keyboard is not rounded and smooth. In fact it is neither flat too. Hence it feels pretty itchy when rubbed over your skin.Good point is it is cheap and light weight.Using it since 1 month and so far no issues .The Rupees symbol drivers are not found, hence as of now that feature is useless"
5,"The build quality is good. For normal works,  it is just excellent.... For those who usually do rough typing or faster typing,  I would suggest them to go for Dell and Hp keyboard because I have personally used them and still using it. The delivery was fast. The combo is just fabulous at this price range... With budget between 500-700, u can just go for it. It a value for money product.."
4,"If you want a budget combo, you can definitely go for this one.Pros:* Cheaper price* Keyboard has as multi-media keys* Cool orange colour for arroys, WASD and media keys in keyboard.* Keyboard is compact and has a good feel for typing and amateur gaming experience.* Mouse is accurate and very responsive, you may feel a little bit slow in FPS games due to it's little bit low DPI.Cons:* The markings on the keycap erases after 3-4 months usage on heavy use, else I would have given 5 stars."
1,"I didn't play any games on it for 6 months after I purchased it. Infact I barely used my PC for those 6 months. As soon as I started playing PC games under 15 days the buttons wore off and stopped functioning properly.If you just want a cheap keyboard of light work, then it might hold up for a year or so. But definitely not recommended for gaming."
1,Update : Don't  buy it..Key stopped working in the 10th day of use.I have Bought this keyboard Just today.  Shall surely share an updated Review After 1 month of use.But Right now.I would like to tell you my Observation.Pro:1. Budget Friendly combo between 500 to 600 Rs.2. Nice Poppy Color looks great to eyes.3. Soft Keys make less noise when you use them.4. Finishing is Descent for the priceCons :1. The Text on the Button looks printed and Not very Attractive and Clear. Hope it doesn't come out.2. The key travel is too long.  If you dont like keyboard with long Key travel you may not enjoy the typing experience.To summarize it a good Keyboard for a Small Budget.
4,"---I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017)Its been 1 and a half years now I'm using this product.Honestly, it is not a gaming mouse and keyboard combo...its the same as normal Mouse&Keyboard. the keyboard might give you a feel likewise but not the mouseFeatures:>Worth it under 500rs (I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017))>Good build quality of keyboard and about the mouse you cant use it roughly.>my Keyboard isn't working anymore from last month. stops working automatically (Nov19).>mouse still working good.why should buy>at this price surely this is a good choice.why should not buy>If you want a real gaming keyboard and mouseUpdate: 18Nov2019 keyboard is not working suddenly, no kind of damage happens"
2,"Hello,I got keyboard and mouse combo, and felt its good, but when i connected mouse what i found was its not functioning well and it stops in between.  Seriously felt bad to purchased it from online as if it would have been from shop, i would have immediately got replacement for it, but I got stuck here, can you please replace the mouse for me please.RegardsNimesh."
5,"Keys are smooth,Design is fantastic.One extra star for all over the look.This keyboard is even better than Dell .Mouse is not that great but it is accpetable in its price & i think it is great deal in the price.NO issue at all after few months if usage."
5,I have ordered it for my son ..Excellent product ..laptop keyboard will make kids to see screen from short distance thus i ordered it.. It is really awesome.. you have one year warrenty hassle free you ca register it from amkette.com.It may not be suitable for gaming No RGB . But looks premium.Over all Thanks to amazon for recommending this order.. Amazon always ahead..
3,"Keyboard looks decent, about 3 months of usage works fine.It is not a gaming keyboard, so NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.The shortcut orange keys are made of rubber and good to navigate quickly.Can be used for laptop's extra keyboard or a secondary keyboard.Mouse looks decent as well wire quality is normal and sufficient length.Again NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.OVERALL its Average and can be used as a secondary Keyboard and Mouse"
4,"At this price its not a bad deal.  The keyboard is really good. Keys are responsive and quiet. The shortcut keys on left and right are a nice touch. They work without any additional driver s/w being needed but if you are touch typist they might put you off a bit....the alignment of the hands are slightly altered due to the left side keys.  the mouse is slightly small. the wheel is badly placed. if you use the mouse wheel a lot to scroll through web sited you will get wrist pain soon. to summarize the keyboard is good. the mouse, while not bad is slightly smaller and the scroll wheel placement is a pain"
5,"1.Decent product to buy within budget!!!2.Good for gaming3.Give feel of type writer but key strokes are on softer side while typingBeing an IT professional, computer related gadgets has to be best of use .It's of every day use for me and works really good"
5,"And the Amkette legacy continues. I love this product. Amazingly superb. Even the USB connector, the wires, the keys and the look... You won't believe, till you use it. Please see the photos of every parts, I have shared here. Thank you Amazon for another Amazing product from Amkette."
4,The keys have a nice long travel and feels sturdy. Have been using for 03 months now and completely satisfied with the product. The highlights on the keyboard look good. Quick access keys on the sides of the keyboard are a good addition to the keyboard. Overall the best budget keyboard and mouse combo available out there. Would recommend buying it.
4,"On a whole, for this price range the product was really good for office use and for gaming also it was some what better with no noise of typing and sturdy keyboard.The mouse was quite responsive with decent look.Only defect is the packaging it didnt came with the amazon packing, just a box like it came as you can see in the last picture, it was somewhat damaged outside the box so i was scared about the product but it was all fine inside as u can see the pics posted.Overall this product was good in this price range."
4,I happen to use this for my regular use and not for gaming. The keys are soft and the benefit is the multiple short cut keys that are available on the keyboard which are really working.I can not vouch for the gaming though.
4,"Perfect combo for the price. Initially I was skeptical while buying this for the quality as most of the combo available for this price are of worst quality and don't last more than 3-4 months. After using I find this to be perfect for regular/office use. If you are looking for a office keyboard/mouse combo this should be the one you can depend upon.PS: For Amazon, this is not for gaming and being a USB combo I don't think you should look for battery life."
4,"First of all I already own an Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard and I have been using it for a year without any issues, so I knew my new purchase also would not disappoint me. I bought new Amkette keyboard mouse combo for Rs 427 at Amazon Grand Shopping Festival for my sister and she already loves it. The only con with this keyboard is it cannot be used for gaming, as still the UV coated keys fade away if you use for gaming."
5,So simple...but I think it's not a feather touch......When I received this package the box of the product I teared I think it happens at the time of packaging but product is perfect no complaintsAnd this combo pack is value for moneyAfter delivered this package I know about amkette's other combo pack valued of RS599/- it is more beautiful with blue colours and it's shortcut keys are on the above........Overall rating is very good
4,"Initially i got a faulty keyboard with the ""Enter"" key getting pressed with a feather touch which made typing impossible. Then got it replaced the next day.Post that everything has been fine with the keyboard.Mouse also works great.Good product."
1,"Horrible product, hardly 2 weeks I used and the escape and space buttons are inactive. Tried reinstalling the drivers, fixed sticky keys also.. guess the product is only not good"
5,"Well packed and awesome multimedia key u can acess calculator , my computer and mute with just simple touch.Nice key operation Thanks to Amezoe and Seller for great product with more than excellent packing for product safety. Go for it blindly"
1,"Don't buy this product .It's made in china, Also it feels cheap plastic used .uncomfortable for typing .should have priced 200 inr"
1,It's not even an year and the number keys which are above alphabets stopped working. I have barely used the keyboard. I haven't used it more than 20 times in a year. It's not possible for me to go to a nearby city in this period of covid to claim the warranty.
5,I was recently looking for a keyboard and after looking at few I found this one this product had the most  excellent design I had ever seen so I ordered it. After a few months of using it I can assure you this is the most ergonomic keyboard with clicks which are Satisfactory compared to a gaming keyboard I would recommend people who can't buy expensive keyboard to look for this.
5,"Nice designed keyboard with colorful buttons of Volume control and play control, left-right directions buttons and the keys are not making much noise.  I love the keyboard.  Also, the mouse is just as good as the keyboard."
4,"it is a good quality keyboard. The good thing is that keys do not make noise while typing.This keyboard has adequate space between the keys and the peripherals have some important keys like email, audio keys and more.Overall a good quality keyboard and mouse combination, look-wise also it is nice , easy to use."
1,The numpad on the right side of this keyboard is not working.  Not sure if any special keys to be used before I use the numpad. Tried options but nothing much on internet.My bad luck is that I haven't checked it till after one month of delivery date.
1,"After a month, the keys started malfunctioning. If you are typing something, sometimes the app gets closed, sometimes Google Chrome opens up, sometime mail box opens up. My son had to leave his class as when he was doing live worksheets, some random key while typing changed the current address (online class) to the home address (Google search). Don't go with the looks, it's the worst keyboard I have ever seen. Never seen such issues even when there was windows 95."
1,In my last post I mentioned about the keyboard not working. Now when I try to contact customer support- the number is not in service. Tried multiple other numbers but nothing works. How to get the warranty for the product when they is no support from the product company.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"You can customize individual key color, You can adjust the brightness and various back light modes, Overall this is a best keyboard, this TKL keyboard saves lot of work space, You can have more near space for mouse.I personally recommend this keyboard, instead of investing more on Gateron or MX Cherry keys...!These are Outemu blue keys, they are very nice and soft and colicky.This keyboard works with Linux OS, Windows, Mac.All the best."
2,"With the budget category segmented with so many category. The Redragon K552 Kumara is a good value for money. However, they could improve the quality of the switches and offer different variants of the Switch (e.g Gateron, Kailh etc....) Even when if the price might be higher than the already offering switch.  And lastly the various hot swap switches offered by the brand is way toO TIGHT, like seriously the switches themselves get damaged when trying to take them out. Personally, many of the switch taken out for lubing got damaged."
5,"Ok so I finally got the keyboard on 5th Oct 2021, delivery was quick, packaging was great, and the keyboard... best in the segment and price range. So why the low rating? Well the ESC and F1 buttons are not working, even after replacing them with the extra switches provided. I came to know that the PCB of the keys itself is not working. I've ordered a replacement for this, when it arrives, I'll test the keyboard and if everything is working fine, I'll give it a full 5 star. Hope Origin Marketing and Apario Retail stores sees this and provide me with a proper replacement.Edit:- So I got the replacement on 13th Oct 2021 and fortunately each and every key is working perfectly. Buy this keyboard if you want full RGB with mechanical switches at a reasonable price. Thank you.... :)"
5,"After research, bought my 1st mechanical keyboard. I was worried about the noise levels of blue switches but the typing experience is next level. I think it's little overpriced, but it's VFM if compared to Corsair, Razor etc. They are too expensive for what they're offering. This is tenkeyless design which is better for most of the people as only few people needs numpad. It's definitely recommended."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,"The TKL layout is great for space conservation and the RGB is very good not the best but it has 18 different modes so atleast you can find the one you like. The keys are outemu blue switches, they are very clicky in my opinion even more than chery mx blue and louder also but if you like clicky mechanical keyboards or are new to experiencing them then this is a great start, I personally prefer brown switches. Overall build quality is solid it has a metal plate underneath the keys and the surrounding is of plastic and key stabilizers are decent. I bought them as a present for my younger brother at 3799rs."
5,"The keyboard is really amazing in looks and build quality. Weight is perfect for it's compact TKL size. RGB is beautiful, a lot of presets to choose from. A bit loud clicky sound as expected from blue switches. Overall it's great!"

5,"I don't want to write an Essay here about this Monster.All I can tell you is ""Just buy this monster"" if you are a typing person.Note: I am using this Keyboard for a month."
1,My product stop working after some days and the company not providing a warranty.
5,"got it for 3.7k ,amazing build quality , has full rgb support,nice brightness levels , the blue switches sound amazing"
5,Great product. What you see is what you get. Good value for money.
5,was as expected and price could have been lower i got it at 3800.
5,Clicks sound ! 🔥🔥🔥Light modes amazing ! 🔥
1,"The item was supposed to be gift for my son. The condition of the keyboard and the packaging was really bad. The item was old, dirty and used. Quite disappointed. Especially, for my son."
5,"The Keyboard is tanky and we'll build. Pretty close to what you see in the photos. I liked the key presses. The packaging was bad though, it was without any protection."
5,A very sturdy and durable build. Gives a very premium feel for a significantly low price. It feels a lot better and appealing in person than in pictures and videos.
5,This is awesome. I like typing on mechanical keyboard and bought it for office work.
5,"49 RS was a bit high, considering that it's just a sheet but it works for me."
2,It turned out to be faulty as many letter buttons are not functioning.Therefore I request you to either replace with a  good item or return my money.Early response to this is greatly appreciated
4,"This is one of the best combo of keyboard and mouse. I am using it over a long time and have no issues.Pros-1. long and strong wires which have tough insulation.2. hard USB plug don't become loose soon.3. standard size and easy to clean4. mostly keyboard has problem that wire become loose and get damage from where it comes out from keyboard, but not in with this.5. mouse is very fine quality left-right clicks are very responsive even after one year of heavy use.6. best for desktop usecons.1. because of wired not useful for laptops which have only 2-3 USB ports even long wires make it mess.2. dust attractive plastic3. not for heavy gaming"
5,"- Both K&M are great. The typing experience on the keyboard is great. My hand tends towards larger size still the mouse fits perfectly under the palm with comfortable grip. The best thing about wired K/M is that they never glitch/lag and you don't have to worry about battery draining quickly.- I primarily use it for coding and other light office work and for light gaming.- The extra function keys at the top of the keyboard provide convenient way of playback controls which laptops provide with an extra ""Fn"" key, settings of which can be quite irritating.Overall, pretty happy with the quality of Logitech. The price point of 1099 seems just about right as well."
5,"Extremely delightful keyboard.I might be biased towards Logitech, then again there is a reason for it.For many years, Logitech has been consistently providing me with quality products and never left anything missing for complaint.Keyboard, mouse and other such personal interaction devices are matter of personal choice. Someone the ergonomics and product usability of Logitech is extremely suitable for me.Wonderful product and I would suggest / recommend this to anyone who wishes to have something worthwhile, longer lasting a fair price."
2,"I majorly ordered this because of the keyboard. The keyboard is made up of very low-quality plastic. Not a good typing experience if you are planning for long hours of typing on this. For playing games, it will require more pressure on typing then the regular ones. It registers keystroke slow as compared to its competitors.Mouse if okay. Not so great and not so bad. Its an average. It gets the work done."
4,Got on time. Typing from the same keyboard. Its good one. Keys are smooth and not getting stuck. Just feel that menu button beside right control key is a slightly bigger which sometimes presses while typing. Rest everything is fine....bought it at Rs.907 with mouse so for me value for money at this price. Go for it.
5,Got m100 b100r etc. Mouse before none worked for gaming purpose the mouse that comes with this combo works always like a charm for gaming but you have to buy this combo as mouse is not available seperately go for it have been using it for 4 years to play battlefield 3
3,The only problem in this otherwise good keyboard is that the USB receiver is too large. It does not fit into the mouse and is separate so has to be taken care of since it can get lost. All wireless mouses now have a small usb receiver that fits in the back next to the batteries. This is not designed well.
5,"I am in fact typing this with the same keyboard. It is a great combo, I must say. The mouse is sharp and has a nice design. I already had this product a few years ago. It has been in the market for a few years. But it is still purchased a lot. I would really recommend it to anyone. I am a student who has to type things a lot. It really is a comfort for me to type now. It really has a FEATHER TOUCH"
5,"Ordered on 08 aug 2021 Logetech MK 200, found keyboard calculator key not working; amazon promptly replaced on 10 aug 2021, now working all keys nicely. Amazon – is prompt in sending replacement next day;  Logitech MK 200 wired keyboard is best – because of the multimedia 8 keys all placed on top most with direct operation without the need of FN key."
2,"The keyboard was okay when I bought back in 2016 and after a year the keyboard keys are not working properly, it is like having dust in your food while eating. Frustration starts from second year but some how managed to use it for 4 years. Previously had internet pro keyboard and it works still great with my old PC from 2004. This product is waste of money and you will get frustrated as time passes. Mouse is okay till now."
4,"So far both have been working smoothly and it's been a few months since it was purchased. I originally had an old TVS keyboard and nothing comes even close to it in terms of durability. But the keys in this keyboard don't make that annoying clicking sound while typing, so all's fine."
1,"Delivered on 17 jul. started using on 19th. Return time lapsed 23rd. A lot of keys went non functional without any kind of damage 28th jul. now I have to courier it to wic of Logitech. I don’t know how much time will it take to receive a fresh kit. But I have to wait now, my work will be obstructed. Update I received it back on 2nd Sep 2021. Btw I bought other combo from local market as I was unsure about the time taken by Logitech to replace it."
5,My favourite keyboard mouse combo. I have bought this set three times. All working super till date. The oldest one is ten years old and still you can play Project IGI and Max Payne. If you want to break them deliberately then only a chance of damage. Fantastic ergonomics and works on any OS platforms smoothly.
5,Keyboard and Mouse working as expected. INR sign added on Keyboard is good feature. I'm using Logitek keyboard for last 10 years and I can say this keyboard is heavily improved.Mouse is little heavy as compared to Wireless Mouse which I'm using for last couple of years.Go for it without any hesitation.
2,"It turned out to be faulty as many letter buttons are not functioning like d, k, shift+).Therefore I request you to either replace with a good item or return my money.Early response to this is greatly appreciated. This was purchased on 3rd July 2020. It's not expected from Amazon. Please do your needful unless we will lost faith to order on Amazon."
4,"I am a programmer and I am using this combo for 1 month now, initially I faced difficulties typing faster but after 1 week or so I got used to it and now I am much faster. Although I prefer mechanical but this will also do your job. It's not very sound making keyboard. The other functions keys are really helpful like mute, volume up etc. Mouse is a bit big and little heavy but I am ok with it, intact I like it very much."
5,"The keyboard is nice, has a good feel and just the right tactical feedback (and click sound). It is a simple keyboard so not much to write/review, just looks fine and works fine. Was plug-and-play with a Windows 10 system and no complaints. I was using a nearly identical (wireless, this is cord) keyboard so feels right as it was before. Good product, nothing fancy, I recommend it."
5,"The product is excellent. I am fully satisfied with the product. In key board, almost no sound on typing and mouse is good."
5,"Both the keyboard and mouse received in well packed condition.  The keyboard is however troublesome.  Right now letter ""S""  is not very easy to use.  I feel cheated.  As business ethics demand Amazon please get me replacement."
4,"Good for productive work, gamers please stay away.. but its also not that bad for gaming but not that good too.. its sleek,light weight and those multifunctional keys come very handy. The mouse came with it is also good fits properly in the hand Also I have notice the red light on the grey part of the mouse coming from side to back its not that noticeable you have to look but close activates once you move the mouse same time as the sensor lights up"
1,"The keys have become very hard to use in just 2 months of using.  There is no dirt on the keyboard, so it looks like a design problem.Half the times the letters don't appear on the screen because the key is hard to press.  It was fine when it arrived."
5,Video Player is loading.
5,Earlier was use a wireless keys and mouse however due to lockdown the batteries kept running out very fast so decided to have a wired keyboard and mouse.Keyboard and mouse quality is really good
5,"Great keyboard and mouse combination from Logitech! The keys are soft to press and the response is good. Both are plug'n'play and get detected easily. Suitable for general computer use, coding and casual gaming. Not suitable for games which require multiple key press combinations."
5,"Bought it for Rs 770/-  to replace my beaten down HP keyboard and half working Dragon War Leviathon mouse.Keyboard is simply awesome while the mouse isn't too bad.Pros :1. Play,Pause,Volume UP,DOWN and MUTE keys are given in the keyboard for easy access2. calculator option is the most useful for me3. Keys are soft to pressCons :1. Keyboard surface is rough and attracts dust."
5,"Nice keyboard and mouse combo. The main advantage of this keyboard is its having multimedia keys like play pause, mute, volume up and down which are very handy. The keys are pretty good for fast typing."
1,"I have bought two k200 keyboard, both have same problem. When A and S keys are pressed together L key is not working and same things about W,D and J key. Are keyboards are well tested? Or rejected items are being sold by the seller?"
4,"This is probably the best combination available at this price. It's really cheap and it gets the job done.The keyboard isn't quite good enough if you type really fast (like me), but you can't expect it at this price range.The mouse works for about 18 months before it's likely to fail - under regular usage.I'd recommend it for anyone with a budget under Rs. 1000."
1,"Within 3 months of purchase the keys are not working trying to toggle between program shuts down the entire system.  If pressed some keys double entry happens.  I've used Logitech keyboard earlier and was very amazed at its performance, but really disappointed with this one"
5,"Both the products work smoothly. Keypads are easily pressable & well separated. This combination is worth buying in this price range. No harm in buying, value for money."
1,"I have noticed many times that randomly keys stop working. I had purchased two keyboards during lockdown, logitech and hp. HP price is even less, but it is working fine. I would not recommend logitech based on my experience. Right now, even after multiple restart of my computer, same keys are not working. One rating is given because, even if some keys are not working, keyboard is of no use."
5,"There are gaming series like Steel, there are ergonomic ones but the best of both worlds for just the apt price is Logitech.It's actually Logical to buy tech of this brand"
5,"It's not the best one. But it's performance at such an aggressive price definitely makes it best in this range. I've been using this keyboard since a year and all the keys are functioning perfectly. Although with extensive usage few keys like ENTER on which we really hit hard, has become bit lose but that doesn't affect the working at all."
1,Hardly a month since purchase and buttons do not work properly. I have to punch it like Mike Tyson first a few times and it suddenly starts working. Better to avoid.
5,"Keys are very soft and quality material, design is very slim and good, keys are working like charm and like key shortcuts for mail, music and etc.,"
5,I was Facing latency issue with Bluetooth keyboard and mouse so I bought this and I am totally happy with its quality with respect to price
5,"Been using it for 7 months now. I do programming and type whole day. I think for the price, it is really very good combo. I will buy it again if I need to."
5,Using this model for many yearsNow I ordered same for AmazonThis keyboard and mouse are very good quality and have comfortable to uesFor heavy work load
4,"I have used couple of Y-SZ49 model in the past and they are undoubtedly great. This one seems a bit downgraded version but not in terms of quality, only in terms of overall shape, design and size. It is little bit smaller then the old model but that does not create any problem as such.At the end of the day, A true Logitech Quality product."
4,"Quality is okay, but I think they are a bit expensive.  In this price, they should at least double the quantity, like 20 switches."
4,"I am a gamer and chose to buy the Outemu Reds to mod my keyboard. I bought 10 of them and switched my WASD, Space-bar, Esc, Enter and Backspace along with some other keys. Reds are naturally good for gaming because of their non tactile nature and suitable actuation force. And this is exactly what these Outemu switches deliver. These are excellent substitutes to Cherry MXs. But for just 10 switches a price of ₹600? These are great switches but are way overpriced. I like these switches and would have labelled them a perfect buy if not for the big price."
4,"Buy this only if the keys on your keyboard are hot swappable and don't make the mistake that I did.The keys that I got seem fine, but seem quite expensive for just 10 keys.Hopefully, I make use of this in the future."
2,"The keys have kind of inconsistent feed back. Some keys offer lighter click feel than others.For the asking price, it's not worth."
5,but costly. should have provided 20-30pcs
1,It destroyed my keyboard and I had to bear a loss
4,It's value for money
1,"Please double the pieces and people might actually buy it, we done these switches just for 10 key it has to be at-least 25 to 30"
1,"Check out websites like GenesisPC, Meckeys, StacksKB, Rectangles Store, etc. You will see better brand switches being sold for half the price of this one. The only reason people buy these overpriced Outemu switches is because they bought a cheap Redragon keyboard and thought buying these switches is cheaper than buying a new keyboard. Lets do some math shall we? 10 outemu switches cost Rs.679. For the Kumara K552, you'll need Rs.6000+ to buy a full set of switches for the keyboard. That's twice the price of the keyboard itself. For that price, you could buy the GK64 or Keychron K2 which are much better quality keyboards. It is crazy just how much they're charging for these switches."
3,"Outemus are standard 3 pin switches you'll find in most budget keyboards. So if you liked the switches that came with your keyboard, you'll like them.However, these are grossly overpriced. These cost roughly ₹69 per key but for that price, you'll get the best mechanical switches from Durock, Kailh, Gateron, even Glorious. Outemus should cost around ₹15/key so before you buy these take a look at the available alternatives.Look at StackKB, Meckeys, GenesisPC, Rectanges Store for more choices at better prices."
3,"Great clicky switches (Blues) with a uniform feel between all of them. Using for a musical rhythm sequencer without keycaps so can't say how they'll feel with them, but on the naked shaft, they feel good.This listing is really overpriced, really should be either half to a third of the price or twice to thrice as many switches."
1,"Worthy review posted earlier by a user on the same problem dated 10th Oct. 2019.Never expected such  a sub-standard quality for a High-end Logitech mouse. Cheap and old outdated mouse are still working good even after many years of use.  At 2.8K, I felt a strong urge to upgrade and eventually brought it 1.5 yrs back. NO other option to regret it for the money wasted on it..Left click button got damaged in just over a year of normal usage. At the beginning I ignored the problem and by the time I appreciated it as a performance failure warranty had already lapsed.Had it been a cheap mouse, I'd have junk it than going to service centre for a button replacement. I was even agreed to pay the replacement cost as well.Horrible experience  in locating and visiting the nearby logitech service centre. It just waste of time to go there.Please mind it carefully, There is no support or even paid replacement of spare parts after warranty expires.Think multiple times before order that you have a genuine reasons to buy it."
5,"This is the best mouse logitech has to offer. The MX Master 2S and MX anywhere 2S need recharging every few weeks and they both cost above 6,000 rupees. With the Logitech options application you can map 7 functions that can vary for EVERY single application that you run. These mappings can be to a key combination, a file, a folder, a webpage. common settings of your OS and much more.Features:• 2 years battery life• Tilt wheel for horizontal scrolling (very useful for spreadsheets or other tasks that need a lot of horizontal scrolling)• Hyper Fast scrolling and regular scrolling toggle (for long documents/web pages or if you ever get stuck in a wall in Sketchup)• Two side buttons (Example: Forward and Back in Windows Explorer, Crouch and Prone in Call of Duty)• Gesture button (Example: Increase/Decrease Volume, Next/Previous Track, Play/ Pause Playback with one quick gesture)• Device switching button (Ability to quickly switch between three devices)• Ergonomic comfort (Medium sized mouse for long working sessions)Logitech Flow which is an entire game changer if you are working on multiple systems• You can move your mouse to the edge of your screen and you will immediately start controlling the second device (this behavior can be changed if its not acceptable)• You can copy files between two or three computers through the mouse! No pen drive needed or mailing files to yourself.Try to buy it during the LIGHTNING DEAL for around 2,800 bucks. It's really worth it."
1,"After using MX11 Anywhere for 7 years. I decided to transition to this mouse for my 3D graphic work and simulation. This is absolutely HORRIBLE. The latency is just not something you would expect for this price range. The dedicated middle mouse button has been replaced with scroll hyper/incremental option which makes no sense, the MX11 option to click the scroll wheel itself was brilliant. The side buttons are highly in ergonomic they continue to be accidentally pressed even after weeks of use, so there's no getting used to it. The Bluetooth pairing of the mouse increases the lag and latency even more.Logitech had an amazing platform on which they could have built the Marathon, instead they ignored all of it and ended up with a product which boasts mountains but delivers absolutely nothing.The feel and response of this product just screams cost cutting on all level. I have never been such disappointed by a company which I have adored for such a long time.Logitech needa better R&D with contractors that can actually replicate real world use of their products, focus more on real life applications and consult with their customers before releasing a product that takes the worse traits of their product line and combine it in a single product.After paying this much for a mouse which i expected to replace the MX11 with, I find myself finding online hacks to resolve the minor issues with my MX11 and cut my losses with the Marathon. This is not a mouse, it is a toy and it goes in my 1 year old son's toy bin."
1,"The mouse seems to have many promising features, like dual connectivity, unifying feature and even a gesture control area on the side. But based on practicality and the quality I believe that the mouse is extremely poor quality. The primary click buttons start to give problems after minimal usage. Either the click mechanism is faulty in this model or there is some other production issue. Overall among Anker, HP and even other Logitech mice that I have used, this happens to be of the worst quality. Unexpected of Logitech......But it is true."
2,"It was good for half an hour, connected to both devices.Unfortunately after that, it started malfunctioning.  The item I received was constantly disconnecting and reconnecting with connected devices. Tried everything on internet Logitech forums to fix the problem (item was 2 yrs old according to sticker on package) - no result. At last I was left with no other option at all but to return it. Amazon return/refund was swift. Kudos. I hope the level of customer service stays this way, Amazon."
5,"Very good mouse. After using it for almost 2 weeks now I am still fascinated by its performance and design.Pros:Very ergonomic designCan be used for hoursgood for gamingcan be used on 3 devices at once - also compatible with androidthere is a button in the middle which changes the weal to smooth scrolling for those long long web pages - it realy helpsa secret button in left side bottomconfigurable buttonstiltable wheal buttonswhat else do you want!!!!!!!!!!!!.................Cons:I faced only 1 problem. Although the configuration of this mouse is very easy, but there is no proper instruction manual. So, I had to fiddle around and it took me 1 hour to just connect 1st laptop via bluetooth. And, it took me another 1/2 hour to learn how to switch device and configure the laptop to correct button - There are 3 buttons for 3 connected devices.Now I know how to configure, so if needed it will take 2 min. only but the company should include an instruction manual that can be read by normal people."
5,"1. Works with macbook pro as well as ipadOS.2. The Logitech options software is great for mapping buttons based on applications (this does not work for ipadOS).3. The switcher is easy to use and reach as opposed to mx master series.4. Good finish, nice scroll wheel with dual mode. The scroll wheel also has three button modes (click down, click left and right)5. Almost half price of the MX master 3"
5,"Affordable mouse which has most of the features of MX master. The MX Master 3 horrizontal scroll bar is nice feature missing in this. But you will find that feature not working as expected most of the time and you want to adjust to app level, which makes it unusable.The weight of the mouse is Perfect. MX master is very heavy and bulky. The bluetooth feature helps to connect to device without the dongle. If you have multiple devices also this is great feature."
4,"Look imma be honest here,I brought this mouse almost two years ago for 4K (yeah I know little expensive but bare with me), since then I've used this mouse almost everyday. It fits my hand perfectly, doesn't lag as other reviewers have said just make sure you use it on a surface favorable to a regular mouse like a mouse pad or something. Also it has a long battery life, now to be fair my battery died but Like I said I have been using it almost every day ever since I bought it for at least 5 to 9 hours a day everyday I used it, trust me you won't need to worry.some nitty gritty.<b>  Logitech options </b>  : Logitech Options is a proprietary app for logitech products to customize any buttons except left/right click and scroll<b> Extra Buttons </b>  : Comes With 3 re-programmable buttons 2 on the edge and 1 on thumb rest the third one on edge is actually to switch between  devices.<b>  can be paired with multiple devices </b><b>  If your computer doesn't have bluetooth you can use a wireless receiver that comes with the mouse </b><b>  side scroll </b>  It's also got side scroll (also re-programmable)<b> Fast Scroll </b>  you can click the button on the top of the mouse at the middle and it changes your normal scroll to fast scroll, its so smooth  and helpfulanyways hope you'll find this video helpfulHappy BrowsingSee yah!"
1,This mouse left click stopped working properly just after a year of purchase.It started clicking twice and impossible to drag and drop.I have bought a few other Logitech mice and keyboards too. This being the most expensive and the last product I'll buy from Logitech.All their products are having issues after a few years of use.Poor quality left click is the problem i faced with all.I'm switching to brands like Lenovo/Dell.
1,"Worst mouse quality, damaged in 8 months with normal usage. was not able to claim warranty on time coz I bought razor mouse which is working perfectly and forgot to claim warranty, customer support said, you are delayed by 7 days, I told him it was not working since many months, Didn't expect this cheap quality button from logitech."
2,I have been using the mouse for 2 years and 8 months and it worked well until recently. Now the left click of the mouse is malfunctioning and not operating correctly. This product is not worth the price if its lifespan is this much. I used it almost everyday so make your judgement accordingly.
4,"Looks like logitech has decided to go good on design ... but cheap on making the products long lasting.I previously had a logitech combo, there also the mouse stopped working in 1 year, and keyboard also developed problems with certain keys.Then I bought this pricey mouse, hoping this will be better - but just in 1.5 year the left click is problematic - so much that its now difficult to work.I am thinking of not buying Logitech product anymore .Buy this mouse with the expectations of this working only for a year."
5,My old Logitech mouse M560 lasted for 7 years. This mouse is a good upgrade from my previous mouse. Very comfortable for hand. Can connect to three devices which is very handy. Bluetooth connectivity saves a USB port in the laptop. I hope it is as durable as my old mouse.
5,"If you have the money and need a reliable mouse that perfectly fits your hands and works brilliantly every time, then this is the mouse to go for.No other mouse comes closer to the performance, build, battery life, precision and comfort that this mouse offers.One of the best in class."
5,At 2.8k this mouse is amazing value for money considering all the features that you get. It's a decent sized mouse which is quite ergonomic. Supports logitech flow and the buttons are easily customizable through Logitech options. Connection is fast and easy no hassle at all. Comes with a unifying reciever as well.
3,Full of features and I thought it's a steal at about Rs 3.5K but the scroll wheel is irritating to a point your fingers and wrist start paining. It's of inferior quality and not at all stable. Better go for mx master series.
1,"After a usage of 1+ years, now both the click buttons are not working properly. Unble to drag and drop items. This is happening right after few months of  warranty expiration. It is very expensive mouse and it's reliability is so low that I have to spend on new mouse again."
5,"Price could have been cheaper but definitely a good buy. I use a palm grip and the shape is just right and the switching is seamless. It could've been lighter though. Can't comment on battery life as it's been only a month since I bought it. For anyone wondering, AA cell is included"
5,Wonderfully designed and very easy to use. Works as the perfect mate of K480.The only gripe is that no product manual was supplied. Rated a well deserved 5 stars.
1,too bulky. there other 2 devices mouse available those comes with silent click as well.this one being more expensive does not have that feature.
5,Beautiful Piece of art.! Wonderful Mouse with premium features. Very comfortable during long working hours. Perfect size and On-time Amazon Delivery.
5,"Coming from using cheap mice, I was very skeptical at first to buy this but was delighted to use it eventually. Support for multiple devices, Bluetooth as well as receiver mode and the customizable buttons make it a very good investment. Just buy it, you won't regret it."
5,"Using this with a Mac, and the side hidden button is useful when switching pages (the triple finger swipe)."
5,Got what i have wished for... This is an amazing product... Along with the K375 keyboard... I can contol my laptop desktop and mobile with the same mouse and keyboard.....can make and take calls... Working is really fun...
5,My first expression was WTF you can do all magic with this mouse. I am impressed. Great product for 2.8k in Lightning Deal.
5,Perfect for people like me who work on multiple devices at the same time.
5,Love this a lot. Also figured out a way to connect this mouse as a bluetooth device on Win7 without having to use the dongle :)
5,It is perfect in every way. It might be on a more costlier side but it is worth every ruppee.
5,Very nerdy. I don't actually use all the buttons but it's really good to know that you can use in case you need them
5,Great Little Mouse. Having Bluetooth connectivity issue in windows 10 but everything works fine with unifying receiver. Edit (May 2018): Bluetooth connectivity is good after the latest windows update. Bumped up my ratings to 5.
5,This has saved me a lot of desk space allowing me to switch between multiple computers. Well worth the money
5,Full sized ergonomic mouse. Lovely to use.
5,Very nice mouse at this price. I purchased at Rs.2700/-.
4,"Highly Ergonomic and easy to use, but costly too"
5,"Its really nice, Can connect to 3 devices, build has rubber texture helps in holding it firmly..oveall extremely nice product"
5,Great Product. Easy to use. Well designed
5,Works perfect with 3 devices and change of connection is instant. Fully demonstrate the design for multiconnect device.
5,"Had been using dual device logitech mouse for last one year. It helped be speed up my work, so moved to 3 device connectivity mouse."
5,Great product. Takes a bit of time to get used to.
1,"Bought it two days ago. Outside packaging was good but original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle was missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement."
5,"Excellent keyboard and mouse combo. Silent touch is very nice, I can't hear any sound from keyboard very quiet. I like it is water proof and has vents and holes in the bottom to drain any accidental spills. Mouse works and tracks nicely, accurate to the clicks and double clicks. One dongle only for the keyboard and mouse so no need to worry about using up 2 ports. Both mouse and keyboard has a place to plug the USB dongle while not in use so you don't fear of losing. Also both mouse and keyboard has on-off buttons so you can save battery by switching it off by your end of day."
3,"No issues with the functioning of the keyboard and mouse. They are both working well. I am satisfied with the ""silent"" feature. However, I found the keyboard keys slightly harder on the fingers than I would like. And my biggest issue is, the mouse doesn't come with rubber base. So it slips if you use it on a slanted table/desk. It's not even standing on normal mouse pads. I have to find a mouse pad that has a non-smooth antislip surface.Update after 6 months of minimal usage : Left button of the mouse stopped working. The mouse is useless now."
5,"The keyboard is excellent. As described in the product description it is very silent. I can’t hear it over my fan. That is more than good enough for me. I bought this product assuming that I can connect it to Logitech unifying receiver. I have a M720 mouse which I love to bits. I wanted to give this mouse to my wife and use just the keyboard. I realized only after unboxing that it will only work with the USB dongle it came with. I wanted to return the product, I tried using the keyboard for a day and decided the keyboard alone was worth paying the 2,500 and I kept the product. I wish the keyboard is supported by the Logitech options software. I could have changed the key binding of some of the shortcut keys given at the top.Don’t get me wrong mouse is not bad, it just too small for me. I am very used to my M720 which is almost as big as MX Master. Mouse tracking is good. But, as mentioned in some other reviews it is super light and have very little resistance on a wooden table. It just flies from one corner of the screen to another. May be with some use I can get used to the weight of this mouse. It is not a fair comparison to compare this to my M720 as that mouse alone cost almost twice as much as this combo. This mouse is supported by the Logitech options software and you can assign around 5 shortcuts to the mouse which is great to see at this price point."
1,Very poor order delivery. First time the order was received without the usb receiver. Returned and reordered. The rellace.ent came without the mouse !!
3,"After 2 days:Keyboard is not working in Mac and Ubuntu/Linux OS.I need to close to the USB receiver ( 2-5cm distance) in order to work.For this price 2395 it is not worth.Other keyboard K220 bought a year before working fine. Need a replacement.Initial Impression:This is one of the best keyboard and mouse i ever used.Typing speed is absolutly very smooth and there is no key press sound. Very little noise but it wont disturb any one who is near by.Mouse is really silky smooth and no click sound at all.only thing it has very soft keys no soundmouse is really smooth and very silent.Price wise this is little high 2395, if it is 1999 it would be best value for money.one USB nano receiver is great to handle both keyboard and mouse.I am using this keyboard for my raspberry pi 4. Since RPI4 has limitted USB ports so using this one USB receiver is really helpful."
1,5 stars for product but 2 stars for seller.Product received was not seal packed. I could make out that tapes were opened and then re-pasted. The mouse from keyboard mouse combo was not working. Keyboard was working very well.So i placed return with replacement order. I received the replacement within a day but i was scared looking at the condition of the replaced product box. It was battered with tape applied instead of original seal tape. I have uploaded photographs of the packing.Fortunately this time both mouse and keyboard are working and are working good.
3,"I received the the product in just 9 hours, delivery wise and packaging wise everything was good, the boxes were in very good condition without any damageChanging my comment on the product in just two days.  1) I feel the key press should have been little more softer  2) I did one test with this keyboard and the dell laptop keyboard in the night when it completely pin drop silence  environment.  what i observed was that the dell laptop keyboard is also not silent but the key press noise is lower  compare to the Logitech keyboard.  i tried typing few sentences with the Logitech keyboard and same sentences again with the dell laptop  keyboard.  3) if you type slow also there is noise on the key press.  4) found that only the alpha keys , numeric keys(not the numpad keys) , arrow keys,  5) space bar, tab, enter, shift, alt, ctrl key are somewhat silent compared to the alpha and numeric keys  6) Price is very high  and the usb receiver is also not unifying one at this price.  7) even the click of the mouse button is not silent as mentioned. I have Logitech M331, which is way silent than  the M220 mouse provided with the keyboard.reducing my rating of this product just because it does not meet the requirement of silent touch, also i have given the product 3 star just because it is not that bad as well if you see the other aspects of product like the plastic quality is good, you have volume control option and also I don't have any doubt on the battery life because i have already used Logitech product earlier as well and they proved to be lasting longer compared to dell mouse where i used to change the batteries twice or thrice in a month."
5,"i liked the keyboard, i have the habit working late with my kids working beside. typing my older keyboards wake up my kid and disturb his sleep. this is one is so silent soft work. very sift srispy typing feel i get. it has capslock indicator which is sufficient for as numlocks and scroll locks i hardly use.Mouse too is very silent soft. it has very high promising battery life, hop it lasts long.It has been 8 months, now i observe first signs of low battery, connectivity issues comes up. Yes alkaline batteries do last long, really long in this keyboard"
5,"Writing this review after one week of use.It is a very good quality combo set of keyboard and mouse.. Received in perfect condition. Keyboard and Mouse both are super silent (no tik-tik anymore). Full size keyboard. Medium size mouse (Model: M220-SilentTouch). Just plug the tiny receiver, switch ON the keyboard and Mouse buttons and it immediately starts working. Get rid of hassles of wiresI had also checked Logitech MK270R combo which was approx. Rs.1000 less than this but finally decided to go with this due to the factors such as Silent Touch, Longer Battery Life and Newer Model. And after using it for a week, I think it was a good decision.I recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of wiring around their PC/Laptop and looking for clean desk.Overall a very nice product and good buy."
5,"Finally the best after trying 3 different one, tired the Dell entry level combo (that was undoubted worst) then tried Logitech MK345 it works like a typewriter ( key punch sounds) , sold that on olx for half the price when I purchased this one . Not about the product . Its just AWSOME ! , the key feel and the mouse both . Keyboard is very well built and feels great . Both keyboard and mouse have rugged feel when you touch. Its great in the Work from Home environment specially if you work late night and don't want to disturb  someone with the keystrokes and mouse clicks . Not only keyboard even the mouse clicks are (almost) noise less . This is not 100% silent but no one should be able to hear and gets disturbed by the keystroke noise . if you want to quantify of noise eradication will it eradicates more than 90-95% key click noise"
4,Wow.. i am really surprised with this keyboard. This is exactly what i was looking for in a keyboard all my life. I have been searching for a keyboard where i dont get those irritated clicking noise in my mouse and keyboard both and wanted a very soft touching slient option. My search ended here. But my search was little ruined as the layout of the keyboard is not to my taste.The buttons dont have spacing between them. Even the lines between keys are not much. I want a better layout to make this as perfect choice of keyboard for life.I like big layout style keyboard for faster typing speeds along with hand rest at the bottom and multimedia keys for faster handling of medias.
1,"The moment I opened the package, I could see that it was already opened by someone and then put together half heartedly. I anyway gave it a chance and connected to my laptop. The connection was fast and there was no visible lag. However, the keys were malfunctioning a lot. Changing language automatically, some of the keys not working at times (you have to remove the receiver and plug it in again). I have raised a request for the replacement. Will update once the replacement is here."
4,"What I like:1. Excellent keyboard. Just the right weight, sturdy, does not slide away when you type, good wireless connection, smooth & silent typing, good travel of keys. Note: This keyboard makes absolutely no sound at all and if you are one who enjoys your keyboard's sound - this is not the product for you.2. The mouse is precise in its working. Clicks are silent.3. Product is well packaged. The receiver is kept in an easily accessible place in the carton box.4. There is a place to store the receiver (below the keyboard), if you wish to carry the product around.What could have been better:1. The mouse is very small for my hand. For this price, they could have given a full size mouse. The current mouse is not comfortable to use if you have medium to large hands.2. The scroll wheel of the mouse is very noisy.2. The caps-lock LED is almost useless as it is too dim to be visible during the day."
5,"The keys are silent - they don't make clicky noises. That's not to say it doesn't make sound, it does. It's just muffled and low-frequency.The keys are sturdy and seem to be of good quality for the price. I personally feel there's a bit too much resistance though. Typing casually is fine, but if you're a writer and write multiple pages per day, maybe you should consider chicklet style keys. I use this primarily for work, to compose a few emails per day, interact with others on chat, and create occasional documents, and I have been very satisfied with it. On long typing sessions, it sure gives your fingers a workout, but it's not a deal breaker."
4,"The keyboard is extremely quiet, although the typing is not that comfortable due to the key feedback being a little too hard. Maybe that will be ok after getting used to it.Separate indicator for caps lock but none for num lock. Otherwise keyboard has all the keys in the right place.Truly plug and play with both Ubuntu and Windows"
4,"This is a good product. I am writing this review after using this keyboard-mouse combo for around 1 month and I am satisfied with this product.Keyboard is about 90% silent and is easy to use; no tak-tak noise but still some sort of sound is there while typing, which is ok. Also Mouse is working good and has a good grip."
4,"I don’t think I can get used to using this silent touch, basically compared to the mechanical keyboard I have used, I think I keep getting the keys wrong always, it feels small and does not fit well. The typing experience is a bit down but it’s super silent for one and has the promised wireless. Basically I needed it for using whenever I get on bed, so it doesn’t father me much now, but as a main keyboard it lacks at a lot of places, at this price range"
4,Box was a mess(the sets box). But the product itself is very very silent. If you using mk270 then the difference will be the feel of mesh can be felt clearly. So if you dont mind little hard on gaming you can go for it else 270 or some other i guess? Only 4 stars since box is ruined.Ps: The switch sure helps out the battery.
1,The keyboard isn't working properly. There is so much lag sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Such a pathetic product with such high price. Bought it after reading reviews but all my money got wasted. Logitech being such a big and famous brand selling such kind of products. Shame!!
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Product is amazing. Very soft keys and silent as they mentioned.  Mouse is good as well but in my case i got used one so asked for replacement.
5,"Connected immediately to my macbook with no issues at all.Is very smooth, silent and seamless typing experience - I am sure it will help improve the productivity. Mouse is working quite well too.  Build quality is pretty decent and it claims to be spill-proof which I hope I don’t have to test... ;)"
4,"Very good product no doubt but there are some disadvantages in it, which should be modified I think!First of all, there's no Num Lock indicator in the keyboard.Secondly, dislike the mouse, the keyboard on/off switch don't have any color (Red/Green) indication."
5,This is one the best silent wireless keyboard & mouse.FN keys dosn`t have any secondary keys like (multimedia shortcuts) which is good thing for the ppl who uses software like autocad & 3d design software & dedicated multimedia buttons are provided on the above of FN keys.this model is very very silent & good for those who is doing WFH & so that no one gets disturbed by keyboard/mouse pressing sounds & this keyboard & mouse has on/off switch too.loved it very much.CAPSLOCK INDICATOR LIGHT PRESENT & it dosnt switches off automaticaalyBUT NUM LOCK LIGHT NOT PRESENT.
4,"It's good only for a limited use, not for programming or typing.I liked its silent touch technology. Worth it!Only the wheel of the mouse makes high noise, in fact some poor grade kind of mouse noise.Again, the Amazon delivery is the worst, no bubble wrapping, no brown paper box. One of the corners of the keyboard got broken a bit."
4,Overall product is good. I cannot comment on battery as its news so use ur judgement. The only sketchy part is the on/off slide switch they are of plastic and i don't know how long would they survive esp the mouse one.. I felt they should have used the metal switch like dell which could be robust for the price we are paying. That's it for now. Cheers!
1,"I bought this product and found Keyboard is not working properly. I had requested for replacement of the product. But, the replaced product was not in good condition at all. I have returned all the keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle. However, the replaced product which I got today looks like the original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle were missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement.  I need to apply for replacement again which is really annoying. I think whoever from Amazon is reviewing these comments should immediately act on it to get the good sealed product with good condition should be delivered on time."
5,"Very good and interesting product. The silence while typing is very weird initially cause the feeling of keys while typing is same. Only complaint would be that mouse is size small and not most ergonomic, but cant complain too much at this price point."
5,A good keyboard with silent touch and mouse with silent click as expected. So far working well. Hope it lasts well. The functioning of the keys is much better than the earlier Logitech model that I was using.Packet delivery was professional.
3,"It is actually a silent keyboard when compared to other regular keyboards. Although it has some sound though from the key travel, it's not loud enough to disturb anyone outside the room. I am using a full size keyboard after years and it's actually quite comfortable after you get used to it.I do not like the mouse at all. It's not ergonomic design so using it for long working sessions is very uncomfortable. But that's least of the problems. The mouse hangs between two monitors which is very annoying. I have tried adjusting the settings but this problem hasn't resolved."
5,To unleash the full potential download Logitech Options software from Logitech to customize the mouse buttons and actions. To customize keyboard download Karabiner-Elements and you can map all the keys.Overall the experience is splendid and the keys are great for typing!!
5,"Logitech MK295 wireless keyboard and M220 wireless mouse combo is a great buy in terms of product quality. Buttons are really silent. This combo stands up to my expectation in terms of quality. I believe the Price is a little on higher side. If it could be priced in range of INR 1800 - INR 2000, it would make this product Superb value for money."
5,"I have used many logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the past, but this model is fun to use, just because of its silent feature. Many in the past has failed due to mouse click issues and dongle issues, hope this lives to the expectation."
5,"I was using mk275 logitech prior to this. Had a bad experience with that one, noisy keys, with couple of keys not working properly. Was skeptical about this one. BUT - this is an excellent keyboard. It really is silent! no noise. All keys have excellent feel, not missing any letters. It also has a capslock indicator. I would say its really a great keyboard and mouse combo. Go for it."
1,"the keyboard is great and very sleek and silent. but couple of keys not working when i used it. unfortunately i noticed the issue after the return window elapsed. now i am left with a keyboard without caps lock ,shift key and number 7"
4,"Quality is okay, but I think they are a bit expensive.  In this price, they should at least double the quantity, like 20 switches."
4,"I am a gamer and chose to buy the Outemu Reds to mod my keyboard. I bought 10 of them and switched my WASD, Space-bar, Esc, Enter and Backspace along with some other keys. Reds are naturally good for gaming because of their non tactile nature and suitable actuation force. And this is exactly what these Outemu switches deliver. These are excellent substitutes to Cherry MXs. But for just 10 switches a price of ₹600? These are great switches but are way overpriced. I like these switches and would have labelled them a perfect buy if not for the big price."
4,"Buy this only if the keys on your keyboard are hot swappable and don't make the mistake that I did.The keys that I got seem fine, but seem quite expensive for just 10 keys.Hopefully, I make use of this in the future."
2,"The keys have kind of inconsistent feed back. Some keys offer lighter click feel than others.For the asking price, it's not worth."
5,but costly. should have provided 20-30pcs
1,It destroyed my keyboard and I had to bear a loss
4,It's value for money
1,"Please double the pieces and people might actually buy it, we done these switches just for 10 key it has to be at-least 25 to 30"
1,"Check out websites like GenesisPC, Meckeys, StacksKB, Rectangles Store, etc. You will see better brand switches being sold for half the price of this one. The only reason people buy these overpriced Outemu switches is because they bought a cheap Redragon keyboard and thought buying these switches is cheaper than buying a new keyboard. Lets do some math shall we? 10 outemu switches cost Rs.679. For the Kumara K552, you'll need Rs.6000+ to buy a full set of switches for the keyboard. That's twice the price of the keyboard itself. For that price, you could buy the GK64 or Keychron K2 which are much better quality keyboards. It is crazy just how much they're charging for these switches."
3,"Outemus are standard 3 pin switches you'll find in most budget keyboards. So if you liked the switches that came with your keyboard, you'll like them.However, these are grossly overpriced. These cost roughly ₹69 per key but for that price, you'll get the best mechanical switches from Durock, Kailh, Gateron, even Glorious. Outemus should cost around ₹15/key so before you buy these take a look at the available alternatives.Look at StackKB, Meckeys, GenesisPC, Rectanges Store for more choices at better prices."
3,"Great clicky switches (Blues) with a uniform feel between all of them. Using for a musical rhythm sequencer without keycaps so can't say how they'll feel with them, but on the naked shaft, they feel good.This listing is really overpriced, really should be either half to a third of the price or twice to thrice as many switches."
3,Not that fast it's pretty slow couldn't work with it properly
5,"A really awesome keyboard, i was actually going for the cheap gaming keyboards like the Blaze 3 but This, it may be a bit costly for most of you all but trust me it’s worth it, this is the best RGB membrane keyboard ever! It may not be mechanical but do not ever go for the cheap gaming keyboards , this keyboard gives a premium, stealthy look and has alot of game lighting profilesPros1.durable2.Nice vibrant colors3 Nice quality membrane keys4. Almost everythingCons1. Not many lighting effects 2.COULD have been a Mechanical keyboard"
1,SO1. Very very small keys. For fast typers who use both hands to type at once. you won't be able to use it for typing as most of the times two keys will get pressed. SO A BIG NO FOR TYPING WORK.2. Very good backlight. Many colors. You can't assign any button any color you want. There are a lot of options you can choose from them.3. Not very suitable for gaming. Again because of small keys.4. The handrest is not very useful as it's plastic and will make sweating in no time.5. cheap built for 3.5 keyboard. All plastic.3/10 only for RBG lightning. Rest everything sucks with this keyboard.
4,"I know its costly but its worth your money! Logitech/any known branded products LAST LONGer than any random ones...Pros:Although its not mechanical, the keys feel very responsive!The lights on the keyboard look amazing and CAN be switched off with a hardware button on the keyboard.The software perfectly links up with my mouse (which is also Logitech!) and feels very seamless.Fits great on the"
5,"I had been contemplating to buy this for a long time. Went through numerous reviews and compared all other products in similar price range on offer. This was the best amongst all that I could review. It was delivered in excellent condition, well packed and timely delivery. I have been using it for over a month now and all is as expected. The RGB lights are well lit and you can change the zone lighting in 5 zones. There are 3-4 types of pulse settings for the lighting. They keys have a nice tactile feel and are broad and we'll placed. Works excellent."
5,"Have always used a Logitech as my keyboard for over 12 years now and haven't looked back since, have used Logitech G110 as my entry level gaming keyboard back in 2012 all the way upto G510S for which I added support for my self made train simulation coded in C++ back in 2015, also own a wireless Logitech keyboard which I have as a backup and have a multi device Logitech keyboard too which I use for texting on my phone, these keyboards last a good 2-3 years that's more than what I require given the fact that I code 10-12 hours a day."
2,"Good to use keyboard while it's new, but it is very difficult/not possible to clean it thoroughly. After about 6 months of usage they keys start to get jammed. I guess if I'm able to open and clean all keys then the experience may improve, but that's not possible with this keyboard. Better to go for one of cherry mx keyboards, than this one."
1,This is a terrible product by Logitech. I'm sad that I spent so much money on it and within 3 months of purchase the pain has started to come off the keycaps.A few keys do not work as they used to when the keyboard was new. I have to press some keys twice before it registers the keystroke.This is a really terrible product and I would NOT recommend anyone to purchase it.
5,Pros-#cheaper than most other high end keyboard#rgb coloring system very eye catching#accented keys#key press is unique and makes sound when pressed#Windows lock button#Braided wire ensures rough usageCons-#none reallyPlease buy this if you are playing DOTA/CS#
4,"The short review: The Logitech G213 (membrane) Keyboard looks great, feels good, and has a lot of features in combination that are very hard to find in one keyboard, especially an affordable one. Price, RGB, Media Keys & the “G” logo to match my mouse were my reasons for buying. I expect they’ll be yours too. If you want a decent quality, affordable, RGB, Gaming membrane keyboard, compare this one and the Corsair K55. Buy one. Push buttons and save up for that high end work horse you really want."
5,"Pros:1. Dedicated media keys and Windows toggle switch are a boon for gaming/media consumption and during content creation.2. Key response times are real quick.3. Spill resistance is a plus4. Function keys are programmable5. RGB all the way!Cons:1. Palm rest feels plasticky and not suitable for big hands like myself, it's not removable as well.2. Mecha-membrane keys may disappoint mechanical keyboard enthusiasts.3. Linux compatibility issues.4. Key markings get rubbed off within first few weeks of use."
5,"Don't think much just buy it. It's best buy for this price point.The best keyboard you can buy at this price. Don't go for any cheap mechanical keyboards as they can't provide you the experience Logitech stuff can provide. The RGB Lighting is highly customizable with Logitech Gaming Software and different RGB profiles can be made for different applications.Pros:-1. Quality of Logitech G series.2. Highly customizable RGB Lighting.3. Highly tactile mecha-membrane keys.4. Additional multimedia keys are available.5. In game-mode, selected keys could be blocked.Cons:-1. Made of plastic. Could be more sturdy.2. The RGB zones could have been more smaller and customizable.*3. Of course, it's not mechanical but I would not consider this as I'm not paying for mechanical one.My last opinion will be if your budget is limited and then just close your eyes and buy it. If you are new to Logitech G series then you'll fall in love with it."
5,Update - 22-Nov-19AVOID if you are gamer. The keys got stuck and need more pressing power and its irritating while playing FPS games. Go for better MX switch keyboard. I just replaced it with Corsair K70 and feels a huge difference.OLD Comment:The keyboard is good for gaming and it feels like you are using MX buttons but has membrane. Soft touch feels good when press.Small buttons but easy to use. Synced with mouse.

5,"The best RGB LED keyboard under this price segment. LED sync with G102 mouse is very good. Keyboard's button is very tactile and feels great when clicking. Response is very quick, multimedia keys also available which is more helpful for me."
3,"There's no way to keep pure white color. I don't care about rainbow colors. I just wanted pure white color which is not possible as you end up with light blue color instead (through their software) and their software (very bad) needs to be running in the bg (at least once per boot) to load the RGB setting that you set.All this was acceptable until I start experiencing sticky keys. E.g. You press alt key and when you release it, it still registers in the computer. So far experienced this with LShift and Option Key. It's rare but when it happens, it's very annoying and not acceptable on a ~₹4,000 keyboard. Those ultra cheap iBall membrane keyboards never gave sticky keys issue"
5,"Logitech's build quality ✅Most responsive membrane keys I've used ✅- Keys are quick and responsive for typing fast as well as gamingSoftware options for function keys , game mode etc. ✅Subtle RGB with 5 zones , its very practical for gaming / work and zones do not leak to other parts ✅ (see picture)RGB options in software ✅Media buttons ✅Lights for caps lock , num lock , scroll lock , game mode ✅ (see picture)Key caps ✅Braided cable ✅"

3,"After using the keyboard for just about 9 days... Key O and P are not functioning well. Being a developer this is quite inconvenient for me. The worst thing is... The product was delivered on 12th May. I am writing this review on 20th May. The return window got closed on 19th May. So.. yeah I can't return it.Also, I can't return it on Logitech's official website.. so, 3k got into the drain.Really Disappointed by Logitech!!!!!Update...After writing to the official logitech support, I was told to parcel the keyboard to their service center in Ghaziabad which I did and payed the charges as well. After about 20-25 days, I received my replacement from chennai which is working fine. I have to go through a lot of hassel on my own to get it replaced.  So, still disappointed with the services but since the replacement is working fine, changing rating from 1 to 3 star."
5,"after using it 4moths i write this ......... nice product... build quality is perfect key is awesome.... easy to handle........ design is also perfect......... i experienced the good performance from it.... for the budget and entry level this one is perfect compare to other entry level mechanical keyboard..... or any brand....... so if your budget allow on this price go for it,.... don't go for the cheap  mechanical because you will get disappointed from those cheap mechanical keyboard...."

5,"It comes with a Braided Cable which is stronger than your non braided cableskeys are actually faster than a normal membrane keyboard and you will feel the difference instantlykey LEDS r bright but brightness cannot be changed from the keyboard itself, you will have to use Logitech Gaming Softwarein the software you can set up macros, and you have a small range of rgb effects which you can customize easilyyou also have Game Mode, Media Keys, and a button for turning LEDs on and offThe build quality is amazing...it looks and feels premiumWrist rest works but is non detachableIt has Anti Ghosting so pressing multiple keys is not an issueOverall Its Worth The Money."
3,"Working fine till now , rgb is good , keys are responsive.Review updated- 25 August,2019Bought in feb,2019 For the past couple of months ,left shift key has started to stuck sometimes while pressing, which significantly hinders gaming performance. Emailed Logitech support ,they usually reply back in 2 weeks and they told me to do some basic troubleshooting methods like cleaning and all, which did not solve the issue obviously."

5,"This Keyboard is a perfect balance of reliability, and performance,It as actuation force of  50g and a 4mm of travel distance so key press are smooth and instantly registered. it comes handy in CSGo and other esports.the RGB is for the keys only and not backlite but it is not a deal breaker,with the Ghub software you can control the RGB lighting al though there are only 5 patterns it does the trick for me.10/10 would recommend."

1,"I've used it for 2 years and sold it on olx outta sheer frustration, price is the issue here, 4000 rupees here, sometimes even 4500, for that money you can get a compact 10 keyless design with better rgb illumination and better build quality not to mention far better aesthetics! It's like Logitech is charging for the brand name which isn't really a huge brand in the first place."
5,"PROS -1. Very comfortable to type and game with, key travel and responses are very good.2. Good sturdy build.3. Some youtubers said its quite noisy, but trust me, it isn't.4. The media shortcuts like volume controls, pause and forward buttons work wonders.5. The lighting according to me is excellent. It is not very flashy and its't dull either.6. The sweet sounds on the key press. Love it.7. The palm rest - You can work long hours with this keyboard without getting your hands tired up and aching.CONS -1. The keyboard is a little big than the standard ones.2. Some people said that it gets worn off after an year of use or so, something to keep in mind.Thats all i have to say about this keyboard at this point, I'd really recommend this product to people who are into typing for long hours or gaming, and have a price constraint of 3k bucks."
5,"Had this keyboard for 10 days now, and I have to say that I'm fairly satisfied. The build quality is pretty sturdy, and the keyboard is pretty satisfying to type and game on. Some things I've noticed:- The keys are not quite as soft as your usual membrane/laptop keyboard, but not as clicky as a mechanical keyboard either.- The wrist rest, while hard, is quite comfortable to use, and I haven't had any pain or stiffness in my hand after long hours of use.- The lighting isn't very bright, and does not have any brightness controls. The only control on the board itself is to turn the lights on or off, and any further customization needs to be done via Logitech's G-Hub. Another note is that the colors aren't near as vivid as on my G502 mouse, but that's quite acceptable given the pricing range.- The build is pretty sturdy, with minimal deck flex. The braided cable is also a rather nice touch.- My only gripe is that the lock key lights are about twice as bright as the keyboard's own backlighting, which doesn't make much sense.Other than that, there's not much else to say. It's a pretty good board at this price point, and at least presently, I'd recommend it. I'll update this review in case I notice any issues down the line."
5,"This is a great keyboard. The keys have the height and travel of the mechanical keyboard, but are super smooth on impact. It kind of gives you best of both sides - mechanical and membrane.It has very good RGB lighting under the keys. No light bleed like other cheaper RGB keyboards. Also, the keys are perfectly legible, in white, even when the RGB is turned off.I only wish this was a bit cheaper. May be around the 2500 mark. All in all, a great buy."
5,"Initially got a K55, but switched to this, mainly because I'm super-comfortable with the the key positions on Logitech keyboards. K55 has an additional set of keys on the left, which makes intuitive actions like hitting ESC, TAB etc  (left most keys) confusing (especially for people who are `used` to a standard keyboard layout)Extremely happy with the quality of Logitech G Prodigy G213. Lighting matches perfectly with my chassis and mouse (also Prodigy)"
5,I was in doubt whether to go for a mechanical keyboard or this one. Happy that I made correct decision. RGB colors are pleasant and the Logitech G hub software is very useful. Someone in their review that mentioned that the keys are stiff which made me think a lot before buying. It might be a problem with that particular keyboard. Typing is very comfortable and requires very little force to actuate.
4,Awesome product. While buying you should know that it is not mechanical. Keys are very light to touch. Wire is decently long. I don't like the part where you can see the led under the keyboard. It takes away the feel. The hand rest is good but not great and can be a bit uncomfortable at times. Sadly you cannot detach it. Though it depends on person to person. Keys are so light to touch that it's a breeze while typing but can be a bit annoying in games if not used to. I got this product at 2.95k in lighting deal so good deal for me.
5,Best keyboard ever it is not a mechanical keyboard but it sure feels like one it is worth the price it's built quality is also awesome and it have a lot of colours and patterns you can choose from it even have 1-12 macro keys so you can customise them to what u need the skip track and increase/decrease volume button are key and this keyboard has em
5,"It's a great Membrane keyboard which efficiently mimics the sound effect of a Mechanical keyboard. Media controls, backlit buttons, and customization are great options to have. You'll benefit from the Logitech G-Hub software if you have a Logitech mouse also, which eliminated the need of having another software in your PC/Laptop.Palm rest is good but it will take a lot of space on your table. Logitech reliability factors are a huge bonus, so it's unfair to compare this product with other so-called cheap Mechanical keyboards. 😜"
4,"Pros : Feels good to type , Build quality is nice, easy media access keys ,Keyboard stand is good, Spill proof aswellCons : RGB not providing 100% customizations , caps num, indication light is very bright than the other keys which may disturbe at night . it is a fairly big keyboad , Matt finish and can get dirty so easly ."
5,"I have tried many other backlit keyboards prior to trying this (all under ₹2K). The main reason I was reluctant was its price. It's expensive if you just want a backlit keyboard.Advantages -1. Backlit is only for keys and there's no light surrounding the keys. This helps a lot when you work in darkness as it reduces the over-all brightness around you.2. Backlit color not limited to 3 or 7. As they promise, there's a whole color palette to choose from. Choose any color, any shade with the software. Note that the software has to be downloaded from website of Logitech.3. Braided cables.4. Amount of key-travel is good.5. Keys are not tough nor very sensitive, I'll say just perfect.6. Multimedia keys - only the bare minimum ones that I need frequently. No useless macro keys to program and stuff.7. Prominent Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock and Windows Lock indicator.8. Has the context key on the right of spacebar. Useful if you want the context menu (the one you get by right-click of mouse) without touching mouse.Bonus: This is super ergonomic! Believe me when I say that. I am the guy who takes a while to get accustomed to a new keyboard. But the very first time I started typing on this it felt like magic! (no pun intended).Disadvantages -1. Once you configure the color for keyboard, the configuration is specific to the system on which the software is running. There's no on-board memory to store the color configuration.2. You can't customize color for individual keys. The keyboard is divided in 7 sections (3 sections in the alphabet side, 1 section in the middle where arrow keys are present and 1 section of num pad). Each section can have its own color.On the whole, worth the price and no regrets.If you're looking for a mechanical keyboard but don't have the budget to go above INR 5K, I would say, give this a shot. It's a membrane keyboard but I don't think that really counts as long as you enjoy using it."
4,The keyboard is a subtle product that reminds you now and then that it has an amazing response time rather wasting around 4k inr on wannabe mechanical keyboard go with this keyboard and I assure you that it won't be a let down at all keys are spaced amazingly and happens to have media control buttons as well for quick toggle for mute and unmute and remember that it's a membrane keyboard so don't get ready with your pitchforks out.
5,Please see the below pros and cons:Pros:1. Good build quality2. Color customizarion is present3. Keys can be reprogramme4. Key shape and alignments and placement of Multimedia are efficientCons:1. Haptic feedback is there but not like mechanical keyboards though after some days it will be fun to use.
5,"This keyboard definitely doesn't feel mechanical and is slightly mushy when you bottom out the keys, but it doesn't bother me much , the media controls work very well and are super convenient. The build quality is also quite good for the price and super ergonomic with that wrist rest it comes with . Transitioning from a mech keyboard, this definitely doesn't feel like one but it isn't a reason for you to not go for it . The rgb brightness is not super bright however i prefer this amount of brigtness , unlike my previous keyboard being too bright"
1,"When I bought this item, I had high hopes that this item will fit perfectly as mentioned in the description, and by going through reviews. First time I ordered this it was bent so it came under defective category and I placed a replacement order, but this time I received a cover that does not fit perfectly and it was a disappointment, to be honest. There was no perfect-cutout for touch id as it covered the same and the keys were not fitting perfectly inside so it was sort of above the keys. I would highly advise everyone to not waste 999/- on this one and instead get some cheap keyboard cover under 500 or something. As the seller is a ripper and in the package, you will receive a card that says 50 Paytm cashback on writing a good review. So use your brain and then decide. Peace ✌🏼"
1,This product is not for new MacBook with M1 .. As the keyboard touch screen area is of old model protector with key boxes ..If you are looking for new MacBook it’s not the right product .. I have purchased but unable to return .
5,Received today. Using for M1 MacBook Air 2020. Fits perfectly.Good quality packaging and product.Does not move while typing.All backlights visible. Works as expected.Note:It does NOT cover the power button (having touch ID) so that the fingerprint works well. So we'll need to be careful for spill protection around that area.
4,"I have been using this keyboard protector for quite some time now. I should say it looks good and it feels good too. It looks promising as my keyboard don't have to bear my fingerprints.Just one issue is , that I have to type a bit harder than before and as I am not used to this due to this I tend to do typos.By harder, I don't mean actual harder but one who uses macbook's magic keyboard can understand this. Without keyboard protector it feel like you are just rolling your finger but with this put on you will feel a bit of a pressure.It is very thin though but I would suggest to apply screen protector as after some time these keyboard protector leaves a permanent mark on the screen. I have already damaged my Dell's screen. No point of comparison though but just a suggestion.Well 600 is no small amount for this. I would prefer to look for some other options too."
1,Edges don't fit the keyboard corners. Leave spaces and odd gaps in all direction. It's not adhesive type so it remains loose and move away when key is pressed. Not spending worth Rs. 600. Its better to buy a good quality cover from know brand which comes around Rs.900.
4,The keyboard cover fits perfectly into each key and does not take away from they typing experience of the Mac. The only downside to the printed black keys is that the back light does not pass through each letter but rather only on the edge of each key.
1,"Don't go for it, it will be a waste of money. You can get other better options in less amount. I cant even see the lights of keyboard one it is places, quality is also not up to the mark."
5,I purchased this for my new MacBook Air M1 laptop and it is a perfrect key protecter.Its not covering the fingerprint button but fir for other keys.
5,Good quality product from the brand.Works well and feels good
1,it is like puffing out near space bar and backlight effect of keyboard is also not the bright after putting this stuff on keyboard
5,Very good product it is upto my expectations
5,Very nice premium quality product. It is a perfect fit. Definitely buy it is value for money. Very happy about buying it fit perfectly on my keyboard And gives a premium feel to it..

5,Perfect and good one
5,It's perfect for the new MacBook air M1(13inch) and retains the typing experience too.
5,"Fits perfectly on MacBook Air 2020, quality looks good too."
3,It's highly detailed and precise and fits perfectly but backlight of the keyboard won't work at all even at highest settings.
5,Product as described in the description. Totally satisfied with it. Fits properly on the new M1 MacBook air. Go for it.
5,Perfect fit

4,Can go for it.
5,The product is good and fits perfectly on the Macbook Air keyboard.
1,"Original review: Been using TVSE keyboards since 25 years (that's right!) and was justifiably frustrated with the new cramped up laptop keyboards. This one does not disappoint and has the legendary feel of a ""real keyboard"" (old timers will empathize with this feeling). All in all, a no nonsense keyboard that works exactly as expected and does not disappoint especially at this price point.Update January 2021:A few months down the line, the keys W, A, S, Z X stopped functioning. Obviously I expected to find a service center or some kind of call center number to redeem the One year warranty. Shockingly, there is no such thing where you can get it done. All they have are sales agents and the only toll free number advertised on the website was non functional despite trying it for a week. Feel extremely disappointed with a brand like TVSE not bothering with post sales. They probably think that their (once) legendary brand name will last forever and they can get away with shoddy service...On my part, I will never trust TVSE products again."
1,"The quality is very very worst, because the keyboard is very very very old and used. The keys are full of dust & rust formed in usb pin, almost used and old product. I returned back."
4,"I was expecting more from tvs. This keyboard falls in the budget category. And there are some drawback in it.1. The keyboard in itself is small, the same size you would get for a 500 rs keyboard.2. No long backspace. A keyboard and that to a tvs should not cut back in this area, when backspace is the most used key, it becomes cumbersome at the beginning to go far for reaching the backspace key esp for people with small fingers.3. No hand rest.  Make sure u have a good table to mitigate this issue.Overall the keyboard is smooth (but not butter smooth). The keys function as intended, been using it for 4 to 5 months now and no problem. Apart from the drawbacks that is what you get in a budget keyboard."
1,"👎👎👎👎 don’t see the brand always see who’s the seller..,,.,After use 30 days enter button not worksService centre not support Due to product Online purchase.....So disappointed Amazon says we can’t help..."
3,"This Keyboard is not as in picture....This keyboard don't have Power, Sleep, Wakeup buttons & this keyboard's box print price is ₹418/-....but in local market this keyboard cost ₹392/- as this don't have 3 Power buttons!!!BUT WITH LAPTOP OR PC USE THIS KEYBOARD QUALITY IS VERY GOOD & QUALITY OF KEYBOARD IS 4.5 OUT OF 5 STARS...!"
1,"I bought this product on Nov 17 but not used till September 19. I just plugged in few days ago, it's recognized by computer then suddenly the power is off. I tried with another port and another machine but not yet worked. Seems it's not worked in one day. Its very poor quality."
1,Some keys are not working and sometimes if we press a key it get typed multiple times...not worth purchasing it
1,"not power button, i returned, but amazon not returned my money"
1,"The keyboard is tinier than written spec in description, keys are good but backspace is smaller so it doesn't fit that well because you will be using backspace a lot like enter key."
5,Works well and is very well made for a keyboard of this price. Go for it when you are on a budget and you still want a well made good quality keyboard.
2,KB stopped working in 3 months flat. Did not expect this from TVSE keyboards. Add a bit more money and buy logitech or MS one. Dell also works just as good.
1,On the product description its written by the seller COUNTY OF ORIGN -INDIA  but in the product packaging it is written COUNTRY OF ORIGN -CHINAAnd it gives very slow input and the wire provided is too small
2,"I HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH NON-BRAND KEYBOARDS, BUT NOW I WENT FOR TVS AFTER LISTENING TO ITS POPULARITY. BUY IT IS NO GOOD."
5,Feel effort less while typing.Finger friendly Keyboards.Maintain TVS brand grade Quality.
5,I’m happy to buy this keyboard..It’s really good product..TVS has named it good…CHAMP KEYBOARD 😊In this pandemic we all have to work from home and i must say I’m really happy to buy this
2,"Nothing special to give extra points on review.....as usual like others in this segment......no loss no gain type item.......not to leave, not to promote after 2 months of use......ordinary like others in this price range"
3,"I've used this product for over months now and am satisfied for what it has offered to the price tag it came with. The comfort is average.It was delivered in three business days by amazon.The item is good. For what it cost, the keyboard gets the job done fine. This keyboard contains keys of the rigid-format type, especially for those who want to have the snack of the key strokes. The build quality is quite good enough.I wish the height adjustment would have been a bit higher so htat it would suffice people of all heights/short hands. Overall a Good Product."
5,Nice keyboard and value for money. Earlier I had TVS Champ Keyboard which lasted 8 years. very smooth keys and value for money.
1,"It is totally used products, usb have a rush on it , some keys are not working"
1,"I was waiting for it, it was urgent needed. But I got damaged product. And for replacement.. It is again 10 days later.What is this, they should understand the importance of the time."

4,Nice  keyboard
5,Good product
4,"This keyboard is great to use. Every keystroke is confident and is really a bargain at Rs. 500. But since I use a Macbook, a lot of the buttons like the display brightness control, volume control, play-pause, command button button don't work."
5,"Perfect keyboard for heavy typing,Smooth and flawless keys....No need to look beyond this TVS champ usb keyboardIndegenous and Precisely what one requires from a keyboard, I have tried dozens of brands at this budget none stood by as TVS."
1,Old product had to Return the product
2,Enter Key wasn't working properly so I had to return it. How can you sell someone a faulty product??
1,Its key will start writing double (if you type q it will write q1 and w will be typed w2) after 1 month and Amazon will tell there is no warranty on this product and you have to check it before buying. So I request do not purchase product without warranty otherwise you will also loose your money like me and Amazon will also not tell this is without warranty.
1,Not good productMade in China
1,made in china
1,It's Chinese replica.. I have original TVS champ was better.. this with low quality plastik.. I will submit a return n refund and also case of fraud in consumer court
2,"I bought few days back , the inverted key was not functioning. Hence asked for replacement. Again the replacement key board also has same problem ie.,  inverted comma key is not functioning. Why reputed company like TVS Electronics doing like this. cant they check their product correctly. I do not know what to do"
3,"Good keyboard, nice responsive keys, but the backspace button is way too small compared to standard keyboard..lost a lot of productivity due to it."
4,"Purchased at 599/- from Tvs electronic, Hyderabad based co. Via amazon.This is the ""Made in China"" product.I do support Indian companies. But Indian companies supports Chinese companies.Little bit confused regarding this product. (3.5stars out of 5)."
3,"The keys are not smooth and ergonomic to press.It is compact size, working fine. But can't use since it is hard keys"
1,Please don't buy it.. backspace key is too small..leads uncomfortable while typing.
4,"Keys are very very smooth. So far this is the best one I have used but unfortunately I had to return because of ""ctrl"" Key button which was not working properly. It was stuck everytime I used it, I had to restart the whole system for it to work."
5,TVs is best for keyboard
4,"This keyboard is good for general use. I am using it since a week. Till now i felt good. Keys are little bit hard. But that's ok because the response time is quick. Overall in this price, it's pretty decent"
2,It's not hard keys when we compare with original TVS keyboard it's good keys and keys are hard.This keyboard looks very smooth and keys are not good enough quality.
1,The product is not good. Some keys are stopped working within 3 months. It has one year warranty but I don't know whom to contact.  I have wasted the money.
5,great product... very soft and fast for typing...i m loving it...
4,Good making of the product.

5,I think key cap is quite small. If the key size is bigger than the gaming and typing experience is enhanced to next level. About the keyboard build quality at this price this keyboard provide very good features like RGB effect aluminium design brided cable much improve your experience. Also the mouse is very comfortable for long time using and with software support you can customise all buttons and DPI or RGB effects.

5,"This keyboard/mouse combo from cosmicbyte is actually a bang for the buck. I recently set up my average gaming pc and I was quiet tight on the budget and didn't wanna spend a lot on the keyboard so I went with this one and I'm certain I didn't make a mistake.You can't xompare this with any mechanical keyboard cos the sound and feel would be totally different, so does the price.The only thing I didn't like about this is the fact that the function keys can't be customised. No big deal here!Bottomline : It's a go from my side"
5,"Highly recommended for programmers and gamers who are looking for budget gaming keyboard and mouse combo. My typing speed has improved after using this keyboard and I have been using for longer working hours without any problem. It is a well built keyboard, you don't have to worry about the quality. It's a value for money product."
3,Video Player is loading.
4,Good for budget gaming. Good build material.But not a special one to buy you can adjust budget for mechanical keyboard or you can buy redgear semi-mechanical keyboard.Not bad choice but sometime i feel that this product could be more satisfying.What i didn't like-1 Only one led mode in keyboard.2 led modes in mouse are not smooth.3 keys are little high need arm rest.Otherwise fair keys performance and accoracy. Mouse gives premium feel but a little bit large in size.
5,"7th button of mouse is not working.I have replaced the combo but it still not working 😔I am updating this review,7th button of my mouse started working after reinstalling the software."
3,All good as described. I have been using this keyboard for writing purposes. I haven't used it for gaming at all.The paint peeled off the keyboard within about a month or so.The rest of the things are fine.
5,"I use this product for almost 12 hours per day (for Coding and gaming) since 5/6 months. It is not as worn out as I had expected for a keyboard in this budget. The mouse software is really good, it has DPI from 200 to 7200. The side buttons feel better than those in an expensive mouse. The keyboard feels a lot like a mechanical one & the RGB on both is amazing. Would recommend this for a budget gaming setup."
4,"Bought this combo 2 months back. The functioning is good, the keys are a little soft considering a mechanical keyboard but they are good. The only problem I faced was the RGB lights on the mouse stopped working yesterday i.e. within two months only and there is no option to return/replace the item"

2,Pros1. Sturdy design2. Backlit is good3. Keys feel like mechanical4. Value for moneyCons1. Key labels gets removed after couple of months usage
5,Keyboard came with a manufacturer fault then I replaced it and got a good one. It justifies its price. Value for money. Will recommend to budget gamer it feels like a mechanical keyboard and the mouse is pretty good considering it has its own software. Will add more to the review after more months
1,Waste product keyboard doesnt work after while waste product better buy some orther keyboard i replaced it 2 times even tho i got same dagamed products so pls dont waste ur money
4,I got this combo at just 1200 in great indian festival [normal prise 1699] excellant quality but rgb transprancy finisihing is not doen properly othrwise rgb effects are excellent (FN+8 does't work ) otherwise all good . No other compition at this prise only this combo have many rgb effects in mouse and keyboard both

5,Nice product. 👍
5,"I bought this product for gaming. It does good job but one problem with the mouse is the RGB lighting will not off even after laptop turned off, you have to remove the usb from laptop to off it. Keyboard is very good, it will give you the experience of  nearly a mechanical keyboard."
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"I am a casual gamer. The product is good, haven't found any issue till now.Keyboard can be a little bit sturdier but can't expect much from a reputed brand"
4,"Looks good , built quality goodNow will see how long this keyboard lastsOrderded replacement as keys were not working properly got a new one let's see how it works and last"
4,The lights are awesome except sometimes they don’t turn on. You need to replug the keyboard in order to make them work. Apart from that it works great and looks beautiful. Keys are soft and fun to type on.
5,"Got it for 1120 during the prime day sale one of the best pc peripheral you can get under this insane low price! Try to get it under 1400 if possible but for 1700 it's not worth the money, then I would recommend going for a true mechanical keyboard around 2000"
4,Video Player is loading.
5,"Go for it ..best in this segment. The keyboard feels good and comfortable to type on for hours and best for gaming . LEDs are great for the keyboard. As of the mouse , you get the best for this amount with macro settings and 10 led lighting presents."
3,the keyboard is epic at this  price point but the mouse you can't move while butterfly clicking I get pain in my hands after 2 hours and you can see my cps me doing butter fly click but while moving the mouse I get 5 cps
5,keyboard and mouse is awesomeRGB effect  is  goodThere is 9 effect of  RGB
5,Don't go for another keyboard in this price range. I purchased zebronic keyboard and I had a really bad experience. And this keyboard is way more better than others (in features & quality)
4,"I received my keyboard from amazon and the packaging was good. When I unboxed the keyboard I received the following:- Manual, Keyboard, and a sticker. I loved how this keyboard felt while typing. And yeah this is not a mechanical keyboard yet this gives a feel like a mechanical keyboard and I really liked this feature since it is a budget keyboard too. It also has 7 colors to choose from. If you're not satisfied with any of these then you can choose 3 rainbow modes and if you also don’t like these you can always turn off the keyboard. There’s also an option for breathing light. These all can be accessed without downloading any software; this means there are physical keys for changing all of the lights. By the way, the 7 colors are:- Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Frost Blue, Yellow, and White. This keyboard also has a feature to disable the Windows key while gaming. There are also options to remove some keys of the keyboard and replace them with your own keycaps (To be exact 25)."
4,Best Product In This Price Range So If U Budget Under 1500 so It's Best Keyboard Under This Price Segment Or This Keyboard Brightness Is like you can use easily on this keyboard on night time or brightness is much bit high
4,"Pros:+ The thickness is perfect. It neither feels to thick nor too thin.+ Covers the edge of the keyboard pretty well.+ Gives the keys a comfortable and natural texture for the ease of typing.+ The silicone between the keys is transparent, allowing the backlight to shine through.Cons:- Slight misalignment and air bubble around the numpad.- The hole for the Caps Lock light does not align, making it a bit difficult to tell if the Caps Lock is on.Overall it is a good keyboard skin and keeps dust out. The fit could have been better but it is not so bad that it becomes bothersome."
5,Exactly fit excellent quality as mentioned
3,The product is good but the typing experience with it is very average as the keyboard skin resists the hands for fast typing.
5,Amazing it fits perfect on my keyboard...the button pressing is very smooth ....I feel comfortable while typing..it help prevent going dust in my keyboard...very easy to clean ....it keeps my keyboard dust free
4,Products fits well in my HP pavillion 15- dk0050tx. Seems good but a bit less in adhesion as it rises up from many places specially corners.
5,"Oh man..never expected that it fits just as expected for my ho 15.6 inch laptop..thank you teamHopefully, it's going to last for longer duration"
3,Nice. Compact and fitting. But Can't use in night with backlite. Can't type fast.
5,"Compared to the best, its an ideal buy. The keys are comfortable and doesn't stick around while you type quick. It's a decent buy at this price.Lack of transparency at caps key is a let down"
5,"Perfect product and a must have! The best part about it is that even after putting the silicon cover, the back lights on the keyboard are distinctly visible. Provides good protection."
5,Good fit for my Hp Pavillion Gaming laptop
5,"General view :It fits perfectly for my HP Pavillion. Maybe the only negative feedback will be the caps light indicator not being aligned, but that doesn't bother me at all personally"
4,"It is a really good keyboard protector which fits my latest HP Pavilion perfectly, Only problem is that the key light doesn't pass through the protector better go with a transparent one."
4,"It looks quite natural after you have sticked it to your laptop keyboard. Fits pretty well. However, I'm not sure how durable it would be in terms of its adhesion."
5,Really good product but should have given feature to to use backled keys  as it covers the whole button so it's get difficult to type in night ...

1,It does no fit for my keyboardAnd worst thing is it doesn't even stick with the keys.

5,--> Price - 9/10 (₹ 626)--> Battery Life - 9/10--> Durability - 6/10--> Packaging - 8/10--> Delivery by Cloudtail - 9/10---------------------✔ IN THE BOX---------------------- Logitech Wireless Mouse- AA Battery- USB Nano receiver [You have my sympathies Type C users]-------------✔ PROS-------------- The Design - The sleek red version that I bought looks gorgeous next to my laptop. It's quite eye-catching if that's something you are looking for.- Battery life is great. I've been using it for almost over a month and still no problems. [That's how you do it Dell WM 126]- The mouse is quite light.- Build quality seems sturdy. The mouse has fallen from the table a couple of times and I've not seen any damage to it yet.- Performance and precision are good. I haven't faced any lags yet with the performance.-------------✘ CONS-------------- Quite small for my big hands. Extended usage can be problematic- The cover of the part where the battery goes feels very fragile.----------Verdict----------- I was not happy using Dell WM 126 that is why I ordered this one. Logitech is the winner between those two any given day.
5,"The mouse is really precise and sensitive. Also, the form factor of the bluetooth receiver is amazing, its so small that it does not stick out of your laptop, which is a big deal for me. Also it is not bulky leaving space for other USB devices, unlike many other.The battery life on this is awesome, i have been using it for a little over 6 months now and i didn't have to change the batteries yet, so that gives you an idea. The product is also really durable, as i dropped it a few times and except for a few minor scratches its perfectly fine.Although the price is a little high compared to several cheap alternatives in the market, the reliability and smoothness it delivers is something that you won't be getting else where."
4,"Very easy to use. It doesn't break even after falling so many times.Edit (After 6 months)Mouse stopped working, so I'm revising it to 2 stars. The warranty is also a hassle-filled option. They are asking me to go to a different city just to get a working piece. I will update this review as things proceed.Edit( After 10-12 days of writing the above text)Logitech replaced my mouse, and I'm really happy with them. Although it took 10-12 days but hey I have a new mouse now. I had to send it to them by mail. They were very friendly to me. 4 Stars from me."
1,"One star due to below experience, this product is indeed 5 star. Few findings :1. Battery last for 4-5 months easily. BLE is just awesome2. Design is nice and long hours usage does not hurt at all.3. i dropped it two times still is good.PLEASE BEWARE AFTER WARRANTY LOGITECH DOES NOT REPAIR OR FIX ANY PRODUCTS , JUST THROW THEM OFF. My logitech speakers work 10k are all waste now as they do not repair and now after 2 yrs usage and out of warranty and just crap."
3,"A very good and useful mouse. Small yet not tiny. Fits well in the palm, just short of the perfect size. Sensitivity is good. The best part is that they provided a Duracell battery with it.Update: After a year of use, it gets a bit unreliable. The click slips from the selected file, the battery (even a Duracell) gets drained within 3-4 months. Durability is not great if not bad."
1,"Received it before the estimate delivery date in good condition. Overall product is handy, sleek, ergonomic and up to the mark. It's quick in connecting. The best thing is it doesn't have that touch sensitive led light blinking all the time thus it saves battery. Wireless range for operating this mice is good as far as 8 to 10 meters effective and efficient. Logitech is best as usual in personal use peripherals.edit....... It has suddenly stopped working. I claimed for replacement as it is still in warranty period, I haven't received any response from the Logitech people."
1,"1) Bought it during amazon's great indian sale deal for 570 (Later realized that the same mouse is available during the off deal for lesser price for 490). So I paid more and amazon falsely disclaimed they had a deal price.2) The mouse died completely after a week and couldn't believe a  company like logitec can have a product this bad.The mouse power's on and immediately shutsoff itself and no explanation and cant exchange as it just crossed a week of purchase.So, I just gave 570Rs for Amazon's Charity.Please don't waste your money on this cheap device and false amazon deals. Totally disappointed and not making that mistake again."
4,"I have gifted Logitech M235 Wireless Mouse for my office colleague. As he described, this mouse is really power saving one, because this mouse is using only one battery cell from the last 7 months. Also, the on/off button can save your battery life for a longer time.It is a very comfortable and softer grip to use and the size of the mouse is small. Nano USB is kept inside the mouse, you have to plug into the USB socket to use on your system. This can be used on any OS like Windows, MAC, Linux, etc.This mouse is very light, easy to use, and gives you more comfortable for daily usage."
4,"Ordered a pair of M235 for my team working with Design Software such AutoCAD and Civil3D. After using it for 4 months, the guys have given excellent reviews on this product. Battery Life and especially the 'Make of the material'. After being dropped on hard Floor a couple times, the device just works fine.Highly recommended for people use Design Software which require precisionlove & regardsAJ"
5,"At the price, this is a really good mouse. The size if the mouse is comfortable to hold and move on the surface. The installation is hassle free and works perfectly with Windows, Mac and Linux. (Tried on these tree OS so far). The quality of the product if very good,PROS:1. Easy installation. Just like Plug and Play2. Comfortable handling3. Works on Mac and Linux as well4. On-Off button which saves the battery life"
4,"Looks good and comfortable for holding. Packaging was also good. Funny is , I thought to return it thinking they have missed Bluetooth USB connection, then after checking reviews came to know it was inside the mouse.People who bought Bluetooth mouse may think same like me. Careful, it will be there inside the mouse near battery cell.Lol.."
4,"I had bought this mouse five - six  months ago and my experience has been satisfactory...Honestly, the wireless range of the mouse isn't great but it gets the work done, the battery life though is pretty good as I haven't still replaced it and I must say, the clicks are oddly satisfying (or is it just me XD). What I really liked was that it offers a wireless dongle which supports the unifying technology by which you can use other keyboards or any other product made by Logitech which supports unifying technology (though you need to install a software to do that).Also the mouse is quite responsive."
5,"I am using this mouse since last 4 weeks. This is my review based on the experience so far.I got it in Rs.579. Thanks to Great Indian Festival sale of Amazon.Amazon delivered the product before delivery time which is commendable.In hand feel of the mouse is great. It's neither too big nor too small. You will feel that you're using a quality product. Mouse's performance is also good. I have used it from 5 ft distance and it still worked well.USB Nano Receiver is small enough to leave space to connect other USB devices on your laptop.The cover where battery and USB receiver looks a bit delicate. I have my doubts over how long it'll be good.OVERALL, YOU CAN BUY IT WITHOUT HESITATION."
5,"Okay. So I've bought this after a lot of research and found out to be perfectly made for my hands. This works flawlessly. I've used Lenovo, Dell and HP mouses before this. All were wireless, but the kind of connectivity this gives is very apt. Unify adapter is also a plus since I own Logitech wireless keyboard too and with this one connector I can attach moth my mouse and keyboard by occupying only one USB port which is great."
2,"Although the product works great, but there is one major flaw in Logitech's way of selling this mouse.If the Unifier or the receiver, which gets connected to your laptop, gets damaged, you have to of course go for buying a new one which actually costs way more than the Mouse itself. I had a hard time with Logitech Tech support asking me to Travel all the way to 20 KM's to get this corrected.In short, if your Unifier is damaged, you're doomed. You have to buy a new mouse. You cannot get Unifier at even 70% the price."
5,"Writing this after few months of usage.Pros:1. Light weight2. Good grip3. Sleek design.4. Fair size, not too big or small, although might feel small to some people.5. Good build quality. Accidentally dropped on the floor, but works awesome still.Cons:1. Might feel small to some people2. Might not be ideal for gaming."
5,"I used a previous Logitech wireless mouse for 10 years. That was probably the first wireless mouse by Logitech with a nano-recieverr. No matter how old it was it always felt cutting edge because it had 'wireless' and 'nano' in the name. For 10 long years the rat went everywhere where I went like a faithful dog, and did everything what I would command it to do perfectly.Then one day, it died silently.In the couple of years that followed, I tried to find a mouse that was better. Some had better looks, some better features which seldom worked. After getting tired of trying everything that didn't work I went back to this Logitech mouse, and voila, it worked like a charm. It may look bland, but make no mistake, this is a workhorse. And I am sure it will spend another 10 years by my side. This is a mouse but it is a dog."
1,"Mouse would have been good if it had worked. Looks nice. And i was comfortable using it when it worked. But within a month or so the reciever stopped working.  And the Logitech customer care is not responding to any calls or emails. Only response was a mail asking for satisfaction of customer service, i dont know what to tell them."
3,"There was a time when logitech products used to last long.  Not anymore!  This is my second purchase of M 235 mouse within 15 months.  I bought one in August 2017 - this came with a three year warranty.  The right click button (that was not used much at all) failed and had to take it to the service centre, where they replaced it.  The replacement (new) lasted less than 6 months with the scrolling function failing.  I'm a careful user who always cares and maintains items that I buy.  It is poor quality of mouse that causes failures.You may wonder why I end up buying this item again!  Reason is it has a unifying receiver and I'm able to use my Logitech wireless keyboard with it.  Other models with unifying receiver cost more.  Further, when you take the faulty item to the service centre, they replace it with a new one.  Hence the repeat purchase!About the ergonomics: my hands are medium size, but still this mouse feels tiny.  Prolonged use is very much uncomfortable.Battery: Comes with a Duracell battery installed.  I did not face any problem with battery life.  I used ordinary Rs10 AA size batteries for replacement and they give good life.Unifying receiver: You will see a red color square with a star on it on the top of the receiver.  When you buy new the receiver is inside the mouse - open the bottom cover by sliding it out, pull out the receiver, insert it into your USB port, remove the tag from the batter, switch on the mouse and you are good to go.  That brings me to another point - the bottom cover that covers the battery and usb receiver slot is difficult to slide out!Light: There is an led (just below the scroll wheel) that glows green when the mouse is switched on and when the battery power is good enough.  A few seconds after switching on the light goes away and does not stay on saving battery power.Unifying - This is done by downloading the  Logitech Unifying software.  Power on your logitech wireless keyboard, run unifying software and you will see an option to pair a new device that detects the other logitech devices.  Choose the device and voila your device is paired.  Beware that you can pair your device to only one receiver!This mouse was on offer at Rs499 - a real good deal and I went ahead and bought it."
2,"Pros:1. Good Battery Life2. Ergonomic and easy to hold.Cons:1. Wheel is loud and squeaky - from the beginning.2. Single click often results in double click - very annoying - started after 2 months of use3. While dragging and dropping - often the file is dropped midway through the procedure - unless you press the left button really HARD - this also started after 2 months.4. Difficult to select a portion of text, unless the left button is pressed very hard - same as above.Will get a HP wireless mouse this time."
5,"I already have one and with the purchase of a bigger monitor and switching between displays, I needed two of these devices. To differentiate between the devices attached to different laptops, I opted for the less appealing blue on black model. The product arrived on time in a battered outer Amazon box. The inside was the usual packing, pretty sturdy and the universal receiver as usual counterintuitively wedged next to the battery without any sticker telling you where it is.But the product is good. The earlier model I purchased nearly 19 months ago has been battered, bruised and has been left on and there is little by way of bruising on it. For that alone, this product is worth the price and the investment.The battery lasts upto 6 to 8 months (I use it pretty intensively and leave it on)The only beef I have is that the on-off switch is rather stubborn. The ribbed edge that allows you to slide it on or off is not particulary effective and often stays stuck and I prefer to leave it on instead of having it come off and in the process likely damage something on the PCB inside."
5,"this i brought after my R&D in internet. i found this is the best among all optical wireless mouses . good quality,duracell  battery  is free with the mouse. it has on off switch and low battery indication. another noticeable feature is it doesn't have light  led under the mouse is infrared. good choice"
5,Awesome mouse.. got it in lightning deal in just 579Rs.. using it since last one month.. no problem so far.. people complain about the size of the mouse but I feel its not that small just a bit smaller than a regular mouse.. size should never be a problem as we do not keep clicking 24X7.. small sleek and nice design with on/off switch at the bottom.. also got the universal receiver..they say we can connect multiple devices but i use it on a laptop so this feature is not beneficial for me..it requires one single AA size battery which comes free with the mouse..and the battery life stays longer if you switch the mouse off when not in use.. i heard someone using the same battery which came with the package for 6 months and its still running fine..lastly can fit easily in my laptop bag pouch..
5,Logitech mouse meets all your expectationsPros :1. Best Inexpensive mouse by logitech.2. Solid build quality.3. 10 meters range.4. Alkaline batteries included.5. Best design can be used by both left and right hand.6. Plug and play no need to install any drivers n software.7. Unifying receiver can be used with other compatible  devices.8. Rubberized grips on either side of mouse for better  grip.9. Works on all surfaces.Cons :1. None
2,"It's built cheaply and has a substandard button feedback. The top part of the mouse that forms the buttons is loose and rattles along when you move the mouse. The power button on the bottom has a fair amount of vertical play and so, rattles quite happily when you pick up the mouse to reposition it. ( depends if you're one of those people)The first mouse that I got had an issue with the USB receiver, it was too 'tight' to fit into the USB port because of poor QC (quality check). Currently using a replacement which was delivered promptly by Amazon.Please do yourself a favour and save/spend a little more for a better mouse. Logitech is not doing themselves any favour by producing this sort of cheap products but I suppose market share is more important than outright quality. Shallow times indeed!"
1,"Cheap quality product. Do not buy. U can go for other mouse in same price range. Build wuality is laughable, worst than other underdog brands.I thought logitech is a good brand and bought this mouse Its just disappointing to see logitech selling sub par products. Mouse always rattles feels like parts are not soldered properly, even the exterior buttons wiggle a lot while clicking clicks are not accurate, overall waste product if u want to purchase logitech products dont buy anything which is below 1k. U ll get sub standard hardware, poor build quality, unergonomic design and still costly. . . Choose wisely India this is not for us.."
4,"Using this mouse for over a month or two. Hence giving my review now.Connectivity - Easily connects with laptop within fraction of seconds.Mouse pointing - No lag.Feel in hand - My hand is huge (6 ft person), still it does not feels small or odd while using. One or two days are enough to get used to the small size of this mouse.Material - Not so flimsy nor high end look. Can manage.Warranty - Registered it on Lenovo website. Would get to know whether they honor it or not when time comes.Overall - 4/5 star.Tip - Do not remove the small bluetooth thing from your PC or Laptop. Use a 3.0 Usb port to connect the mouse."
4,"Well, if it wouldn't have been for my big hands, I would have given 5 stars for sure. I was using a Logitech wireless mouse before as well... it was a combo along with a keyboard, its size was bigger than this, so I guess after using that for over 1 year... my hands got used to its size & ergonomics. I am sure that after sometime, my hands will have a grip of this mouse as well and let me tell you that the reason, I stopped using the earlier L mouse was that it didn't have any issues, it's just that I threw it in anger more than 4-5 times, sometimes on the floor and at times of the wall as well... I won't go into the reason for that kind of anger but talking about the product, even after bearing that kind of torture, its body got a small crack from my last hard throw... otherwise, it was working as a charm and it is still working, just that it misses its click at times which I don't like... so I went ahead with this model. Other colors of this model were coming 150 more expensive, so i went ahead with this model at Rs 658... today I am checking, it's price has been revised back to the regular price of Rs 799.About the product, I wish it was a bit bigger but as I said, my hand will get used to it. Its heavy and gives a premium look too... it's not those kind of cheap wireless mouse from Portronics which are very light weight & looks fragile too. My nephew bought one for Rs 450 and really, as I said... though it comes with a warranty, I am sure it can't even bear the impact of a single throw. But this Logitech, though this time, I have no intention of throwing it around in anger, definitely can bear the impact... in fact, it looks more sturdy & far more stylish than my previous Logitech mouse. It is provided with a battery which Portronics doesn't provide and it's a premium battery... not like Nippo, or Everready etc. So, all in all it's a very stylish and extremely ergonomic mouse and if you are a lady with mediumsize hand, you will fall in love with it!I strongly recommend this product... especially at the price point I got it."
5,"Logitech is the brand I trust when it comes to the mouse. Their products are ergonomically designed and come with good built quality. Always look for an ergonomically designed mouse as we will be using them for long hours, and look no further than Logitech M235 Wireless Mouse if your budget is around 700. There is a better alternative to this if you can stretch your budget to 1200 RS. Logitech M337 is a Bluetooth mouse. Needless to mention that you don’t need to plug in a key to your laptop or desktop. Just pair a Bluetooth connection with all your devices, and you will be good to go.Consider upvoting this review if you found it useful. Thanks!"
4,"First off, this mouse from Logitech is ergonomic and fits perfectly in my hands. The bluetooth dongle just works. I have tried with different OS's like Win 10, Ubunutu. It works seamlessly with both.I am not a gamer so I won't comment on its suitability for that. The bluetooth dongle comes inside the mouse where the battery is inserted. That was a bit confusing initially. The pre-packaged battery was of poor quality and wore out within a week of use. I use the mouse for about 3-4 hours on weekdays and 8+ hours on weekends and with quality batteries it will last long.Would recommend this for daily and non-gaming purposes."
3,"I bought this one due to its price and well, it does work. from usage stand point i have had no issues so far. Where i have some concerns is what the cover for battery takes lot of struggle to open. it ain't easy. something is messed up with the design. the second issue with my piece is that the bottom LED that should glow when the mouse is on, and working, doesn't light's up (is most likely faulty). i didn't return/exchange as the mouse functionality is fine, so i will live with the other two issues.[updated]i am using this for few months now, but off late, it is stopped working..it consistently keeps faulting the USB on the laptop and stops working. I have another lenovo wireless mouse and it has been working like a charm, even when this one messes up the USB."
5,"As soon as I took out the mouse out of its packaging...it oozed quality. The hard plastic is high quality and so is the soft plastic along the sides, that helps you grip the mouse easily. The battery cover opens and closes with satisfying snap..Also high quality. The on/off button is bit tacky and not very satisfying...but you won't need to use it often, as the mouse doesn't work when it's not connected to your PC.The second thing that amused me was its lack of light. All the optical mouse that I had seen so far, had bright lights, that in my opinion drains the battery a lot quicker. So, after inserting the battery when the light was not showing near the sensor, I thought the mouse was broken or something. But, then it started pointing perfectly. I had to use it for a while to make sure, that is how it works. I checked with my phone camera to see if there is some invisible light(like infra red), and yes, there is. But, that too isn't continuous, and only flickers when you move the mouse. This means a very long life of the battery. I am deeply satisfied."
1,"Had bought from diwali sale.. with good discounts. But the product quality is not up to mark.The cursor apeed were lagging compare to mouse movement, had tried multiple speed setting in laptop but still results same its lagging.Compared with same mouse bought by friend from local shop and that was working absolutely fine..Looks like Diwali dhamaka ne mera diwala nikal diya.."
5,"I am a heavy user of mouse and use it average 10+ hours a day. Below is my reviewPRO's:1. Good battery life.2. Good for medium and smaller hands.3. Good life,.4. Good sensitivity & control.5. Easy to open and clean.What went bad:1. left click start loose its click & rebound capability after 3.5 years, along with button press sensitivity. requiring more force on left click button to work.2. Scroll response starts showing issues after 4 years.3. On\Off button operation is not very smooth to use regularly.Seems price got increased around 200 Rs by 4 years to 700 as I am righting this review."
5,"I bought this in November 2016 and reason I am reviewing it today to let future buyers know that this thing can take a beating and its a pleasure own this device. Let me clear the important thing first, the battery life. Logitech claims a year of battery life with this mouse and I can confirm that they are not lying. The battery will last a year if you a normal user which means if you use the mouse for 8 hours a day. My mouse stays on for at least 18 hours a day and sometime I forget to switch it off and it stays on for 40 hours straight. So for me the battery lasted 7 months. I changed it last month and I am not complaining.The build quality is great and both the buttons and scroll still works as new. The unifying receiver has not left my laptop's USB port at all, it is really a plug it and forget it kind of receiver. The range of the mouse is good, though I haven't tested that enough because I use my mouse on the same table where my laptop is. I have never felt any interference to any other wireless device because of this mouse. There is no lag while using it either. You can buy this mouse without thinking twice. Wait for the right price though. This mouse is a part of lightning deals all the time so buy it in deal. I got it for 499 in the deal."
5,"It’s a good product. Even though I am not a regular games addict, I use it for professional work and it is doing well. Only drawback is even though it is wireless, it’s adapter occupies one of the USB ports. My laptop only has 2 USB ports. One is blocked by cooling pad, another by mouse adapter so I at times have to stop cooling pad to connect USB drive. On the contrary advantage of this mouse adapter is it’s so small that I never have to detach it from my laptop, so there is no issue of misplacing it anywhere."
5,"Using this mouse for 2 weeks, and this is a mouse I was looking for years.This is just perfect -1. wireless (+absolutely no delay)2. high accuracy sensor3. perfect size and height, easiest to hold.4. compact receiver.5. Comes with 15 Amps 1.5 V Alkaline battery (Holds enough power to run for more than half year, although I'll edit review accordingly how much time it survive)I just cannot live without this mouse, and I am still writing review using this mouse, I just forgot about my laptop's track pad after using this mouse. Its quality is quite sturdy doesn't look to break easily.There is small (very tiny) circular rubber in all the four corners for letting it move very accurately without much of a friction from whole surface being in contact.There is a rubber-plastic grip in both sides (can be used by both left handed and right handed person) which holds enough traction that you don't need to hold it tightly yourself, its in your hand with ease.Only CON:Dirt settles in the area of clicks, so need to remove it with a cloth, 3 times / 2 week."
5,"This is a great wireless mouse by Logitech. This is the second time I am purchasing this mouse. The last time I purchased this same model, lasted me for almost 2 years and was working fine but I accidentally dropped it from 3rd floor and it broke.However, if you are looking for a gaming mouse then I would say that you should look elsewhere. This mouse performs okay during normal casual/campaign gaming but competitive gaming is a bit too much of this mouse to handle. You would struggle in games like csgo, pubg, r6 and games of such nature.But if you are looking for a typical wireless mouse with good looks and ergonomics, this is where your search should end imho!"
4,"I have been using it for a while. So, I'll jot the pros and cons down.Pros:1. Very ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my palm.2. Light-weight. It is one of the lightest wireless mice I've ever used. It even feels lighter than the Logitech M221 Silent mouse I own.3. Decent performance. I had have no issues with it whatsoever, except one time where it stopped working all of a sudden on the very first day itself! So, I had to remove the battery and reinsert it, which worked. Since that day, I never experienced this issue again.4. Decent click feedback. Although the clicks are not really silent, but the sound isn't too loud. The click feedback is decent too, as the travel isn't too much. If you need silent clicks on a budget, you can go with Logitech M221 Silent, which is also another nice model.5. 3-year warranty. It is one of the rare Logitech mice to have 3 years of warranty. Even the more expensive Logitech mice have just one year of warranty in India.Cons:1. If you try to shake it, both the left and right-click buttons rattle a lot. I'm not sure if it's an issue with only my unit or is something common in every unit.2. The scrollbar started making a wheezing sound during downwards scrolling after a week. But, somehow it got fixed on its own after 2 weeks. Strangely, I've got the same issue on my M221 Silent as well. So, apparently, it is a common issue with Logitech mice.Since the pros outweigh the cons, I would definitely recommend this mouse to anyone who is looking forward to purchasing a cheap wireless mouse. It certainly won't disappoint you."
5,"It's been one year and 3 months, and still using the battery that arrived with the package, Duracell. So I can't say if its Duracell or Logitech but the combination is excellent. Using almost every working day for 4-6 hours. Speed and accuracy is excellent.However, do note the size of your hand. I too felt it very small but I got used to it but still might be uncomfortable for people with big hands. So do have a look at the measurements."

1,It's looks amazing but my R key stopped working 2 weeks in.
5,I have been using an Apple Magic Keyboard for a long time. I recently had to switch to windows as part of my new job and I badly needed a windows friendly keyboard. Dis some research about mechanical keyboards and ended up buying this one. It’s ergonomic and the keys are giving good feedback when I type. RGB LEDs are of good quality and the light effects are amazing. Loved this keyboard. I will update the review if I come across any problems!
5,Amazing. It's so soft and premium keyboard. Best for typing and gaming. Just go for it if you wish for vibrant and premium keyboard.

4,"I have dell inspiron 15 3511. I would not call it a perfect fit. The page up and down should be on up and down arrow but on right and left. Aftr almost 10days, it fits ok.... Adhesiveness is not bad. Corner keys fits well... In the middle few are not"

5,Perfect
5,"Look at the photo. Can you see the cover? Ya that's how nicely it fits on the keyboard, a complete value for money investment. Hopefully it will be around for a while.There is one thing though, the tactile feel that you get from a Scissor Keyboard is somewhat lost, but then you get used to it.I recommend it to all those who are working from home and want a good level of protection against those cookies bits, splash of coffee every now and then and ya it does a good job in keeping that dirt away as well ;). Cheers"
1,Very bad
4,"Quality - ok, Looks - good, transparency - top notch. Adhesive to some extend that helps remain in place. Only thing I have seen with similar covers is that they get dirty easily but we will see. Good buy for the price."
3,This is a good product. Your keyboard can be saved from dust. I liked the quality. But it would be better if this could cover little more area till the edge.
5,"Fits perfectly to my Magic Keyboard, like a skin. I can work without worry. Whenever it gets dirty, just wash with water. No damage to keyboard or getting dirty. Value for money"
1,Video Player is loading.
4,It’s transparent so one really do not get know if it’s sitting on the keyboard. Fits well but it is not snuggly since you feel that sponginess when hitting the keys and it does slides a mm up and down. Horizontally (Sideways) it fits well. I guess that should go away after using it for some time once fingers get used to it.
1,"1 the cover comes off when I move the keyboard or while typing.2 it doesn't cover the keyboard fully, it only covers the buttons so it comes off easily3 make is very cheap and can get cut. Quality is not good.4 it is overpricedNeed a refund for this product."
4,"Every mac user should have this, good matt finish surface, perfectly fits on the surface, feels like nothing on the keyboard, protect from liquid splash, spill & dust."
1,"The tactile feel of the keyboard will be sacrificed. Use it as cover when not is use. Not very comfy for long regular use, you might have to get used to the feeling and feedback."
1,I bought it for 399. Definitely not worth that money. Very poor quality plastic (it's not silicon) fits perfectly but typing experience is ridiculous.If you're looking for silicon (like I am) don't go for this.
5,Fits really well
5,Excellent quality. Fits perfectly.

2,This product is of cheap quality and utterly disappointing and I deeply regret not returning it as it’s a waste of money. Amazon’s policy of not taking return of tech stuff in the first go is a terrible idea because you tend to get stuck with a tedious process of return. It’s so thin that I wonder if it’s silicone. Just a wee bit thicker than paper. The free keyboard cover I got for my laptop keyboard along with its cover is way better than this paper like cover under which typing is difficult and it is not a soft snug fit. It will only be used as a cover now to protect my keyboard from dust. No use while typing.
2,"Writing a review after using it for a week or so. The cover is nice at the start - feels nice and sticks. However, after few days, It turned hard. Due to its hardness - the pleasure and ease of writing disappeared and I choose to use the keyboard without the cover now. sad."

4,"Its not clear, has a little white appearance but its good if you want a keyboard protection specifically for your msi laptop. There are other ones at double the rate but this one does the job at its price."
5,Smooth fit
4,Little expensive..and low quality silicon
3,"props:1. for gaming and casual coding pretty the keyboard is very good2. keys are mechanical and feedback is also good3. the backlit is well performing and helps find keys easilycons:1. dirt magnet (seriously should provide a manual on how to get rid of the dirt), the dirt gets under the keys and jams the contact causing malfunctions2. no warranty"
2,"The description of this keyboard says ""anti ghosting for 26 keys"" but that doesn't really work. I highly advice looking elsewhere for a gaming mechanical keyboard as your multiple inputs won't register. That being said, the keyboard is pretty average, mine has no real problems and don't expect much, it's a mechanical keyboard for 1.7k. It gets the job done if you're using it for productivity or casual use but I'd recommend, if possible save up and get a better one like the redragon k552 or HK gaming gk61 instead of this, you'll have a much better experience"
5,"Okay, I think I have been using this from a while, and now I feel like I am eligible enough to write what's my experience is, I am not pro enough, but I think or I can say of sure that the keys are not hot swappable (means they can't be replaced) I and don't get me to be wrong, I am talking of the keys, not keycaps, the quality is good, and I will only mention the points, here, which can be improved (I am mentioning them in spite of knowing that it is the mech. keyboard at low price), but the most important and noteworthy thing is- the cable should be braided, I mean, I have zebronics zeb-war keyboard mouse combo priced at ~700 rs (699) and it has braided cable, and other thing is it should have wrist rest!"

4,"I've been using it primarily for coding and it's a pretty good keyboard. Granted I haven't used any other mechanical keyboard that I can benchmark this against, but I haven't faced any major issues with this so far.One minor annoyance though is that the if I don't hit the enter button at the right spot the keyboard doesn't pick it up for some reason. Took some time develop the muscle memory to hit the right spot. But this is not something that you should seriously consider as a reason to not buy this keyboard."
1,"The LED under the S key stopped working for me. Even the labeling on top of the keys is shoddy at best.Update: Very poor customer service, I sent back the product on the 20th and am yet to hear from them in next steps. The agents do not have any visibility or clarity.Given that keyboards are essential, best to rely on a brand that does not break in the first place.I am essentially looking at this keyboard being money wasted as I don't foresee any resolution."
4,"I may have received a defective product as the right shift key is missing stabilizers. This is a great keyboard for the price, some kind of average blue switches."
5,"This is juts made for people like us (programmers and penetration testers). And this keyboard is as promised. This has cool features like anti-ghosting, cool lights, Perfect clicks etc.. Go for it . And it's 100 starts for sturdiness. And over all value for money. Thanks RedGear for this amazing keyboard.."
1,"Very very bad, first when it came to me there was a bend in the USB cable. I fixed it myself and didn't complain about it because I knew that I bought a cheap keyboard, so far so good but after one month one key either doesn't register or register twice or trice. I read some same reviews. They are right exactly the same thing happened to me. Don't buy this keyboard, I had claimed my warranty and it's 15 days since they took it and didn't even respond yet."
1,Not easy to install.Frequent failure.Even though promt service for pickup of faulty product but takes longer time for repair.Yet to receive repaired/ replacement after pickup.It is not working even for one month and stops working. This is third time in four months .frequent breakdown causes buisness disruption and great loss.
5,Got a new keyboard with fully arranged layout. So happy to be the first customer to get this new layout update . Compatible with windows 12
5,"I'm currently writing this review by the keyboard itself. Its very clicky, satisfying and good. Don't waste your time searching for other keyboard. This is perfect. However I feel like there should be individual colours for the rgb options. This is the best keyboard for blue switches period."
3,"The keyboard I received had physical damage and it was not replaced because of some issue.However, the important issue here is that the keys are not very good. I have been using this keyboard for almost a month now but for me, I feel that I need to apply a lot of pressure on the keys, I expected the keys to be more sensitive."
1,"Edit: DO NOT BUY, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SHADY. I RMA'd it, they said they'd refund me, but the money hasn't appeared in my account after 5 days, they don't respond to any e-mails or calls. Pathetic.The ""e"" key has stopped working after just two months of light usage. Looking into an RMA. The keyboard's pretty okay-ish."
2,Keys stopped working.I've tried everything from cleaning the individual keys and the whole keyboard.Either the keystrokes don't register or there's multiple letters registered from a single press.It's been 4 months since i got it and it's already giving me a headache.Wouldn't recommend getting it.
3,"Thats right if u Press Shift And W to sprint and press 2, it wont register for some reason.I even got a return and got another keyboard same model, same issue in that one too. My older keyboards working just Fine.Otherwise no issues in keyboard"
1,I have been getting a issue with ghosting so i registed a comlaint on redgear. it took 2 week to replace then also same promblem
2,Received damage product as you can see in images and the quality if keyboard itself is barely okeh. Keys are small and sound of clicking isn't the best. The real cost of this should be nothing more than 1k but still deeply disappointed in it.
2,Video Player is loading.
4,"Very good gaming keyboard. RGB looks is also very good in this price range. Only thing is that the layout could be better, having the US standard."
1,Please for the budget also don't ever go to this company go to some other like Logitech or even Zebronics are better than this.
4,The key is worth the price... I'm using this key for alomost 3 months now.. And really enjoying this keyboard.. Redgear has provided a nice mechanical keyword with so much low prices
5,It's pretty good but u might need a hand rest for long typing sessions rest everything is pretty good considering the price
1,It was particularly bought for gaming. BUT only  2months now and the product is simply a waste of money. Pressing two keys at once will just prove my point after a few weeks as other reviews just state...
4,A good mechanical keyboard... But there are better keyboards at higher rates.
2,"It stops working in between and i have to unplug it and plug it again so that it starts working again, earlier i ordered the same thing before that was good enough but this one has disappointed me."
4,Rgb lite dont hv memory if i plug out it reset. Regrear logo was broken when i got it.so i fixed it with glue
5,Cheap and best. You can go for this 😄.. I have been using this for 2months ... Till now no issues....... I wish there was a wrist rest
1,Don't buy this keyboard.its keys are not working properly every keys are stuck some time not work buy a membrane keyboard if you want a better life of Ur keyboard.
5,"There are no reviews so far so I thought I could put one. I bought this keyboard for ₹1500. Trust me you'll never regret buying this keyboard. The blue switch feedback is very satisfying. Such an amazing keyboard for the price. Keycaps are on the little side of lower quality. But again for the price you can't argue more. If this comes under your budget, blindly go for it."
4,I was quite uncomfortable when i bought this because there were no reviews on this product.But still I bought this product because i wanted to support small companies.And you won't beleive that I was damn right..this product turned out to be just what the picture is showing..The quality of keyboard is quite awesome and i am very satisfied.The mouse is also very nice but i could feel something shaking inside it.I will give 5 stars to this if the company contacts me on my email: capbotants@gmail.comi HAVE SOME QUERIES.. COMPANY PLS CONTACT ME ON MY EMAIL ABOVE.
4,"Previously bought cosmic byte gk16 , many keys had different tension and actuation point . This one provides a much more consistent feel across all the keys , the switches provide good feedback and the spacebar is indeed pretty wobbly but isn't a big deal for me . Build quality is pretty good for the price . Overall I'm very satisfied ."
4,Keys feel alright. Not very smooth but smooth enough. Key stabilization is okay for most of the keys but the spacebar is really poor. Very wobbly. Colour effects are sufficient for the price. Feels really solid. Overall satisfied.
4,"Issue: Can't get into the BIOS.We wrote a nice review along with 14 pictures and a full video demo, Amazon said the review NOT ""comply with their guidelines"". What a pity you have to live with single line reviews from NOW ON !"
5,"Amazing keyboard under 1500/- the quality is also good , blue switch is amazing in this price point"
1,"I was quite skeptical about buying this, but I was quite happy after getting it and using it for a day or so. Even though there is a ghosting problem with the keys 'A' and 'D'.But after 13 days of normal usage, the key 'T' became partially non-functioning/responding (i.e. After pressing it 2 to 3 times it works for once ) but since the 10-day replacement was gone I tried to manage with it. Today it's the 18th day of using this keyboard, more than 7 keys have started to not function or partially function. Now it has been rendered useless.So in short don't go for this just cause it is a cheap mechanical keyboard."
5,PROS:* IT HAS RGB LIGHTING WITH ANTIGOSTING KEYS*IT IS CHEAPER IN MARKET*COMES WITH A NICE MOUSE WHICH IS GREATLY WORKS*IT HAS NICE QUALITY BRAIDED CABLE*GLASS AND METAL FINISH WHICH LOOKS GREATCONS:*THE FONT OF KEYS IN KEYBORD IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND*THERE IS NO DRIVER TO USE MOUSE SECONDARY KEYS AND WE HAVE INSTALL A THIRD PARTY RESOURCE*CANT ABLE TO CHANGE THE LIGHT SETTINGS IN KEYBOARD
4,I have this and another keyboard from other manufacturer with per key rgb but this one definitely feels premium in built quality compared to the other one. The keys are louder then the other blue switch keyboard which I hardly like. Wished they would have released another model with red switchs and rgb customization. Lighting looks subtle and letters on keycaps are visible without backlit. Worth to go for if you get within 1500-1600.
5,"The ONLY thing that one could dislike about this keyboard is the fact that the space bar is a bit wobbly, other than that, there is literally nothing negative about this keyboard; it has a metal top cover, mechanical blue switches that give off a satisfying noise, it's compact, which is good for gaming and I bought it for just 1700. The rgb doesn't really have a lot good combinations but I really can't complain here, all the other keyboards with features like these, would cost you atleast 2,400. If your budget is low and you want to use a mechanical keyboard, just close your eyes and go for this one."
5,Little bit small.  But best in prize
5,"Writing this review with the same keyboard, well while placing the order I was not expecting much quality however to my surprise it came out to be good. keys quality is decent and has a tactile feel to it. if you are an amid typist then probably you may appreciate the typing feel. It is lightweight but feels sturdy however rubber feet could have been better for on desk grip."
5,"This Is one of the most Rugged Gaming Key Board .Looks Very Similar to HPK500F but is 20% Cheaper than HP & Looks Much better & Rugged .Super Built , Awesome Lights , I m not a full time Gamer but love these Illuminating keys.Will Surely Refer to more friends of Mine"
5,Keyboard is amazing ! You can easily clean it ! Most importantly cable is amazing and seems durable compared to all other keyboards used until now !Very comfortable to use.More than I Expected because normally we see when keyboards are good cables are not and vice versa !Lit up amazingly will surely help me to work in the night or in the dark too !
5,"Value for money, brightness, build quality"
1,Worst Worst Worst experience first time....This is the worst experience neither i found the keyboard in the delivered package nor i got resolution for this issue from customer support associate of Amazon. I am shocked as well.
2,"After one week fully used the keyboard most keya are stucked example shift ,ctrl,alt keya so returned. Am really disappointed"
5,Video Player is loading.
5,It's a good mechanical keyboard it's a bang for the buck in 1800rupees keyboard is outstanding and it's LED light is also good
5,"Product is absolutely amazing. Totally loved it. Thank you COCO SPORTS . Now all my friends want to buy this combo too .Highly recommend... Worth the price., Kudos!!PS:Fun fact, I am typing using this keyboard right now...."
1,And the spacebar is wobbly. This isn't good for gaming or typing. Go for a membrane keyboard at this price
4,Nice keyboard for beginners.It is well worth the money if you are on a tight budget.
4,>Finishing on keys is not good.>Sounds Great.>Keys are Smooth.> If you want budget Mechanical Tenkeyless Keyboard go for it.
1,Keys are not working properly and light effects is also poor
4,Nice
1,Bekar
5,Super
5,"Referred this Combo Set to my relative . We are very regular users of Logitech but wanted a change . Was not sure if the the prod is good so after lots of hesitation took it . Product looks even more beautiful than the images . Light effect is classic . Built quality is extremely good . Key boards keys cap heads are unique & stylish . What else can u expect at such a throw away prices .Thanks amazon for introducing new product, new brands . Tired of using the typical familiar brands , this prod id full of new freshness"
5,"We actually bought for our use, however even my kids are using the same as they like the design and especially lighting on the device is excellent. It is very safe to use and even for handling. I suggest every one to buy and use the same.  Thank you for this wonderful product and quality product ."
5,"Better than expected , Awesome Sexy Key caps, Loving my office & gaming. Illumination of this set is awesome . Cable is very hard & very durable ."
3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
4,Video Player is loading.
1,"dont buy, i also saw a review but still thought to give a tryit will come out within 2 daysdosent stick properlyworthless to buy also not much options available though"
5,"Unlike what many have said,  this sticks as well as any silicon sheet should. It seems pointless to use an extra adhesive unless of course you are planning to paraglide with your laptop in hand. The quality is quite thick and offers a very good protection."
4,Packing was fine. And delivered to me on time. Product looks very thin. I expected some thinker but its not. Its size is perfect for 14inch laptop. But my problem is that this keypad cover is covering my HP laptop speaker which I dint notice while ordering so please who all order this product first check ur laptop speaker outlet and then buy. Its actually fulfil it purpose of resisting any dust and water spill so I recommend this product as it is value for money. I recommend this product.
5,I need to admit that this is a very nice product as well as very useful.Some things to remember before buying-1. Prefer buying this if u don't have black keyboard.2. U can't use it if u need to type for very long time.Best thing about this -1. It does not have so u can remove it and wash it and then can again use it2. Same as toldIn short it is a very nice product and I recommend you to buy it
4,"I have been using it on my thinkpad p14s for about 2 months. As you can see in the picture, it protects the keyboard from the dust very well. It's also pretty comfortable to type through it. Unless you are typing a lot, you don't need to remove it. One problem I've noticed is  that it's not much steaky. If you tilt the laptop much, it will get dislocated and fall off."
4,Got a 14 inch laptop? If yes then get this one and the only challenging part would be placing it. It covers the entire keyboard without issues and also covers an extra inch and a half on either sides. It is not too sticky either which I liked.
2,Very good product is the review the first time i bought this product. but now i am not at all impressed. the quality of the product has reduced rapidly. it was thicker earlier and it gave a very smooth effect while typing. Now its not smooth and its more like watery effect not at all firm and slips off. its a way to go from good to bad... the decline
5,It's good at this price range except little amount of the paper (on which the keyboard cover attached originally) remains stuck to it while removing it from the paper.Adhesion is good when applied.I can't say about durability as I am using it for three days only but it seems to be durable.
1,"The keyboard skin doesn't stick to the keyboard and keep falling/moving when typing. Also, the skin has scratches and small paper sticking to it.  Utterly disappointed."
3,"Securing the skin on the keyboard is the challenge. As per the product details, it should not move, once affixed on the keyboard, but this one moves around as one uses it. Need to secure the adherence by using cellophane tape, etc."
4,"Very good keypad protector. Sticks very well on smooth surface of my laptop. Transparent enough to see keys through it. Perfect for 14"" laptops."
4,"A very suitable and a reasonable product for a 14"" laptop. It can be placed properly on keyboard which does not remove on it's own.Not as transparent, but enough see through material.I guess it is washable, I haven't washed yet, so no idea.Packaging was perfect. Original and amazon."
2,Its gum is not sticky. Many times it slips from keyboard.
1,Worst product don't buy it does not stick well and it is very rough. It is a thin piece of silicone do not buy this in any condition it is total waste of money! I can't use it for long it is too hard to maintain and it will come off.
1,It sticked and looked very good on the first day.....then from second day it started falling off from the keyboard....adhesion is not good
1,Quality is not good.  It doesnt stickmproperly. Even if you blow from your mouth it blows down. Will not auggest
2,Very thin. No adhesion. Such priduct at such price is bad deal. I suggest you but it from a shop. At least you'll know what you're buying.
1,Worst buy doesn't even complies with required specifications...Amazon should allow negative rating for such products.Also return request not considered
1,"Cheap product, do not stick at all. Better to use a transparent plastic cover instead of this. Not worth more than 20-30 rupees."
1,"Worst product. Waste money. And  the intension seems to be, is to cheat hence no return policy. Vendor is not confident about the product hence no return.  Even if the replace the product will be the same, hence no use.Its not sticking properly."
2,"Adhesion was perfect when the piece was new. As the time passes, it is lifting up from all corners."
2,Doesn't stick to key board..keeps raising up from one end. Poor quality. Wont buy again.
2,Adhesion very poor. Not serving purpose of dust protection at all.
1,"Absolutely useless product.. doesnot stick to the surface not just ""no adhesive"" but also ""no vaccum effect"" that can let ot be fixed at a place. if u type quickly, its a mess with this product."
1,Worst product and packing.... Packing was a disaster... Returned once but even second time packing was worse.... Don't go for this one... Very thin as well. Go for some other
4,Sticks good...transparency average....But edges easily crumbles and seems overpriced.
3,Good for 14 inch models. It's universal for all 14 inch laltops
1,The product is not maintained and/or packed properly. The sheet has few folding and lines which might cause the sheet to get broken in those places. Not a good product. There is no value for the money paid
4,"The product is good, very thin, soft and looks good but the adehisive is not that good. So if u r planning for any silicon cover make shire u add extra adehisive like in the picture so that the cover wont fall"
5,Good one the most needed product for my laptop
3,After use it will starts moving around the laptop sticking problem
1,Quality is very bad. Rate is very high. Similar product we can get in local market under Rs 100.
1,I decided to buy this after seeing some good reviews but it was a bad idea. The cover won't stick to the keyboard and keeps on slipping off which makes it very iritating to type.
3,It keeps slipping off the keyboard.I had to stop using it after a couple of days since it was getting too irritating.Complete waste of money
3,Video Player is loading.
1,The transparency of the keyboard cover ismot sufficient enough...key board visibility reduces.
1,"The quality is bad... when I opened it, it had yellow stains on it which are very much visible. If there was an option to click pic and attach here I would have done that"
1,Extremely useless and no value for money. It does not stay put on the keypad. In just two days it came off and would stick in the keyboard.
1,Bad bad quality. Do not buy this instead search for other other company/product
1,Received used product. It seems product is not genuine Hp product.It happened with twice on Amazon to receive used second hand product.Very disappointed..Never recommended any one to buy from Amazon.
5,"I have got this product today in two day delivery and I paid Rs 80 as delivery charge. And also got some Cashback. Must go for it.Some amazing features like light weight, smooth buttons and convenient for typing purposes."
1,"Orininal c2500 wouldnt be like this, you can check with the original image on ad, and product delivered, the window logo on window key is the way you recognize the product original or copy. better another 200bucks and buy original. rather getting repaired with copy in 6months. and wires are too week, board is not too strong, ill break in one bend. keys will get loose soon..  worst."
1,If you are really looking for a key board for daily use buy HP-KU-1156 or equivalent. 6HD76AA model is waste of money in my opinion. Also better you buy keyboards directly form shops so that you will know what you are getting. Since there is no return on this item i am thinking of throwing it in dust bin.
4,"The keyboard & mouse set is of good build quality. It matched the online description. The keyboard has great tactile feedback and provides satisfaction while typing. The mouse has good response too, be it the scrolling or clicking, both feels prompt. The price may be a bit higher compared to other brands like Logitech, iBall or Zebronics, but that's just me, nitpicking. Overall the combo is a good deal I could get at ₹840/-."
5,"i brought for my ofc, its good for the price.Pros: soft, light weight, mouse is ful size and comfortable to hold, easy to clean design.Cons: letters should have been much more darker ( means more brighter white color font)....you can buy for normal use, not for gaming pls....."
1,"I got a really bad keyboard and mouse. The quality is so bad that the keyboard is not fully flat. It has a curve due to the extreme cheap plastic quality. I was to continue using it due to the urgency but then some of the keys wont work. I needed to press two times. Password wont work and did not know the issue. Horrible product. I returned and got a Logitech combo at same price and no words to compare. Very good build quality, finish and I am sure it will run for several years. May be this HP product is good but what I got is fake mostly."
1,Pros: Cheap. Simple with no gimmicksCons: The keys are very hard to press. Broke after 6 months some keys not working. Keyboard real model name K45Other Thoughts: To be honest this is the worst keyboard i have used till date. My old acer keyboard was so good it worked for 5+ years and the keys were also so soft. It's a cheapo crap in the name of HP. Avoid at all cost buy something else.
4,This set I had to get it replaced twice within warranty. I don't know why but  my Keyboard stopped working twice within the warranty period. This is the first time I am experiencing something from HP. Now it is working well and I hope it does so in the years to come. My previous keyboard (also HP lasted 7 years)
4,"Basic set of keyboard and mouse. I got this as my keyboard had stopped working . The keys are a bit noisy and lack the premium feel, as mentioned , this is a basic keyboard with mouse which will suit your basic surfing and office needs, won't be much useful for gaming or rigorous typing work."
3,"The mouse works fine, but the keyboard is made of cheap quality buttons that started getting stuck while typing. The main keys like the shift, space bar and the backspace are the ones that keeps ghosting often. You might want to consider getting another keyboard. Since, the combo was a value for money, I opted for this one. Not worth the problems."
4,"Good professional layout keyboard without any fancy keys. For normal typing, it works well. But, some lengthy keys like spacebar already make some horizontal movements. Need to see the reliability in the long run. HP used to make sturdy keyboards earlier that used to last forever. Going by current standards, it doesn't seem to be the case.Mouse is good. Not much complaints there."
2,"The mouse is very light, and, good to use.The keyboard, however, very low quality. The keys are hard. Have to hit and not touch. The cheaper iBall keyboard is better. Bought this because of a discount.  Cost was Rs 649. Gonna keep the mouse, but will buy iBall keyboard."
5,"If you are looking for simple wired keyboard and mouse for your daily office purposes, this product is perfect. The keys of the keyboard are very deep which gives a nice old-school sensation while typing. The mouse is also sturdy and smooth. I wish the keyboard was backlit so I could use it at night with the lights off. But despite that I would say that in the wired category this keyboard mouse pair is the best."
3,"I have ordered this HP C25000 keyboard &mouse combo on 21st Oct, 2020 at 8pm and received it on 23rd Oct, 2020 by 10:30 am(being a Prime subscriber). Isn't it a swift delivery, yes never had this fast delivery on any ecommerce site.Coming to product:Con's1. Yes it seems to be a copy of original HP C2500 one.2. The key board is small and keys are too short, I am a medium handed persona and I can't type fast using this small keys, if I press one key, it may type two letters. Not at all suggested for office work which have extensive keyboard usage.3. A couple of keys seems to be very loose like both Shift keys, and T and a couple more keys very loose.4. Many said there is not much key tap sound, but it makes considerable noise while typing.Pro's:1. Mouse is big enough and works perfectly awesome.2. Both keyboard and mouse seems to be strong enough to last more than an year.3. Lookwise, stunning. Perfectly designed and apeleaing in looks.4. Brand, but again for me it seems a copycat.Hope this review helps. Thanks."
5,"All over good.durability 1year minimum for gaming users..light weight around 200grams.No technical issue, Buttons are very attractive and sweatable in case of typing..you can definitely purchase this combo pack.it will be very beneficial to you."
1,"Hi,After getting this product the key was very smooth and so comfortable to use, but after some time key of the keyboard start becoming jams and now some of the keys also not working...same with mouse, scroll got jamsWill not prefer this product to anyone, if someone cares for their money then he/she should go for another option"
4,Likes :comfortablesleek design of keyboardBoth light weightDislike'Clikkkk' sound when you click on Mouse.you may hear little noise in keys when you press on keyoard.. but not that bad..I would still recommend to buy this as this looks decent and working as expected.
5,"I use this set with my HP laptop for Work-from-home situation. I have not been a fan of chiclet-keyboard of any non-Mac laptops. So, I wanted a low-cost external keyboard. Ordered this set and it works fine. Touch and feel of keys are good. Of course, that is maybe because I like old-school type of computer keyboards! Overall good experience. Bonus: This Mouse, I am even using it for my MacBook Pro. Mouse works 10 times better than the so called magic mouse from Apple. Lol!!"
4,Good Product. When i open the box. Space key in missing but its still in the box. i fix it by myself and its wprking properly. Very smooth keys. Mouse is also very comfortable.  functioning is proper. You can buy this . after all good product. I'm using this for typing ot gaming purpose.
4,If u r on a tight budget go for it. But if u can spend more than 3k there r better options including mechanical keyboards. Both the keyboard and the mouse have USB connector. Performance is satisfactory. For the Price its a good deal :)
3,"Super flexible, feels like a little more force can easily break it. Light though. Better than chiclet i.e. laptop-style keys as these are half-height. Certainly helps in gaming. Do feel a little mushy, and give that feeling like, oh, this is so obviously membrane, and certainly even the cheapest mechanical kb like those redgear/redragon/cosmic byte can beat it in terms of gaming and typing experience. For the price, though, can't really ask more. Spend a little more and do youself a favor, buy the redgear blaze 3."
3,Keyboard is super smooth. Awesome keys.  Mouse was ok for few days but  after 15 to 20 days of usage the middle mouse button stopped working.  Keyboard is very good and mouse is waste. Better buy Dell mouse.Better to buy keyboard individually than combo.
2,"I ordered it by mistake, very flimsy product..finishing is very bad...no special function keys...Mouse is also looking ugly and both are not a durable ones...Please consider a different one if you are planning for a long term usage guys..."
2,It is so noisy and flimsy. You will feel typewriter effect while using. Not for office use. Wasted money on this.I wanted to return but there is no such option.Bought another dell keyboard - kb216p. Very satisfied with that.
5,Using this keyboard I am writing this review. If you don't like to press buttons really hard and want to buttons to be fast n responsive then this is the best keyboard for the job. I am using this key board for 2-3 months give me plsr.
5,Nice product. Quality is good. And the keys are smooth of keyboard. And the mouse function is very smooth and clickable is very fast. I refer to others buy this product without any doubt or questions. And one the thing I am not tested for gaming or others to use this product. I using it in my HP Laptop for general uses.
1,Mouse doesn't navigate smoothly just in couple of weeks of use. The curosr gets stuck at one place and you need to lift and adjust the cursor. Did not expect such horrible quality from HP after paying a decent amount.
2,"The mouse is too small but working fine and clicks good and is very responsive. I didn't like the low quality keyboard which will bend when you press slightly. Not very responsive and doesn't feel like a decent quality keyboard. Zebronics keyboard was way better than this. don't buy seeing the ""hp"" branding. I am using the zebrronics keyboard now."
5,"I am using it for last 6 months WFH, the keyboard is very good, the buttons are nice and easy to type. The mouse is easy to use and works great. No complains.Bought from https://amzn.to/3l2h0EG , the service is fast."
4,Thought its a spring keyboard similar to TVS. But its a normal keyboard. Ok for the money spent as combo of mouse and keyboard costs same in the open market as have saved some money for travelling to the computer shop nearby
5,As I am writing review after 3-4 months it's  Working well the quality not enough but good purchase at this price. It is not a gaming keyboard but it's good for office work and students for programming. Loved the product go for it
5,Good quality product. It was having a good longevity and very much comfort to use it. I made this review after one month and my suggestion was that go for it.
5,Good prodect keys of keyboard are soft and mouse is excellentLoved it thanks Amazon 😗😗
4,Long Hua Switches..
1,Lung Hua switches not Cheery MX Blue FAKE
5,"Check the images I uploaded, especially the comparison with HP K100. In fact, there is no comparison of HP 100 with this keyboard. Because that is of 500 bucks and this one is five times costlier than that. The size of TVS Gold Bharat USB wired is big enough. More than it would have been awkward and uncomfortable.In looks, the keyboard is sturdy, solid and strong and in operation, it is soft and melodic key typing sounds. It is not noise if one likes the keyboard and if not then the sound is noise and size is absurd.I urge the sellers to upload the product images so that the customer could have a good look of product from angles to make the decision to buy. I also urge my fellow customers to please upload product images for being helpful to others. Hope mine will help someone else.The keyboard is as good as shown on the webpage in the product image. I thought the model must be older. But to my surprise, it is manufactured in Feb. 2020. Above all TVS electronics is Karnataka based company which make this keyboard an Indian product so on that count also I feel good to have this.It is with a USB keyboard. MRP is Rs. 2770 and I got at Rs. 2568/- as Appario Retail was selling more than it.Only thing i fear is that the colour of keywords on keys is less bright compared to other but that do not affect it's working.My views are that the product must go on for years and for such a product some cost has to be paid. I have two other regular mechanical keyboards lighter in weight and good performance, but this one has no comparison. This keyboard is not a 'use and throw' hardware. As I said it will get old with me. Hopefully I will need another mechanical keyboard in year 2030. Get it and forget to purchase any keyboards for years to come."
1,"I wish to return the item as it is a low quality item and nothing close to what a ""classic"" original TVS Mechanical keyboard should be. It has some inferior quality switches (Lung Hua make) and not the Cherry MX Switches that the original classic make used. This item was delivered on 22 June but I could check the item only today as I was out of town and due to COVID lockdown there were no options to reach home earlier. I reached home today in the morning and today in the afternoon I opened the item and I am not happy with the product and hence want to return. But unfortunately the return window closed yesterday and Amazon would not allow me to return the item. I request the seller to take a note and help me with a possible return."
4,"I had to return this keyboard.Just for context I use a CoolerMaster keyboard with cherry MX brown switches. I needed another keyboard for office but was looking for a cheaper alternatives with mechanical switches.This keyboard provided a great typing experience given the price point but I had to return it because it didn't matched three of my usecases.1. It's very big and bulky, it takes up a lot of real estate on my table where i keep dozen other things.2. The Chinese blue switches were pretty awesome in typing but very loud for my office use.3. The backspace button was small, I use it a lot and prefer it wider like in other standard layouts.Although the built quality is not that sturdy and can easily flex but i felt pretty confident that it would last long.Overall i would suggest to give this keyboard a try as it provides great typing experience with good tactile feedback without burning a hole in your pocket. It just didn't workout for my usecase."
2,"I was bit apprehensive since the key switches are not from original cherry mx manufacturers. However it turns out that the keys do have good tactile feedback and true mechanical feel. Happy with the purchase. Feels solid and durable.The only thing which bothers me is the missing Fn key. It should be possible to map the ""Menu"" key to ""Fn"" key using OS specific key mapping software ... but that will be a hassle. That is the only reason it has lost 1 star.EDITED ON 9 Feb 2021The key ""R"" was giving problems for past few months, I had to apply extra pressure to make it work and today it stopped working completely! I bought this on 12 Feb 2020, so I have 3 more days to claim 1 year manufacturer warranty but there is no TVS service center in my town and not sure if it is even worth it. The cherry MX like keyswitches are not user replaceable and local shop could not repair it. Though there is no issue with all other keys, I was hoping to replace the defective key with one of the number pad keyswitch but it is not designed that way. One important reason to buy mechanical keyboard is it's reliability too but looks like the keyswitches used are not high quality cherry MX switches but of some low quality. So I have reduced my rating to 2 stars."
5,"You will not get disappointed with this product ever. It has the best keys with a spring action. If you are a stock market trader or have a habit of pressing the keyboard with a heavy hand, you will love this product. I have been using TVS key board for the last 10 years and they simple awesome.  The Millenials may not like it as they are used to laptop keyboard which are soft."
5,"I was bought this for my employees. I thought it is a budget keyboard nothing fancy.But the performance is truly amazing. I never expected this much smooth. It is looks like old IBM keyboard.Previously I tried Redgear brown switch Kailh, Zebronics max pro blue - outemu switch.This TVS gold is absolutely fantastic.The design of the keyboard slightly curved in the middle is so good to type.I recommend for who used to coding a lot & typing large amount of text everyday.  I am enjoyed so much."
5,"One of the best mechanical keyboards at the price. It is clickety / clackly - ma not be great for really quiet offices, but just right for home use, the tactile response is just amazing. This is my second TVSE keyboard, the controller chip died on the previous one, and buying a new one is simpler than getting the controller chip replaced - AND yes, it will end up either in the plastic recycle bin or on a landfill somewhere.For the moment, am holding on to the old one, to see if I can replace the chip, when I have some time on my hands.Great for casual gaming as well !"
1,"There is no serial number mention in bill copy, Now the one Keyboard got errors, in service centre they asking for serial number In bill without that you cannot claim warranty like wise it comingI need solution"
1,"Duplicate product received, this is not cherry me blue product. This is Long Hua keys product which means clone of Cherry MX blue... Please Amazon sell only original genuine product. We trust you..."
5,"I was doing good research on keyboard for my mac However among all others options and choices my decisions were turning towards this keyboard only.. reason were, i have used it personally 10 yrs back, smooth cherrymax and click sound and long lasting it is.The challenge was, how will i use it with my Mac.  Since there are not much reviews around mac usage and secondly it is already popular for windows among others mechanical keyboards. So i did bit more digging, bought 2 connecters 1st for multi usb purpose and 2nd with type c port to connect to mac... And voilla this approch worked. Once arrived, have connected without any issue and it worked like charm for me. Additionally have changed windows key to cmd key which let me use it like normal mac keyboard. I am happy and feel comfortable in using the same.Thanks!"
5,"The legendary TVS GOLD is i believe one of the most widely distributed mechanical keyboards out there. This specific one that i got has Longhua switches and a small backspace button, so you will need a few days to get used to it. The pressure needed to press the switches is around 40grms, So you will feel very comfortable typing on it if you are upgrading from a membrane (or god forbid one of those chicklet style keyboards) All in all the keyboard feels heavenly and it comes with a pretty solid warranty as well, covered by TVS electronics. I would buy it again in a hearbeat."
4,NOT COMPARABLE  TO ALL SYSTEMS SOME KEYS DOES NOT WORK  AND OLD PATTERN DOES NOT WORK ON NEW SYSTEMS
5,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON IN 3 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ORDER. PACKING IS NOT GOOD FROM THE CONCERN. BUT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD AND NEW ONE. IAM A PROFESSIONAL TYPE WRITER. WORKING IN SYSTEM FOR LONG TIME IN EVERY DAY. MEMB' KEYBOARDS ARE NOT GOOD FOR TYPING. SO I SEARCH A GOOD MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FROM LONG TIME. FINALLY I FOUND THIS KEYBOARD RECENTLY. TYPING EXPERIENCE IS SO GOOD, KEYS ARE VERY STRONG. BUT ONLY THE PROBLEM, BACKSPACE KEY IS VERY SMALL. IT'S LOOKS LIKE A 90s KEYBOARDS LIKE IBM. OVER ALL I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THANKS TO TVS"
5,"I have two of these. The first one I bought many years ago and it is my primary keyboard and comes with the original blue Cherry MX switches.The second one I purchased for my parent's house when I am visiting and need to work from there. These are the Long switches and some folks have complained but I haven't been able to make out any difference in normal use.The keyboard is very clickety and works really well. Rugged. The original TVS gold keyboard I am using I purchased in 2016.For this price point, this is a solid, mechanical keyboard with made-in-india to boot. Will recommend it."
1,"I have used this product earlier. The keyboard itself works fine. But there is a catch. TVS has shipped a warranty registration card along with the product. To claim warranty, you have to post this card after writing your address and contact number.I am least interested in providing my contact details to TVS just to use the product. Also, TVS may reject warranty claims if this card is not posted. If the seller had written about it prominently on Amazon page, I would not buy the product at all."
5,"The TVS box packing looked little a bit beaten up but the keyboard itself looks like unused. Coming from a membrane keyboard, the feeling is amazing. My typing speed has improved by at least 10% compared to the membrane keyboard verified by typing speed test. This is the Long Hua blue switches.Works good on Mac but the numlock, printscreen, left click buttons doesn't seem to do anything on Mac. Scrolllock acts as screen brightness down, pause acts as brightness up. Maybe we can remap using USB Overdrive app in Mac. The backspace button is a bit smallIt is a joy to type on but might be noisy while typing in Zoom, Google Meets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Found Karabiner which remaps the unused keys in Mac and setting noise cancellation to max in zoom actually cancels all keyboard sounds"
2,Received a used product. Warranty sticker was removed and the body looked used and damaged. I had ordered the same product before and was satisfied with it. However for the second order received a probably used one. The keys do not make a clicking sound. I wouldn't recommend.
5,"Hello Friends ,I tried 3 keyboards before settling down on this one.1. Zebronics max pro :2. Cosmic byte - CB-GK-13 brown switch .3. TVS gold bharat :out of three, tvs is just the best .I was looking for keyboard only for work purpose i.e coding/programming.This keyboard is just best. don't think, just go for it. you won't regret it."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Definitely hands down the best budget mechanical keyboard in the market. It's really good for its price. The typing feels awesome and can't stop till fingers hurt. Not a great one for gaming but purely for typing.
5,"I am using this key board for a couple of weeks and it is ok ; only with a longer use can I give a proper review. But the reason why I bought this, is because my dad uses a similar TVS Gold keyboard, which he bought in 1996 and it is still working perfectly fine. That’s 24 years! Made in India rocks!"
1,If you want a good mechanical keyboard without any freaking RGB stuff and gimmicks then go for it earlier i was using tvs gold prime with cherry mx red so it was obvious that after using that tvs keyboard would be my next choice but the seller is selling it way above mrp its actual mrp is 2100 but i got it for 2700₹ that's not fair but still tvs is a good brand with good service get the warranty extension by buying the 1 year warranty extension plan from tvs for 150₹ only .Note from 2018 onwards tvs has started using long hua Chinese clons of cherry mx but still they are great.Edit reviewThis keyboard stopped working within replacement days i have ordered the replacement version hope so it comes fine rest i will update :)
1,"Don’t buy this compromised product. I had requested for return and refund, but Amazon did a replacement. I am not going to use it just because amazon thinks my problem was with the particular piece. These are made from substandard materials."
1,"Within six months keys stop working. It's not doing any action on keypress. After spending Rs 2675, working like this then it's not value for money. Very disappointed by TVS Gold :("
5,"Once you use this, you will never downgrade back to non mechanical keyboard. Most affordable mechanical keyboard and most importantly its made in India by an Indian company.  Now I feel people and companies should buy only mechanical keyboards as it lasts long and increases productivity. You look forward to type rather than avoiding. Brings joy to typing."
1,"I have just wasted my Rs. 2600 on this item, as no local service center is available and serial number mismatch on invoice and product, and Amazon CC executives were behaving rudely and told me that i should have checked serial number on delivery. So beware of this seller."
5,"My father is using this keyboards for years and so I also replaced my new keyboard with this very expensive TVS Gold. To be honest, you will notuse ANY keyboard once you will try this. This is almost immortal and amazing keyboard for extensive users. Highly recommend."
1,"I am utterly disappointed by the product. There is no click on the P key and the print is wearing off on frequently used keys after just ~20 days of use.I paid ~2700+ for this keyboard when cheaper keyboards were available, and didn't deserve this."
4,Good quality keyboard. Definitely the you can get at this price point. The only problem I faced is that is layout is different than most laptop keyboards these days. In particular the \ key and Ctrl key are placed to differently that I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also it is a bit too big.
5,"buyed this for working with zbrush software.there is no ghosting issues.keys are soft,and you can hear a clicky satisfying sound like the sound from we click on mouse.i also wanted the numberpad,because in blender,i can rotate the viewport,so it comes handy.i also found that they test every single keyboard and add a sticker on the back of the keyboard,and tick it with a pen.nice build quality also.the problem i faced that my desk tray doesn't fit this keyboard.so i rebuild my desk for this keyboard to fit in.and this keyboard also have a classic vibe and aesthetically pleasing.i hope my review is helpful to you😇"
5,Keys are very soft now I can type more than 50 wpm I do typing daily for more than 3 hrs. I would recommend for those who wants to type faster and for thosewho types daily for  more than 1 hour
3,"comfortable but very noisy, due to lower quality of switches used the TVS seems to have stopped using the high quality cherry keys and opted for cheaper chinese version.TVS seems to have lowered the standards and raised prices."
3,"TVS Gold is always all-time favorite KB for developers, yes the quality is not that good compare to what TVS used to produce in older times. But in the current market TVS KB is the best option.only one issue from the amazon supplier, I got the physical GST bill of someone else in package."
4,Nothing can beat the clippity clappity of a mech keyboard and this one does that just fine. The keyboard is however very clunky. I was surprised with the size of the kb when I opened the packing to be honest. I would have preferred something much too smaller but I couldn't find any tkl at that price. Overall a good buy.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"Yet, I find it costlier than what I think should be the price of it with 15-20% overvaluation."
4,"Excellent build. Small backspace key, adopted to it quickly, it didn't matter to me as it would. It was a negatives before buying.Typing this review with same keyboard 3 months of use. clicks are like music."
2,"It should not be called TVS Gold Bharat as they are using Chinese switches.Keys are comfortable, keyboard is ergonomical, good for long typing sessions.I expected original Cherry MX blue keyboard."
5,"Nice and soft cover, easy to apply and fits the keyboard and stick to it, 2 downside is that, the key letters are opaque so in dark room, one outline of keys appear but not the letters, and other downside is that the key indicator light like volume off button, trackpad off button, power button leds are not visible"

4,"Works the way it's described ,but received a multicoloured backlit ..inhad orders for a single lit  still looks decent"
5,"The keyboard is too good, felxable, very light too good user friendly"
4,Must have for Tv  IoT and Android devices.
5,The keyboard was delivered in attractive packaging. With instructions and a carry bag. generally I am more than pleasantly surprised with the product received. Keyboard work perfectly with my android mobile and laptop. Good value for money
5,I received the product in a very good condition. Product quality is appreciative.Value for money.Connects easily and is handy. Keys are in perfect state and smooth to operate.
1,As per product page information it says this keyboard has Bluetooth + USB Connectivity. But only Bluetooth is working you can not use it as USB Keyboard using Cable.
5,"This keyboard is amazing:1. Super sleek and portable, also very lightweight.2. Connects with multiple devices and you can toggle seamlessly3. Has interface for both Mac and Windows: able to work between an iPad, MacBook and Windows laptop. All iOS and windows shortcuts work.4. Premium build quality with long battery life."
5,Outstanding quality at an amazing price. This keyboard by far exceeded my expectations….will purchase more....

5,"This is a fantastic product!Now i can operate my computer, laptop and TV from distance without any kind of hassle!!I request “OpenUp” (Seller) to bring more product like this in India."
1,Waste product waste of money and dosend give refund
5,"I borrowed this keyboard from one of my friends for my trip to Jaipur from Kolkata. It was really helpful, easy to carry and no need of mouse as the trackpad works perfectly smooth. There was no lag in using it and it was fast and spontaneous. I am buying it for myself now. Highly recommended!"
5,Outstanding quality at an amazing price. This keyboard by far exceeded my expectations….will purchase more....
5,"Very nice quality, fast delivery. Its good fit for dell g15 5510 model."
4,"Wish the skin was a little cheaper, but no complaints about the quality. It fits the Dell G15 perfectly and the typing experience isn't too bad."
5,Perfect fit. Very convenient. Functionality is 100%.
1,"Item not as described in the picture, low quality over priced product. Do not buy. There was no packaging and edges of the stand were damaged."
5,"I have already bought Saco transparent cover for my 3 year old laptop and just loved it for its softness and light weight.Now I wanted another cover for my newer laptop and decided to buy the ""BLACK"" version - BIG MISTAKE! The black cover COMPLETELY blocks the keyboard's backlight. You won't be able to see the which key is which, you just have light emitting from the key borders. Hence the laptop's backlight feature is rendered useless by the black version.Oh and you CAN'T return this item, Amazon only allows replacement, they will send exactly the same model as a replacement. So make sure you buy the TRANSPARENT version for your backlit keyboard."
4,"It looks good, and doesn't mess with the look of the laptop unlike older skins that would look ugly when applied. It's easy to install, as in you just place it over the keyboard and it pretty much fits like a glove.That makes it great for dust protection, but I'm not sure it will be spill proof, especially if the spill happens around the edges, because it's not sealed completely at the edges. When you type or when you look at it from the side, there are tiny gapsbthat appear to be present which is enough for a liquid to get through. It's like an umbrella. Your head remains dry because it's directly under it, but your shoulders/back are gonna get slightly wet.I basically need it for dust protection, so I'm all good, but whoever is buying for spill protection need to keep this in mind."
5,Perfectly fit to my hp laptop 15.6 inch
5,"I could've put up photos but that wouldn't help one bit.Let me instead describe how amazing of a product this is, at least it's first impressions.IT IS THINIT IS CRAZY THINI was truly amazed at how thin and flexible it was!It fits my hp pavilion 16 keyboard perfectly. The shallow key cut-outs fit the keycaps absolutely perfectly! Although originally designed for the hp pavilion 15, both laptops have the same keyboard.When you first open it, it feels slightly tacky on the underside, giving it a phenomenal grip on your keys. It just stays there unless you try to pick at it and pry it away. It comes off effortlessly when you want it to give it a quick wash.When you type with this cover in place, it's a really nice soft touch feel while typing, honestly I love the silicone feel while typing as compared to the stock plastic keyboard feel.Well done Saco! Hands down the best 370 rupees I've ever spent on a computer accessory."
4,"Great for protection from tiny things and dust entering into the keyboard.I use it with pavillion gaming and it makes my keyboard look visually appealing and better. As the original keyboard is black with violet backlight lettering.It isn't quite appealing and eye friendly while the backlight is off.But you cannot use this keyboard in pitch dark as after turning the backlight on especially the violet on pavillion gaming, this turns visibility into zero. You just can't read any letteing."
5,"Check the images shown in Amazon precisely and choose which type of skin do you need. The main difference is the corner shape of keys. Check on your laptop whether the key is sharp cornered or curved and select what you need.I wonder how Saco made this fantastic product fits this much perfectly. That skin gives the incredible aesthetic look to my laptop.PROS1. Keenly detailed key corners.2. Very fast delivery.3. Good material Quality.4. Perfect lettering5. Allignment with the keys are just mindblowing.CONS1. Adhesion property is average,  mainly near space bar,  but it is ok.2. We have to look sharply to find whether the caps lock light is on or not.I recommend all to buy this one for protecting your laptop with awesome looks. Because its worth for the money we are giving."
5,My laptop model HP 15- bs662TU wasn't listed in the description but looking at the pictures i thot it will fit and it did perfectly. Quality too is good.Only problem was the on/off light indicator for Caps lock and F6 Mute key was not visible at all in case of black cover. Otherwise its awesome.
4,"I replaced my 10 yr old regular silicon keyboard cover with this.  Also, I liked the the high degree of care the company has put in to make the product. the cover is as thin as possible making it not to touch the screen when the lid is closed. The keys printed on the cover is slippery enough to match the texture of the original keys on the keyboard that the difference can only be felt by a high speed typing person."
5,"Fits perfectly in my 16"" laptop but price could have been on the lower side a bit. Thickness is good, key press feels soft and easy, quality is good. Adhesion is good as long as you dont pluck it out."
4,"Product is awesome, i bought this one earlier in the year of 2017. So i bought it for my friend too, but the quality a bit differs than mine. My earlier quality of product is much better than this new one but yes product is awesome and fit it accurately.Thanks for this product, i will suggest others too but make sure the quality keep in that way.. :)"
5,The product quality is very good. If you see the picture you one can't make the difference. It's a perfect fit for my HP 15inch laptop. Only drawback is it doesn't have a self adhesive so have to just place it on the keyboard. Self adhesive would have been a added advantage.
5,Adhesion is great with static hold. Looks and feels durable. Nice raised edges lets you type very fast without slip and double key press errors. Only gripe being the caps lock LED window does not line up accurately. Otherwise fantastic product. Full value for money.
5,Pros:1. Thin film but sturdy2. Adhesion is good. It will not fall off even if you tilt your laptop.3. Fit is almost perfect.Cons:1. High price2. Capslock and mute key alignment is not perfect but it will not affect your typing performance.
5,Perfect keyboard skin. Washable and perfect item. Worth the money. The only problem is with the Caps Lock LED. You can't find out that the CAPS LOCK IS ON OR OFF when this skin is applied on the keyboard. Rest everything is Awesome

5,Perfect fit for my HP 15s-eq0144AU...Material is sleek and it's a snug fit.On a grey color keyboard black protector gives more visibility of keys....overall happy with the products.
5,It is for straight corner hp 15.6 inch laptops. It can easily fit with the laptop.white printed letters on black background was prominent and crystal clear. It can be easily used put on the laptop.
4,"The keyboard cover is expensive, but is a perfect fit for the HP 15.6"" laptop with a separate number keyboard. Will recommend if price is not an issue. I think it actually costs 50/- to make."
5,A perfect silicone like soft cover with minimal thickness. Perfectly fitted. A must buy for those eho kept their laptops open for long hours like for a full movie -- it will resist dust accumulation -- thus long life of keyboard. No problem in typing. Value for money.
3,Good for daytime and to protect your keyboard from dust. But during night time the letters are not visible. So your back-lit keyboard is useless if you use this cover during night.
5,"Key fitting and quality is very good. I never feel that i am using cover on my keyboard, it is very smooth and exactly replica of keyboard. Very good product. I used this product from last 4 years. Then again i purchased this product for my second laptop."
5,Perfect fit for my Laptop.( HP 15-DA1058TU)  .You will not even feel that there is a cover  on your keyboard. Quality seems to be good too.I feel the  Price is little higher  since for this price you can get a key board itself .
5,"HP probably uses the same keyboard mold for their 15 inch laptops, so if your laptop has a full size keyboard and squared keycaps it will most likely fit it"
5,It does give protection to my keyboard as I was worried that too much dust was entering through it. Fits perfectly fine on my HP Laptop. Typing through this is also working fine. Overall no complaints regarding the purchase.
4,I ordered it for my HP Spectre 15.6 inches and it fits perfectly well. Does not let dust particles penetrate through and gives a smooth typing experience. The only drawback is the keys are not visible at night when you use a back-lit keyboard.
4,"Strongly recommend. It's perfectly fit for hp15s-gr0012au. Have some cutout issue in caps lock and mute button, as backlit not match with cutting. Other than that all is ok. Very thin, good quality. I got this for ₹ 373/-. You will forgot that it is applied on your keyboard after some days. 😅👍"
4,I received the product before the estimated date I’m happy for thatProduct perfectly suitable for 15.6 inc laptop keyboards the product quality above average and  cost is little high. This product will not allow keyboard backlight to project outside you can’t identify which key is that.? Better buy transparent
5,"It is a great purchase, adhesion is a little weak but fits perfect and looks awesome. ""Tell you what it is better than a plain and ugly silicone covers you get. And I had to get this causes it's a very durable product"" and it even won't fall off the keyboard."
5,I ordered this for my HP 15q-bu006tu after comparing the photos with my laptop keypad as this model was not mentioned in the supporting devices but I confirmed this will fits perfect with the HP 15q-bu006tu.
5,I bought it for my HP Laptop 15s-gr0010AU.It fits on the keypad like a skin .Had made my operations much easier and safe.It is a value product.Would definitely recommend it.
5,"It's perfect for my HP Notebook 15S DU0121TU Laptop, it looks like a new skin to my keyboard and matches perfectly with the dark screen ❤️"
4,"After 1 month writing this review. Product ìs good at this range.Good protection from dust for keys.Perfectly fit for keys.At some space less adhesive,but not a big problem.Mute key light is visible but capslock is not visible.Dont no where it is on or not.Overall satisfied."
5,"Wonderful product, exactly fits for HP Laptop - 15s-gr0007au. Thank you to seller SACO, also thank you AMAZON."
1,Is not suitable for HP ProBook G6 15.6 inch. The pad is bigger and the letters are not correct. There is no option for refund only exchange is available!
2,I am facing the problem of mismatch as shown in the picture. Is it problem with this unit i received or with all units of this type? Please see it carefully the white print on this skin mismatches with my hp da1074tx keyboard keys (red and white color light of both keys).  seller is not replying to this now.
5,Product fits exactly and its a must buy for HP 15 Bs145tu owners. And thanks to amazon for making this kinds of unique items availabe at reasonable cost and swift delivery.
4,adhesion issues hain.....baaki fitness accha hai......but keyboard lights will become completely useless
5,"A perfect fit. When placed, it doesn't look like a cover but it appears like the actual keys are black. (My laptop keys are silver). Gives a great look and also protects from dust filling in. Worth the purchase. 👍"

4,If You will compromise with your backlit keyboard then go for it .. the light didn't pass through the words .. order wise good cover for day use not for night.. light is only visible at the sides
1,"I bought this keyboard because it is the only mini keyboard I could find with:* Ctrl, Delete and Esc on the corners* Page Up/Down, Home, End on dedicated keys (not via an Fn key)As Farrah Macchiwalla already noted, the | and \ keys do not work normally (they generate < and >). Unfortunately I use them regularly so this defect is a show stopper.After two hours only the top bar of the Z key label was still there; the rest had rubbed off.  Hey, I hardly ever use that key!The keyboard has no adjustable feet and lies flatter than I like."
3,"I bought this to use with both my netbook and my tablet. Needed a compact keyboard but not too small for typing to be bad.In terms of form factor and durabilty this product is very good.Keys are firm and well spacedWire is decent length which is quite helpful if you need to work on desktopLooks are the only thing where the product is not that great but good functionality better okaying looksThere is no elevation option in this, so if that is a priority for you, then you wont get it here"
5,"Satisfies my main concerns, viz.1. Good key response2. Large backspace key3. Ctrl outside, Fn key inside4. Has dedicated Print Screen key5. Clearly separated Delete key (away from the arrow keys)6. Clearly separated arrow keys, although they're a bit small)7. Two Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys. Some keyboards only have one of one or more of them.One crib I have is that it doesn't have a right-click (context menu) key."
5,"Awesome 👍In my first impression, great gadget to have. My purpose was to be able to keep mouse on the table on the small table I have instead of buying bigger table. It solved my problem 100%. Ease of typing is good and it just matches my laptop keyboard size. Has the front elevation for angle but it is fixed. Overall quality is good and sturdy.It is made in China, it’s ok to buy folks."
5,"My computer table has a compact keyboard tray. Hence I could not fit my mouse along side the existing keyboard. This created a very irritating and uncomfortable working position with the mouse on the table top and keyboard below on the keyboard tray. Instead of buying a new computer table I bought this compact keyboard. It has solved my problem beautifully. It is compact, sturdy and has been working perfectly fine since I bought it 3 months ago. I absolutely do not miss my larger keyboard. This compact keyboard provides all the functionality in a smaller size and is ergonomically designed. Very comfortable and convenient to use. Great value for money. If you have limited space on your desk, this keyboard is perfect for you."
5,"This keyboard is a really helpful alternative for the default keyboard. Very useful for continuous typing and other purposes. The size is a bit smaller than the keyboard size of a 15"" laptop (as shown). Light weight and can be carried around easily. The key letterings and markings are printed real clear and stands out from the pitch black color of the product. Helpful for numpad users as it can be enabled by the click of a button that allows numbers to be typed just like the numpad (in the right side of the keyboard). There is no adjustable inclination adjustment, just a fixed inclination. For anyone who isn't looking for a costly one and an easily portable product, this is the real deal."
5,"Ppl who all thinks the Fn key is faulty (like I did and returned the product) pls be informed that there is a Number Lock button which toggles between default number keys or the letter keys. Use it. I only found after I purchase another keyboard and faced the same problem, but this time found my mistake. So I apologize for the faulty review..... Product is good."
1,"The package itself was tampered. Batteries were some old batteries (Eveready) which was already in the Mouse. apart from that, I got a Duracell OEM battery 1x AA & 1x AAA. Where the keyboard needs 2X AAA batteries.The keyboard is not new. It is some old keyboard which has some scratches behind it. I'm moving out of Amazon. Service is getting very unreliable. This has a huge impact on my work.Thank you!"
3,"It is a good option to go for at this price. The keys are reasonably soft. It is very light weight and sometime you feel it is too light weight. The feel is not great but OK, but at this price point we do not expect premium feel either. I feel the edges should have been a bit curved. Overall, this product is a good value for money and should take you through the basic needs for some time. Comes with 1 yr warranty and by that time you should have got your ROI !"
1,"It feels flimsy and loose. The keys are wobbly and makes noise when I just shake the keyboard. The print looked okay. The num,caps and scroll indicators are feeble. Worth a 200 maybe, not 500-Edit after a week, this is bad, its notbtue manufacturing, but the design. The keys are not sized and placed conveniently. Reducing from 3 to 1 star, wish I could get a refundEdit after 2 weeks- the shift key is getting stuck inside often."
5,"Been using this for a month now and i got to say no issues yet. i actually expected it to be a bit thinner but at this price range, i can't complain. There is decent key travel, certainly a bit more than standard laptop keyboards, which makes typing on this keyboard slightly more interesting than on a laptop keyboard. Very light weight, decent cable length, by default angled and no flipstand so not adjustable in that regard. Overall a very good product."
5,"My ThinkPad keyboard stopped working, I called local repair persons they changed keyboard and charged 2000 but after 7 months some keys stopped working I called them and replaced keyboard with 2100 again after 45 days new keyboard stopped working.Now i bought this keyboard it's good and working fine for me.Size is perfect what I was looking for."
4,"Excellent product, compact size, very useful if u have a less wider space for key board n for WFH, easy to travel, worth its price, very smooth key strokes, average noise while typing, availability of all keys, ergonomic design, accurate response. Only need is to get used to it. Would love more if lapcare brings a wireleass variant of this model"
2,"Pros:1. Compact and sleek design.2. Some buttons work as number keys after pressing num lock key.3. Comes with nice packaging and a hologram sticker which shows the originality of product from Lapcare.Cons:1. Some keys were mushy, squishy and they don't give the tactile feedback while typing. They hamper fast typing and might increase error rate.2. All keys were very loose and made noise when you shake the keyboard or even while typing. Which is annoying sometimes.3. The price is way too much according to the quality. It isn't worth Rs. 420."
5,"Light weight keyboard. Small form factor. Value for money. If your fingers are used to a macbook/macbook pro key layout, and you want something similar for the windows desktop to replicate the keystrokes muscle memory, this is an inexpensive alternative."
1,Worked so fine for exactly one month and now it stopped working. Not worth it. Pathetic experience. Have no backup keyboard working from home now!
5,I have purchased this Keypad on 23-Aug-2020. I feel the keys are soft and excellent like original dell keyboard. I had used mini keyboards similar to this over more than 2+ years and this keyboard is excellent. Supports Windows 10 Pro and lower versions with USB 2.0 as well.
4,"The typing experience is certainly not that great of a mechanical keyboard but it's not that bad for the price. I actually needed a fill-in keyboard as I am looking for something that I can use for gaming as well but this little keyboard is doing way beyond my expectations and that's the reason I decided to write this review.Build quality is average, it's light weight, the connecting wire could have been a little longer but irrespective of all the cons, it's a nice little keyboard that doesn't take much space, does the job and all the keys are working just fine, what more can you ask for such a cheapy price! :P :)"
2,"Image shown here might not be high resolution, search the model on lapcare website to check the keyboard layout with a bigger image.Pros:1. light and portable, exactly as shown.2. Keys makes very slight clincky noise but it is mostly quiet.3. The USB wire is also long enough.Cons:1. The keys are a little hard to press and if you hit a corner, it just doesn't press.2. The misplaced ""Insert"" button. As a linux console user, I use the insert/delete button to scroll on elinks browser, which is somewhat annoying with the ""insert"" key at the bottom. Anyways, this is still the most standard layout among other mini keyboard of this range."
4,Good for daily use. It is wired and no tension of batteries and bluetooth connection. The price is okay. I previously brought a white one. Now brought black. Actually I got a defective one but on replacement got another and is working good.
4,"Got the product today. Delivery is too late, it took 6 days to receive. Don't know the benefit of PRIME !Anyway product is fine, it comes with multimedia function.TUP--Number pad is with ""w,a,s,d,f..."" Keys. So turn of the ""NUMLOCK"" switch if u want to use alphabetical keyboard, otherwise it will show ""numbers"" instead of ""alphabet"""
4,"Be very clear when u r opting for a mini keyboard. It should fit into you laptop bag and shouldn't take up much desk space. That's it. And this keyboard serves it's purpose well. It's durable too - has fallen from my desk twice, & survived.Now, one thing u should know that it is a bit too mini. Yes its smaller than my ThinkPad keyboard. So I tend to do some typos as my fingers aren't yet adjusted to the closely placed keys."
5,The keyboard is exactly the size of my 15inch laptop's inbuilt keyboard. Keys are soft. Took me a day to get used to a new keyboard. Have been using it for more than a week now. I love it. Gives me more space for my mouse.
4,"Received the product 2 days ago. As of now the product is light and keys are smooth. Overall width is smaller than laptop keyboard. Nicely printed on the keys. I wish the height of the keyboard is higher. A permanent bulge is available Backside of keyboard, but height is not adjustable."
1,"at first, ib the photo it looks like it is wireless, after reading all reviews I bought it.after days I got to know it was wired.I already had a wired keyboard.I just wanted a small keyboard at least, it took a very long time to get delivered.after it came it looked nice, but when I started to type with it, it was very uncomfortable, it was a very bad experience using it. DISSAPOINTED"
4,"One of the keys is incorrectly programmed.  Fortunately it's not a key that's used often (PIPE | and BACK SLASH \).  Also, because of the placement of these keys, the left SHIFT key is smaller than usual so while typing, one tends to accidentally press that key rather than SHIFT."
4,All good. I don't know the command key was moved 1 key toward left for Mac. I wanted to check this out for my smaller computer table - before buying an expensive one and worked out well.
5,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality. Keypress requires minimal effort and the movement is shallow (which I like). If you normally like the kind of ""chicklet keyboards"" you get on laptops, you will like this keyboard. If you like mechanical keyboards with a long keypress and tactile feedback, then this is not for you."
5,Very nice product. It fits in dedicated space on my work table. Keys are very smooth & really enjoying while typing. Also registered online for extended warranty. Really ment for WFH. Thanks to Amazon for speedy delivery.
4,"The keys aren't of very good quality. The only reason I considered this purchase was because it was a small form factor, which I really needed, and it was affordable. It hasn't flaked out on me yet, which is a good thing."
5,The keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. Very compact so that I can keep my mouse along with the keyboard comfortably in the keyboard tray. The keyboard is of very good quality and typing is a breeze. The keys feel very good and I found it much better than the previous keyboard I had (Logitech K400R). The keys are raised and have good spacing in between. The tactile feel is also very nice. The keyboard does not have an adjustable rear feet for the right typing angle but instead has a fixed angle which I found to be quite useful.
1,Dont buy! Few keys on the keyboard stopped working and its of no use now! Waste of money.Better go with branded ones.
1,"The keyboard feels great but I ordered it twice and both have the same exact problem, when I press l or any other key it dosent registers l but numbers.Worst keyboard ever don't reccomend wasting your money"
5,Keys are smooth. For a compact tablet it s best just the width of laptop. No issues yet noted after 1 month use. No currupt keys or any malfunction.
5,"Buy this keyboard, handy, sleek, composed, strong material, mat finish. Almost a year, going great since.Increases the life of laptop by switching all typing to this sturdy keyboard"
4,I have smaller computer table where placing both keyboard and mouse getting difficult. So I order this. Quality seems reasonable but I feel it is too small for working long hours on it. It is slightly smaller than a 14 inch laptop keyboard.
1,ita function key isn't working. it is like its default ON. so the keys that are dependent on function key begin ON are working incorrectly.  For example button for 'p' prints '-'.please return this keyboard. its not usable
3,"I was very nice to use and worked well at first.. but after a month the keys started working differently.. for eg. if i press the key for ""p"" i got ""3' instead. so its kinds useless now."
4,"The form factor and durabilty of this product is very good. Keys are well spaced, soft &Wire is a decent length, lightweight. A very good option at this price. Overall, this product is a good value for money"
2,Not ergonomic. Hands rest away. Light weight but this is not a parameter for something which will lie on a table. Value for money if less than 500. Can't complain if i got it for cheap. But soend money and go for a good one.
5,Perfectly working with appropriate keys and perfect touch with every press of key.Great packing to avoid any damages during transit.Led light looking good.
5,Absolutely awesome keyboard. Excellent experience ❤❤Mechanical keys are so good 👌🏻👌🏻And very good packaging too 📦📦
5,"Ultimate look , quality of the product is awesome, perfect product for gaming."
5,"A very good accessory for people with long working hours on computers. Very comfy and I have felt the change within a week itself. I used to have pain on wrist and it would turn red while working before. But its not the case now and the cushion is very soft.The mat is also soft and mouse easily moves over it. Do not feel any lag or disturbance while using mouse.A value for money product.Note: Didn't used it for gaming, so gave 3 stars."
2,"I thought the foam wrist pad would be helpful, but it actually turned out to be the worst feature of this mouse pad. It causes stress and tiredness in the wrist. This was a total waste of money."
5,Tukzer Gel Mouse Pad Wrist Rest Memory-Foam Ergonomic Mousepad is only for those who have pain and cannot keep on using it on a flat surface. Thus this product Tukzer Gel Mouse Pad did a wonderful job of making my elders being able to use and drag the mouse from one corner to another.
5,I have been building pressure at my wrist due to constant usage of mouse and keyboard. This mouse pad gave good relief at the pressure points and feels very comfortable and soothing.
5,"As per its price, it offers the best comfort for wrist plus superior texture to the mouse for perfect functioning. I am using Razer Mamba gaming mouse over it, calibrated it to my style and the pad is offering the best to my needs.Sturdy and long lasting as well"
5,For the first few days you would be distracted by how soft and comfy it is till it gets a habit . You might not want to go back to a regular mouse pad after this. Not exactly for gamers but suited more to a less vigorous use .
2,"After looking at the product page and reading reviews, I ordered this item but I regret buying this. I experienced severe elbow pain while using this. May be it's about ergonomics or my arm anatomy but the pain was excruciating at the elbow joint. Ironically I felt more comfortable using my mouse on the table. Fortunately amazon support was helpful enough to raise a refund."
5,Good quality mouse pad. The memory foam support on the wrist is fine. Do nto forget to remove the sticker on the back before putting it on the table to stop pad from moving aroun while use.
5,"Just gonna say this that its like a pillow for your hand, it's comfortable but not too soft which is a good thing.. it is wide enough to give you support even when you are working and are constantly changing your hand position. For me it's a very nice purchase, it's worth the money..."
5,The material is of good quality and memory foam does it's job well. I had mouse hand pain so I review many mouse pads and choose this one.Size is good to work on and it comfort my hand too.Conclusion is this deal is value for money.
5,Products is very comfortable to use and palm support works well. Ot will absorb uour palm pressure and heat during your working hours. The design and quality looks fine for me. The only problem i notice is the bottom part is very sticky and it will dust very fast
5,"High quality product. Has an anti slip grip which prevents the pad from moving. The gel pad on which the wrist rests is not to soft or hard, it is adequate. I wish the width of the pad was a little less."
5,Matching color for my daughters desk.Suitable for work from home and school kids with online classes
5,Go for it!
3,"Very good grip and comfortable to the palm and wrist. But the grip was time being, after 2 months the grip has gone and now its a mouse pad which need adjustment time to time. Overall its a good product but the grip needs more some treatment for long lasting hope upcoming version have good grip."
5,"First I was confused whether to buy or not but after reading the valuable reviews, I bought it. After using more than a month, I found it really comfortable, soft and good quality for the price.. Thank you!"
5,The gel pad actually works and the product is of premium quality.
5,Very comfortable for the wrist. Ordered it for my mother (she is a teacher and has to use her laptop for long hours). She loves it.
5,"Smooth and comfortable to use.. doesn't move once placed. Good quality, worth the purchase!"
5,The product is good quality. The gel pad to rest the hand is comfortable and gives a good grip. Might take a day or two for people who haven’t used this before. Overall worth the money. Writing review after a month of purchase.
5,Worth Every single pennySize is bestGreat qualityFeels premiumDesign as shown in imageVery great printAll n all 5 out of 5
3,"Quality of the product is good, but the wrist resting pad is bit hard (it's my personal opinion might be different from other users).Otherwise it's good and seems durable."
5,"Good built quality, comfy pad, anti slip mat sticks to the surface like glue or something, quite good area for the mouse movement. Highly recommended."

5,It's nice minimal design mouse pad with comfortable wrist rest design.
5,Its a great product to buy. Worth the money
5,Good purchase
1,The foam installed to rest the wrist was very thick and uncomfortable. I don't know how other people are giving it five stars.

5,Bought this for work and it’s one of the best things on my desk! Love this! Super comfortable and it looks good on my desk! So happy I ordered this! 👍
5,- So far I am happy with this mouse pad.- It provides a better support for my arm and very comfortable to use.- No seat while using and keeping the contact dry.Would recommend for this price
5,Super soft and comfortable and a great addition to laptop or keyboard as a hand rest for your palms. Thanks Amazon
5,Recommended to get over wrist pain due to normal mouse usage.
5,Perfect mouse pad. Don't go for cheap ones.. this one is the best.
5,Good product quite heavy and stable. It is not flimsy. It has very strong non slip effect. I am ordering a second one.
5,Best in quality n performanceMust buy!
5,I love this product... So comfort while using office work 💞 I m luving it💖🥰
1,"The wrist pad is too firm, and it's not memory foam"
5,"Comfort, Quality and Price at its best.Also best gift for your loved ones in need."
4,"This keyboard is a little annoying to use. The box says quiet typing but it is not like that. The sounds of the key is a little higher than you’d expect but however, it varies from person to person. The mouse is good for small hands but for medium or huge it is a problem. Also the length of the wire for the USB is small and you may find it irritating. But I needed it for sometime. If you don’t have any problems with the things mentioned above, then this is a good product considering the price."
2,product is not so much good... but regarding the price it is good for some time use... for normal it is okay... but if you want to game then please with mechanical keyboard...this time I have not so much budget so I bought it for some time use... later I will buy a good mechanical keyboard and a wireless mouse
2,"You get what you pay for. Quality is satisfactory as per the pricing. Good for those who are looking for a temporary and less priced keyboard mouse. For longer usage and durability, I'd recommend other."
4,"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's as good as any other brand. I've used HP, Dell and Amazon basic over the years. Yes, their finishing is better but when it comes to the use this is as good as any of these brands. It's cheaper and serves the purpose. Definitely worth your money."
5,"Stylish, Value for money. If you are looking for a good keyboard / mouse at reasonable cost, this is the one. Works well for home office / kids online classes."
1,I am writing this review after 3 months of use.High precesion Mouse start doing malfunction.On single click it is performing double click operation.Keyboard keys are not smooth now.

3,"keyboard for good for average purposes but the mouse was worthless , it stopped working in a few days..... u can buy this just for the keyboard, buy another mouse"
4,Average product.Keyboard is good.But mouse is below average.
1,Waste of money. One key 'N' is not working properly. Second inferior response time.Don't buy it. It is my suggestion.

1,after 1 month keyboard and mouse did not work.
4,"keyboard quality is good at this price point, but the mouse is not that good. If you find the deal around 400 then only buy it. Good for tight budget peoples."
4,"This keyboard is a little annoying to use. The box says quiet typing but it is not like that. The sounds of the key is a little higher than you’d expect but however, it varies from person to person. The mouse is good for small hands but for medium or huge it is a problem. Also the length of the wire for the USB is small and you may find it irritating. But I needed it for sometime. If you don’t have any problems with the things mentioned above, then this is a good product considering the price."
2,product is not so much good... but regarding the price it is good for some time use... for normal it is okay... but if you want to game then please with mechanical keyboard...this time I have not so much budget so I bought it for some time use... later I will buy a good mechanical keyboard and a wireless mouse
2,"You get what you pay for. Quality is satisfactory as per the pricing. Good for those who are looking for a temporary and less priced keyboard mouse. For longer usage and durability, I'd recommend other."
4,"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's as good as any other brand. I've used HP, Dell and Amazon basic over the years. Yes, their finishing is better but when it comes to the use this is as good as any of these brands. It's cheaper and serves the purpose. Definitely worth your money."
5,"Stylish, Value for money. If you are looking for a good keyboard / mouse at reasonable cost, this is the one. Works well for home office / kids online classes."

4,"The following is my review of the Logitech MK 345 Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This product is a combo which means it comes with a Wireless Keyboard and Wireless mouse.Before i get into the review here are the contents in the box:-1)One wireless Keyboard with 2 built in  AAA Duracell Alkaline batteries.2)One wireless Mouse with 1 built in AA Duracell Alkaline Battery.3)One USB receiver for connecting the keyboard and mouse to a Desktop or Laptop4)Warranty paperwork &5)User ManualThe Keyboard is a Logitech K 345 wireless keyboard.It works on the 2.4ghz wireless band.(The same band used by Wi Fi N routers).The keyboard is black in color and the keys are predominantly black in color with a few blue accents on the 12 function keys.The underside of this keyboard is blue in color.It is a full size desktop keyboard with 12 function keys on top as well as numeric keys at the side.It has an on/off switch on the top right side of the keyboard.It comes with a palm rest on the bottom to rest your palm while typing.It comes with 2 AAA Duracell Alkaline batteries built in and logitech claim that these will last for 48 months or 4 years.However,i have yet to test this claim.The operating range of this keyboard is about 10m.It has auto standby which means that the keyboard will go into a low power state automatically when not in use to preserve the battery  and you don't need to worry about draining the battery incase you forget to switch it off.The mouse included is a Logitech M 275 wireless mouse which also operates on the 2.4 ghz wireless band.It is a standard size mouse which could be used comfortably with people with small,medium and large sized hands.It is black in color on the top and blue on the underside.It is an optical mouse with 1000 Dpi (Dots Per Inch) resolution.It has an invisible optical sensor which means that the laser beam emmited from the sensor on the bottom of the mouse cannot be seen with the naked eye unlike the sensors on other optical mice which emit a red laser beam from the sensor on the bottom.It has a left and right click button as well as a scroll wheel in the center which can also be pressed like a button.It comes with a single AA Duracell alkaline battery built in and logitech claims that this battery will work for 18 months based on 8 hrs a day usage.It also has an on/off button at the bottom and this also features auto standby.The operating range for this mouse is about 10 m.The only flaw i feel this combo has personally is that the USB adapter which comes with it is not a unifying one which means that it is paired exclusively with the mouse and keyboard it comes with and if you lose the adapter the combo becomes useless as you cannot buy a spare one from the store and use it with your particular combo.You will have to buy a new combo altogether.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall it's a good product for office and home use as well as some light gaming as well.All in all it's a pretty decent combo for all it's worth and if you can overlook this one flaw it's a good buy.I hope this info was helpful to you.Thank you for reading my review."
4,"Its Being a Long time since i wrote my last review , hope i still cover all the basic points and finally the real issues that everybody misses...First of all my old DELL wireless keyboard stopped working so i brought this one , it had some battery issue otherwise was working fine for the last two yearsI consider this a BASIC or starter wireless keyboard and mouse, and I am reviewing it IN THAT CONTEXT (even though there are a couple of Logitech wireless combos that are below this one). In that regard, it is quite good.Right from the outset I was very impressed with it's no-hassle plug and play aspect. I literally removed it from the box (batteries came already installed), plugged the tiny nano-receiver into a USB port on the old laptop that I happened to have handy at the time and both the keyboard and mouse were recognized and responsive in under 30 seconds. From box to working in a minute or two. That is probably record time for any computer accessory that I've ever installed.➤'TIP: While this is plug-and-play and works perfectly without installing any drivers or software, you can get some added functionality if you install Logitech's Setpoint software. I have provided the link for it on the bottom of this review.'➤IMPORTANT NOTE: Many people comment that the mouse is small. This is partially an ILLUSION due to the SHAPE of the mouse, which is a bit different from others. If you see my comparison photos, you will see that it is not much smaller than other mice.I used two standard size mice and one very small travel mouse for comparison. Some people have also commented on the light weight of the mouse. This is actually true as it is in fact relatively light:Here are my weight comparisons (without/with batteries):Included Mouse (M275)-63g/86g VX Revolution (M-RBU126)- 83g/110g Marathon (M705)-87g/135gVX Nano (M-RC134)-73/95gFIRST IMPRESSION (Overall): Both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly light. There is protective plastic on the keyboard which once removed reveals an attractive glossy surface around the key portion of it. The palm rest has a flat rather than glossy finish and has small indentations which give it some very subtle texture. The mouse has a very narrow wraparound glossy collar (also covered with protective plastic). The sides (indentation for thumb and opposite side) have the same flat sheen and textured design as on the keyboard's palm-rest. The result is a sort of two-toned black on black look. Aesthetically, the mouse and keyboard co-ordinate very well.MOUSE: This is quite obviously a right-handed mouse. Some might consider the mouse to be on the SMALLER side. This is really a MATTER OF PREFERENCE and as I already noted, this is largely an illusion. I have used both larger and smaller mice and sometimes it is just a matter of what you are accustomed to. I usually prefer the smaller mice because they seem easier to maneuver around with subtle finger movements. It has an overall ergonomic shape that feels pretty comfortable and natural in my own medium-sized hand. I can understand those with bigger hands preferring something a little more substantial. This is a great mouse to use with a laptop (or as a dual-use travel/stationary mouse), especially since it works with the nano receiver and has the small look.This is a no-frills mouse. It has the basic left and right click button and wheel. It does not have any extra buttons that you find on some other mice that are usually programmed to move forwards or backwards through web pages, zoom, etc. The wheel does have a push button. When depressed, it puts the mouse into a 4-way scroll mode, that is you can scroll in four directions around a page by moving the mouse as you would normally move the cursor. Depress again to return to cursor control. It is made of a rubber-like material which gives it a nice feel.The mouse seems responsive and I have not had any issues with losing connectivity so far.KEYBOARD: Normal full-sized keyboard. There is an on/off switch and an LED Caps Lock indicator. The ""Function"" and ""Control"" keys might be a little larger than on other keyboards (especially the Function key) and it seems like the space bar was made a little smaller to accommodate this. I have not found it to be a problem for me, but felt I should note it any way. There are the typical flip-out feet to set the keyboard on an angle. The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has ""Advanced energy-efficient design"" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.Packaging : When i opened the plastic wrap than immediately the USB connector fell out i was a bit surprised as the whole box was not even opened yet , then i found that the whole box was badly torn and a hole was there where it came off , as we all know that connector is the main thing without it its useless and the hassle of invalid return because of missing items i would suggest the seller or amazon to better take care of this issue and hope no one else faces it againIN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.I have provided a few pictures below hope they help in making your choice...Questions/Comments welcome."
2,"The mouse double stopped working after a couple of months use, I bought a new mouse M235 but again I was unable to unify with this product's with the receiver since there is no unifying feature in the keyboard. I was expecting the life of this product to last around 2 to 3 years but the mouse stopped working so early which is very disappointing. I believe they should include the unifying feature to this product as well."
1,"Some keys are not functioning properly after few days of use -- they get stuck in the middle when pressing. The major issue is the random automatic clicks and text/item selections that happen without touching the mouse or keyboard at all! I ensured that there are no interfering WiFi or other devices located nearby, but still the issue of mouse generating random clicks and selecting items on its own persists. I have tried using different surfaces to place the mouse as well, but the issue persists. Not happy at all with this product -- didn't expect this quality from Logitech."
3,"Not for gaming or any such thing. The keyboard layout is for day to day use. While the keys have a pressing depth which is very good for fast typing, the key surface seems a bit squeezed and smaller horizontally. Never seen that before on a keyboard. The mouse is contoured and a tad small- but does its job. The overall feel of the product is very tacky, light and cheap. Still can be ignored as the typing experience is better. A not so good feature is the hotkeys like browser launch, volume etc don't act on pressing, till you press FN+  desired hotkey. EXtra work.What I didn't like is the seller first sent me a keyboard which had some defect in some keys not working. That was JUne 2019. I asked and got prompt replacement- Only to travelling till Diwali. Today  I broke the seal and though all seemed good- the USB connector that is kept inside the mouse was missing. As return window was closed to due my delay in inspecting- I am now left with a set having no connector- I pulled out the old connector which is working. Seller didn't inspect and sent a pack with missing parts. Not nice I didn't check on receipt. Never happened before with Amazon. Lesson learnt. Poor service."
2,"Great Keyboard and Mouse Combo. Have been using it about a month now and the battery indicators are still showing as good. Sometimes i even forget to turn off the keyboard and mouse but it hasn't affected the battery life.Update: 17/03/2016: I had to downgrade the rating on this product as after about 6 months (it failed at some point in February) of use some of the keys on the keyboard have stopped functioning. I will be contacting Logitech to claim under the warranty, but I expected better from a company like Logitech. The mouse is working just fine. Disappointed with the keyboard issue though. Lowering the rating of this product to 2 till the matter is resolved. Will update soon!"
5,I just love it.  Feeling to work more using this keyboard.  As usual Amazons amazing deal price of 1700 is another attraction.  My experience after two days of usage.1. Trendy look and dual color.  Bottom blue and media function keys.2. Duracell batteries.3. Smooth keys and mouse movements.4. Plug and play.  Just hassle free starting.5. Light weight keyboard.  I feel a bit heavy mouse due to battery in it but later realized that it sits nicely in the hand.6. Apt setup for office and business usage.
1,"This is my review after using this kb mouse combo for over a period of 6 months.Kb is still good. Keys are spaced out exactly like how I want.But, the mouse is pathetic. It was good for 3 months and gradually it came to a point where click does not get registered at all first time and it becomes pain to do operations like drag and drop. Replacing the batteries also did not help.So, my recommendation is to avoid this combo only because of the pathetic mouse quality"
4,"It may easily be the best Wireless Keyboard Mouse combo available in this range. I'm writing this review after two years of continuous and extended usage. I have used it for a little bit of gaming and doing work (design work) involving a lot of usage of the mouse. Agreed it may not be the tool for actual professionals but it has held good for these 2 years. The keyboard buttons are nice to press and type and the buttons haven't gone hard or unresponsive yet. That extended area to keep the palm is really nice. The media and shortcuts buttons multiplexed with the Function keys are really handy. The arrow keys are decently spaced from other keys and the seperate Num pad is another plus. There is also a light to indicate caps lock. Would have been nice if they included one for Num lock too.Now about the mouse. It is well suited for right hand use and designed with that in mind. It fits well in the left hand too. Now the problem with the mouse is something that is common with many of the Logitech mouses. The left button got dodgy in 6 months. It was a hit or miss which was really frustrating and hindered my work. Now the solution to that is opening the microswitch for the left mouse button and bending the springy contact inside so that it clicks nicely. It has been holding so good after I did that. It would have been a perfect device if not for that silly microswitch which is surprisingly made by a well known brand.I have been using this combo for my laptop and I am yet to change the Duracell batteries that came in the box. I'm quiet surprised by it's performance and battery usage. It still looks cool after so much usage. The gloss on the keyboard will certainly get scratched, but still looking fine nonetheless."
4,"Mice:- Overall a good product for day to day use.Pos: I already own M221 Mice since my dell combo's mice started recognising double clicks and the scroll wheel stopped working, compared to both dell mice and M221 this one comes in between in case weight, while the former one is the heaviest and later one being the most silent.It has green led to let you know the status of battery and when its turned on the green led stays on for quite a bit.Cons: At this price the mice should come with silent technology, for God's sake this combo costs Rs1800 this is the least we can ask for, the clicking sound is irritating after using M221.Not as accurate as it should be, downside of being 1000dpi but even my dell mouse was more accurate than bith M221 and this mice.Keyboard:- Really good keyboard, better than my dell's keyboard, it keys make a really good clicking sound which I love to hear and they even look good.Pros: On/Off button to switch it on/off to save battery power.Logitech's devices are known for its battery life and adding to this the switch will help you to extend the battery life.Good color scheme blue and black looks really sporty and attractive.LED indicator for caps lock which makes life that much easier.Good and broad wrist support is provided makes it easy to use for long sessions of working.Cons: LED indicator for num lock is missing, would be appreciated if company had provided indicator.Keys are relatively small than my dell's keyboard and well its a bit hard to get used to it, maybe I am nitpicking here.No hotkey function provided to increase or decrease brightness, maybe they made it thinking it will be used with desktops only but well even laptop users need external combos logitech.A reall large size function key is provided on the right side which is bigger than all other keys around it, instead a 2 small function keys on both side would have been more helpful, well every device has some shortcomings.NOTE: I bought this combo for my laptop and the connector shown in other reviews mentioned it being the size of a pendrive whereas mine is really small as shown in the pictures. I appreciate the fact that logitech updated it as a big connector would have added to the task of removal everytime I had to carry my laptop with me in bag. This is plugged in and its as it is since I have plugged it in the laptop.Duracell batteries are provided, maybe the claim of long battery life will be fulfilled as duracell batteries are really good, lets see.Will update on durability and battery life after few months use, until then take care you all.If you have any doubt feel free to ask."
4,"The keyboard and mouse work all right. Range is decent as long as there is line of sight to the receiver. It refused to connect after a few days, which turned out to be the fault of the USB extension I had purchased to get the receiver in line of sight.I expect battery life will be fantastic like all other Logitech wireless products I use - I need to wonder why they stop working once every few years, then realise I might need batteries. Like all others, I expect the middle mouse button to stop working after six months. I use it a lot to open new tabs on browsers, and it wears them out.The keys feel good. They are fairly silent but not as much as the chiclet types on the K400. They definitely feel better than the G100, which was horrible to start with and then just got worse over time. Mouse is a little small. I only have 7"" palms and on that it feels small, though not as tiny as the M235 which I have two of. The sculpted shape makes it feel smaller than it is, if it was ambidextrous it would have probably felt a bit chunkier.All in all it's pretty good. I also have another wireless unit that i use on another machine, this was a step up. I'm taking one star off for the lack of multimedia keys, which are critical when trying to control a TV from 10 feet away, and the volume icon is just too small. The Fn functions do work, but in the dark they're almost impossible to see."
3,"OK for the price. I also use couple of mechanical keyboards. This is nowhere near to that typing quality. None the less considering price, the quality is OK. It is fine in you type now and then and in small lengths at a time. But if you type a lot, these are definitely not good. Mouse is of reasonable quality."
1,LATEST REVIEW AFTER USING FOR 6 MONTHS:The key board has lost it’s original feel. The keys are becoming tight and are VERY NOISY. Typing sound distracts my nearby colleagues and also interferes with audio when on conference calls. So it is almost impossible to type when you’re on a call without muting the laptop/headphone. The mouse is really good and continues to perform well. Overall response time for both keyboard and mouse are fantastic.OLD REVIEW 1 WEEK AFTER PURCHASE:Been using it for a week now. Both the mouse and keyboard have a pleasant tactical feel and are easy to use as they’re very responsive. Typing especially is stress free. Both have a compact and ergonomic design. Only fault I see so far is that the keyboard height raisers are not robust. So I’m a little careful when I deploy or fold them back
3,"Its very good when I bought it, but from last 7 days, am seeing following problems.1. Delay in typing2. Keyboard not responding for a while3. Mouse pointer not moving unless i turn off and on4. Mouse pointer not moving as we move itDidn't expected this from logitech device after spending 2.3k, better to buy hp or dell or any lower price item instead of feeling guilty of buying this."
5,"Pros:1. Fast Plug and play: be it Windows or Linux, you just need to plug in the dongle and your keyboard/mouse will be working within 2 seconds.2. Full-size keyboard with dedicated numpad and function keys.3. Very durable: I've dropped the mouse more times than I'd like to admit and it hasn't broken.4. Long battery life: Been almost a year and I still haven't needed to change the batteries that came with it.5. On/off switches: they're present on both the devices so you can conserve the battery life.6. Reliability: never faced any drop in connection with either the mouse or the keyboardCons:1. No extra buttons on the mouse: just the standard left, middle and right click.2. Bottom surface of the mouse is a dust and lint magnet. I have to clean it every month.3. Mouse is on the smaller side. If you have big hands this might be a problem.4. Lack of Menu key: they made the function button really big so there's no dedicated menu key. Pressing Fn+Right Ctrl does the same thing though."
4,Logitech MK345 Wireless Combo  is known for its PC accessories. This one keyboard is full blown one and its best for the office use and its keyboard is also very sturdy.Mouse at sometime we may feel the palm pain. may be need to get used to this mouse with the rite posture. But if you are looking for full keyboard and mouse wireless one . This is the best one .Also has the Power on and off on both the keyboard and mouse. Its really usefull to save the battery power when not in use.So far not used for Gaming yet. Let me try and see how it works :)But the price of the product varies a lot on different places
5,"I was using K400 earlier for the past 3 to 4 years and I remember to have changed battery only once. Its keyboard was struck due to long exposure of dust. This is the point where I  brought Logitech again, this time MK345. In contrast with the previous version, MK 345 is a full length keyboard and rugged. Its built quality is strong and key presses are tactile unlike K400. Palm rest is comfortable and I feel full in control when I type and sit in front of the computer. Mouse too is handy and good for small to medium hand size. Installation is very simple and Windows recognizes immediately as soon as it boots. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend for anyone who use computer heavily."
1,"This is the worst experience I have ever got by purchasing any product through Amazon. I purchased it in the month of March, 2018. The keyboard was not functional in the month of September, 2018. Then I claimed warranty and got a new keyboard+ mouse combo. This new combo is not working properly right now. Some keys in the keyboard are automatically pressed ( for eg. in my case cntrl button). I have replaced the batteries also. But cannot get rid of it. The mouse is OK. But the keyboard is not working properly. This same problem is occurred more than one times in two different sets. Now, I am not in the warranty period. So, I cannot replace it. After investing more than 2000 rupees, if you get problems frequently within and after the warranty period, then what will you expect from this product? So from my point of view, this is only wastage of money.I purchased another keyboard+mouse combo from Logitech whose price was near about 1160 rupees (I forgot and that product was ordered from my friend's account). I got the same problem in that combo also. I replaced that combo two times. But after warranty period, I had no option instead of purchasing another keyboard.So, my overall experience to the Logithech keyboard+mouse combo is very bad. If you want suggestion from me, then it will be better for you to either use wireless combo of another company or use wired keyboard and mouse."
3,"What I didn't like is the palm rest advertised. In the picture if you look you will think it is great, but when you have the product, you realise that the width of the support is not at all sufficient. Moreover, the function keys are sleek and so you need to be careful while using them. Another flaw is the home key. In all the keyboards I have used so far they were all in the same place of the standard layout, but this one has insert key there which is very annoying when you try to combine with shift key for copying something.The mouse that comes along with it is excellent.So buy it only for a discounted price (anywhere below 1900/- inr)"
5,"It's the right size for medium size hands. The battery life is supposedly great - yet to test it out, but with my history Logitech products, they usually last forever battery-wise.The materials are all plastic and nothing premium feeling, but that's expected for the price (I got it for around Rs 2100 for the mouse + keyboard in May 2020).5 stars for doing what it's supposed to do!"
5,"Extremely good keyboard, the battery life is good, the keyboard buttons are all placed so ergonomically that will not feel any fatigue even after long hours of typing, moreover, this keyboard is extremely sturdy just its USB Keyboard counterpart such as TVSE Gold, and aesthetically extremely good to look at. I have been using this for around a year, and am extremely satisfied, it looks sturdy, is extremely responsive, is compatible with Windows, Linux or Ubuntu laptops as well as desktops, I have used them on all of these. And I must thank Amazon for prompt delivery."
5,"Hi,As a fulltime software Dev, I was having eye & neck pain due to wrong posture and screen too near. So coupled with lappy stand, this keyboard helps me a lot.*Pro Tip:* The wrist/palm rest works best with 7degree keyboard legs open.It felt uncomfortable & the keys looked small plus mouse gave me a nasty wrist pain at first  & for 2 days I was cursing both mouse & keyboard.But after using for few days, when I got habituated. I really loved them both.They are truly ergonomic according to me.-:Shubham Shree,  NIT Trichy CSE Grad"
5,"Was a skeptic of wireless keyboard's and mouse for a long time, but this beauty makes a convincing case for all those who are in the skeptic boat. It was a breeze to setup , just plug in the receiver and it starts working as expected. the palm rest at the end of the keyboard is a rarity these days and is much appreciated. The plastic seems durable, and the keys give a good amount of feedback though they do take some time to get used to. Only the elite programmer will be disappointed i feel :)Mouse has a shape that is unconventional and yet is comfortable to hold.Combo comes with the duracell cell's and i hope they last a long time, as proclaimed.P.S- Registering my product by making an account on Logitech india website, confirms the prduct warranty to be of 1 year duration from date of purchase.[ attached the amazon invoice, and typed in the serial number found near battery compartments of keyboard/mouse.]"
4,"Using the keyboard with a Ubuntu and MacBook pro.Experience with Ubuntu laptop has been great and almost flawless. I connect to windows virtual machine and the keyboard shortcuts worked great for them. Felt as if directly working with windows machine. So this has become the defacto combination to use for long hours of work.Experience with the Mac Book has not been that great. It works ok for regular keys. But as might be the case with other keyboards as well, the windows specific keys do not work, or at least I have not had the patience to figure out to get them to work. Couple of times, the keyboard stop functioning. I had to pull out the usb reciever and plug it back in to get it to work again. After couple of such instances within a day, I have totally kept the keyboard away from the using with Mac. Might try it out a few days later when previous frustrating experience fades.I ordered this one looking at some space for palm rest. The size looks small given my hand size. It is still better than not having anything at all.The mouse is decent although again felt a little small. The shape is comfortable to use for right handed user.Months of Mac usage had probably got me used to a little wider spacing of the keys. I felt my fingers getting little cramped when typing on day one. After couple days of use, feel like the fingers have adjusted and typing has been more comfortable."
1,For Seller:1. The packing was awful. The box was torn and the keyboard was sticking out.Few points on Keyboard:1. The keys are too hard and are uncomfortable. I have used mechanical keyboards and they are not this hard to type.2. The palm rest is of no use as they are very small. You cannot rest your palm on it. Dell keyboards with palm rests are better.3. On switch on the keyboard does not work. The keyboard works whether the switch is on or off. I cannot switch the keyboard off.Few points on Mouse:1. The built quality is not very assuring. The plastic used is of inferior quality.2. Clicks on the mouse are clumsy and do not assure any confidence.3. The cursor jump when you use it.4. Tracking is not good.5. The size of the mouse is too small.Pros:1. Easy plug and play.2. Batteries included.3. Wireless receiver is small.
1,"After 3 months use, i can definitely say its not worth it. The typing is horrid. The letters wont pop up, and sometimes when u type 1 letter, around 4/5 pops up. At first i thot it was the battery, i changed to a brand new then i also thot it might be the bluetooth range... Now the bluetooth is only a few inches away from the keyboard but still useless. No problem with the mouse though. 2 stars is for the price and mouse.Edited: Mouse also stopped working. Just a crap. Threw them both away. And i cant find Minus Star."
4,"They keys are tall keys that give crunchy sound. Thia brings back a lot of memo, but having been used to laptop soft keys, the noise making ones aren't always friendly especially during calls in a work from home environment. If you like the crunchy keys, this is the one for you. One of the main disadvantages of this keyboard is that the letters are mere stickers which is not a great thing at this price point.Mouse is a nice and solid one with a good battery life. It is also ergonomically nice to hold for a mid sized palm."
2,"The good: Comfortable to use, the keyboard battery has lasted for more than an year now without needing to change. The product comes with Duracell batteries.The bad: The Bluetooth USB transceiver is very bad (saying this as a logitech customer as I know they make better quality ones), it needs to be within a few centimeters with direct line of sight for it to work without connectivity issues. My solution was to purchase a USB3 extension cable and bring it from my laptop's USB port to near the keyboard. This is little better than a wired keyboard. To drive my point home I'm using my older Logitech MX anywhere 2 mouse with its own BT-USB transceiver and it works perfectly without any extension from the same USB ports on my laptop. No interference whatsoever, granted this is a more premium product you might be guessing why I wasn't using this in the first place, it's because its inbuilt battery lasts less than a week under heavy use. Has been like that since day 1.The ugly: Mouse failed in about an year, it was around the 1 year mark and I was busy otherwise so couldn't check if the warranty was applicable. I never abused the mouse or even travelled with it, it just failed one day.Overall: I'm pissed at Logitech, every single product of theirs I've purchased in the last half decade have had some issues, minor or otherwise. The bean counters are slowly destroying what used to be a good company. Rinse, cycle, repeat, time to look elsewhere."
4,"18-Jan , purchased. Good product.21-Oct , After 10 months from purchasing mouse scroll wheel stopped working. Contacted support and service, they gave a plan to upgrade windows , inter chipset, bluetooth and wirless driver. This is happening in 2020.16-Dec , Received a Replacement Product today. Luckly i was under one year warranty.Recommend not to invest in fancy high tech keyboard and mouse. Mid series are fine. I got K220 as a replacement for a short time , it is a good choice though looks cheap but serves the purpose."
2,"This product I bought as I thought that logitech would make reliable stuff. The mouse broke down 6 months down the line. (First time this happened to me) Click and drag stopped working, so selecting texts etc was bad. Went to logitech center as still in warranty and got replacement in 3 weeks. Now after 9 months the mouse again gave up. I guess I am out of warranty as this was covered for 1 year.That is beside the point. the  mouse should not have gone kaput in so little time.Maybe will buy unbranded cheap products . They might also last as much or longer"
5,"Writing detailed review after 2 months of office use.Pros -- Keyboard & mouse are convenient to use and are very responsive since they use the Logitech's USB Nano receiver.- Mouse is sized perfectly. It's not small as it looks in the pictures due to its right-handed use shape.- Batteries will last long ( 3 yrs for keyboard and 1.5 yrs for mouse)Cons -- Bit pricey at 1900 Rs but worth investing if you want a trustworthy wireless solution.- At this price I was expecting better quality key presses.- Key caps are bit wiggly and often resist the key-press if pressed with a slight angle.I needed a keyboard & mouse for office use and had to research a lot. I even returned 2 keyboards before this final purchase. My requirements were.1. Standard layout.2. Quiet, unlike my loud mechanical keyboard in home that I love but is very clicky.3. Wireless, because i need to take my laptop to meeting rooms & presentations quite often.4. Good quality keys.5. Ergonomic design.6. Not too expensive as it will be kept in office.It fulfilled all my requirements. I love this wireless solution. I keep the USB Nano receiver plugged in my laptop all the time so that I don't loose it and it's barely noticeable since it's very small. Everyday before leaving office I just switch off both mouse & keyboard to save some battery but even if you don't, this battery should last more than a year.Conclusion:This keyboard cannot be my main programming keyboard because I love my cherry MX brown cooler master mechanical keyboard.But for my office use nothing beats this Logitech MK345."
5,"This keyboard is no doubt ergonomically designed but i found it hard to use the spacebar.. i have used other keyboards no issues with my typing but here the spacebar until you press centrally doesn't work hence get typing errors, otherwise the keys are smooth and works noiseless. Feel sturdy. The mouse is great invisible laser and sensitive. Buttons are soft fellow delicate but not the delicate i think no problem as such. Not much a gaming persons so no comment."
3,"The palm rest on the keyboard is too small and useless, unless you've tiny hands. Only my thumb rests on the palm rest, not my palm, and I don't have huge hands.Function keys are packed together. Have to look at the keyboard each time you want to change the volume. A minor inconvenience during gaming.I use a G300S for claw grip. And this mouse is about 2/3rd the size of that. Will be uncomfortable for long gaming sessionsMouse has no DPI modifier. Might be better off buying a cheaper one from a local brand"
1,Dont buy renewed item. amazon not verified any renewed product before delivery.i received a damage product.
5,"No problem with the refurb till date. My first refurb purchase, but still holding strong."
5,"Thank you Amazon for providing almost 'new keyboard' with this Refurbished deal. I normally do not put reviews of the product, but, I am absolutely delighted hence this review! Super smooth keys and ease of use."
4,I am happy with this amazing RGB keyboard. This is such a beautiful product. It makes me smile when I'm using this keyboard. Overall it is best for those working at night time or in low light.
5,I have been using this keyboard for some past months! And i feel that this keyboard can be a good option in budget Rgb keyboard list! Thought i faced certain difficulties with using multiple keys simultaneously while playing! Not sure if the keyboard is a gaming centric keyboard or not!
1,Never buy renewed  products  from Amazon...Many key do not work
5,Just what I needed for my second PC. Looks great and works really well.
1,"Not recommended M key stops working, number keys press single digit number showing two digits ( when u press 4 in notepad shows 47). First its feels like new then after a month colors strated wearing off."
4,basically this product is good for gamint but i thnk the horizontal number line could get more brighter. and the height adjucement should be in proper manner it is one side up and one down
5,Supab Quality.
5,The keyboard is awesome it is lighting and gaming keyboard very comfortable and best in look. The delivery was super fast it delivered in two days!
5,Super Best item im the world ever I have seen 😀😀😀😀😀
5,"(Full deep review, Everything is covered in this review)Works like a pebble,Feels like a pebble,Glides like a pebble,Priced like a pebble.This pebble shaped mouse is the best for it's price.First you get the mouse itself, battery included, adapter and the instructions how to pair and mode switching.Second it glides on the laminated or smooth surface, user hold your pebble.Third pairing is easy for the first time then to connect to other device by Bluetooth just hold the button, it will blink.For adapter connect to non Bluetooth device, click on the button and light turns green. Easy as a pebble does.AND you can use this mouse for both different system just in a click of a button.BIGGEST THING you can carry on your pocket it is flat as a pebble, so more portable than normal mouse, because it is a pebble.SECOND BIGGEST THING is it doesn't make any noise, even the button and the school wheel makes virtually no sound. What buttons or sorcery they use but definitely for a smooth experience.It is not a red light optical mouse ,It is a infrared led mouse to get that gaming mouse feel when playing games."
5,Have had a MK331 silent mouse for a while. Bought this for work reading about the 100gm unbelievable weight. And the super silent clicks. Not let down one bit. This is a real beauty to hold and use. And best part is the mouse works with either the receiver or Bluetooth built into your pc. Has a toggle below to switch between the two.Overall impressed and highly recommended.
4,Overall it's a really good product but the ergonomics is just not good. I understand the reason for that. It's because it is meant to be a portable mouse and so they have tried to keep a slim profile for this particular product but it doesn't work for me. Some people could say that I should have gone for the MX Master series for a good overall ergonomics but those are way too expensive and so I went for this one instead. I'd like to end this review by mentioning that this is worth every penny spent but the ergonomics is just down right BAD if you look remove price from the equation.
5,Look and feel of this mouse is great. Right and left click is not completely silent but less audible than other mouse. Scroll is smooth and no noise at all. Comfortable to use though the mouse is slimmer and lighter than other traditional mouse. Can be connected to PC or laptop via Bluetooth or supplied 2.4 GHz dongle. Has on/off switch as well as a button to select Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz dongle.
1,"Pros:It looks good.Cons:* Bottom heavy design;  the mouse will slide towards you even with the slightest inclination.* Can only be used on perfectly flat surfaces.* The feet have zero fluidity, cushioning or grip; it feels like I am grating my desk with it!* The Bluetooth connection often resets itself.Awful design and btw, Logitech is extremely overrated. I also bought an wireless keyboard (Logitech K480) for my tablets, the keys are SO SO bad!"
5,"This review is written after two days of use. The mouse unit is smaller than generic mouses and easy to hold. People with bigger hands may find it uncomfortable to hold though. Nm It has both usb dongle and Bluetooth for true wireless experience. There is a button at the back to toggle between usb dongle and Bluetooth mode.While using Bluetooth mode usb dongle is not required. The mouse should be in Bluetooth mode(blue light, blue for Bluetooth) and it needs to be paired from the target device. Once paired it will connect automatically once turned on every time there after. In case we need to use it to a different device to unpair, a long press on the mode toggle button while in Bluetooth mode will do the jobFor usb dongle mode there is practically no hassle. We just need to remove magnetic top cover, get the dongle and plug it into laptop or desktop. Switch the mode to usb dongle mode(green light) and done. Also it remembers the mode. So next time is turned on it will be in usb dongle itself. Once done we can put back the dongle inside the mouse itself so chance of loosing it will be less. Also the dongle is extremely small.I am using it mostly for office work. It is pretty much silent as they claim. However the clicking experience is comparatively smoother than generic mouse. The precision is quite good. Works even on uneven bedsheet. I tried connecting it to Mac, windows 10 and Android Oreo in Bluetooth mode and it worked like charm in every case."
5,Awesome productVery very light and compactConnectivity is super ... connects to my ipad air 3 in just 1 or 2 sec and works greatButtons are also not lose and it looks damn goodGreat buy
5,"The pairing ease and the sleek minimalistic design is a strong pull of this product. Its not exactly the best fit in your hand  (perhaps for most male users with bigger hands) .... but its chic, feels awesome in your hands and is supported by your iPad Pro or any Bluetooth computing device for that matter ... laptops, tablets, fire tv ( although I haven’t used with fire tv much... but it got paired and was functional). Either this or M590 would be great for iPad users ... you need to understand how extensively you want to use a mouse for multi-tasking. iPads support customisable mouse keys and you can make full use of mouse buttons to enhance your productivity. In the end the silent click is super awesome and gives is a premium feel. Go for it ! Especially iPad users."
1,Stone age hardware and computer age price. Logitech you are not Apple to sell the stone at price of gold.
5,"I am writing this after a few hours of usage and below are my observations.1)  Portability: The primary reason for me to buy this mouse. its slim form factor allows you to slide this into your bag, pocket, cocoon organizer, or tech pack, anywhere, its an easy fit.2) Ergonomics: Fairly questionable. This is a trade-off with the form factor. Not suited for gaming or with people large palm.3) Connectivity: Fails to pair with my Lenovo T480 laptop via BlueTooth. Mostly because I did not read the instruction manual properly, I am sure there is a way around this. I do not want to use up the USB ports which is reserved for other devices like VoIP headphones or charging cables. With the receiver connected, it is fairly fast, accurate, and works very well for office tasks.4) For iPads: My second reason to buy this. Pairs fine works decently well. I would hand this to the operating system rather than hardware. The scroll is inverted, there is a fair-but-negligible amount of lag while using it my iPad Mini 5. I wouldn't complain as its primary job is office work, basic designing, or video editing.5) Price: Yes, it's near twice the price but designed to provide the value of 2 mice packed into one. Best suited for people carrying a laptop and iPad."
5,"It’s fantastic product. With Bluetooth I used it for 3D modelling in CatiaV5, very good performance.Easily connected to my IPad Pro as well, superb performance...Highly recommended"
5,"It has been a month since I got this beautiful thing during sale at just under Rs.1350. It comes with an alkaline battery and a usb receiver inside it magnetic flap cover. I haven't come across any cons yet, so I will just list down its pros below.1) Very aptly named as pebble; ergonomically designed and comfortable to hold.2) Super-silent3) Easy to setup and works like a charm4) It can connect to multiple devices both via bluetooth and usb receiver. I have even tried it on android phone.5) Eye-catching and beautiful to look at."
5,"The pebble literally lives up to its name. First of, the magnetic cover is such a brilliant idea. Even though you rarely open the cover up to change the battery or pull out the receiver from the slot, it is a satisfying feel. Coming to Bluetooth pairing, whenever you press the button to pair a device and connected, later if you need to pair to another device, press and hold the button until blue light blinks rapidly. There is no mention about this in the instruction. If this is not done, your device wont show up. Due to my limited knowledge about this, i had to replace the device later to realise the first one was also a functional device.Coming to ergonomics, initially you will find it little difficult to use for long sessions due to its slim profile, however you will get used to it in 2-3 days.Both Bluetooth and wireless connection mode are seamless with Windows 10."
5,"I searched for a affordable and Bluetooth Moise then I discovered this one after a long search and since it had both Bluetooth and usb connection it really mattered to me and I checked the featuresSlimSilentCompactBluetoothUsb connectionGood plasticsGreat battery lifeSturdySwitch modes in a clickLogitech qualityLogitech reliabilityColour optionsSmooth wheelComplete silent operationsHmmm don't know what else to comment I carry my laptop Evey day to my work and in my work able I have a desktop too so I have pared it via Bluetooth to laptop and via USB to desktop so now I got rid of my boring office pc mouse and I can operate both with this single one ,looks awesome and never seen such a long battery life,and it's so silent that I could not believe it and the feel of the click is so great and gentle on one's fingers the wheel scroll is took good toJust buy it and forget it and it's really worth Evey pennyDon't go for cheep stuff and regret , just buy this without a second thoughtHighly recommend:😃"
5,"I usually prefer little bigger mouse that should fit to my palm to avoid pain in palm and fingers. But it is really comfortable fit for all types of palms.Pros: Easy to connect via Bluetooth or USB, No click noise, comfortable fit to palm (big or small palm - added image with small mouse that usually causes me palm pain), connects Bluetooth quickly without manual operation every time, can also connect to mobile thru Bluetooth, Looks awesome.Cons: will not work if you enable ""Airplane Mode"" if it connected thru Bluetooth, Price is little higher but worth, top cap is magnate enabled one hence if fall down it removed easily so careful.Overall - I strongly recommend to go with this if your looking for Bluetooth enabled wireless mouse.Rgs,GCS"
1,Don't go by it's look and feel. The buttons lost sensitivity just after 7-8 months of regular moderate use. Now I have to click several times for one click to work. Always use those Rs 300 wired mouse guys. These overprices cuties are waste of money
1,"I have a smallish hand and loved the shape and size of the mouse. It can connect either with the bundled USB connector or over bluetooth. Bluetooth has no lag as long as the battery is good. But the left click button died in 8 months. Maybe because you need to snap off and remove the entire top (including the buttons) to replace the battery. I expect my mouse to last more than that, given that it's not particularly cheap. Way cheaper mouse are sturdier than this. And the RMA process is designed to mislead and frustrate"
1,"Very hard hard your thumb to hold it for long time as the shape was rounded where you hold your thumb.Clicks are super hard. I think that is the side effect of making it silent..Updated review:Throw it away. Immediately you could notice that your PC is performing super fast. Not exaggeration. Its true. After turning off this mouse I could feel that my PC was back to normal. Very thing including browsing, typing, switching windows was super slow. try disconnecting this stupid mouse your could see the performance. difference. It is not that I dont like Logitech. I own logitech mx master 3, logitech k380 keyboard. They are the best. I got this one because of different size and I wanted to try it."
3,Purchased this M350 Mouse for Rs- 1650 including card offer .This mouse works well with IPAD .But the mouse acceleration unable to control in ipados .so we have to reduce the tracking speed i have attached the screen shot .But with this speed pointer is very slow but no way to control the moue acceleration .But now i am use to it.Increasing the mouse speed increase the mouse acceleration and we won’t be able to click the object  as mouse pointer jumps which is very frustrating .The middle button can be customised in ipados not in mac os .Please be aware this mouse doesn’t support logitech option software both MAC and windows .But it works on both os with out customise option using ogitech option software  .I think the mouse acceleration issue is something apple has to update ipad os .not sure if this is the same case with mx master 2s mouse
5,It has both an infra & bluetooth receiver built in.The bluetooth connectivity is very useful while using with Ultrabooks that generally feature only one USB port that we need for our ext drives.Its low profile design makes it easy to slip in your pocket or slim cases.The battery compartment is accessible from the topside by pulling out the magnetic top.The only unattractive feature is its pricing which is slightly on the higher side.
5,"Greetings everyone.Today I am really pleased to review on Logitech M350 Bluetooth Mouse.Purchase:I purchased this Logitech Bluetooth Mouse online via Amazon website. I had cost me 1850 INR.The box was neat, the carton seemed intact and it was a new product. The date of manufacturing was Nov 2019. I was happy that the mouse was indeed so handy and small.Unbox:When I got the package, the carton was too small when compared to usual mice. I was happy to unbox which was very easy. The mouse had few stickers on glossy finish area and had a small plastic piece covering one of the AA battery. And yeah, you also get a single AA battery pre-installed.The mouse was too sleek, didn’t weigh much (only 109g) and was narrow. The buttons were smooth to press, and the scroll was also nearly soundless. However, the scroll button didn’t act as forward or back option in the mouse. Though it is a nit picking, I found this option more useful than others.Feel:The mouse is great to handle, and it is so sleek that it can fit into your pocket just like a wallet. One can assume it as a thick wallet. The feel and button pressing feels like premium. It is worth the money you spend.Features:The mouse acts as both Bluetooth and Wireless mouse. Yes, this is really an amazing option from Logitech. One can use this mouse as a Bluetooth Mouse if you have less USB ports and as a wireless mouse with the provided USB dongle.All you must do is to press the button at the back of the mouse to toggle from Bluetooth to Wireless. The colour representation is simple, blue for Bluetooth and green for Wireless option.Logitech says that the battery can last up to 18 months with minimum usage.The mouse uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology for better connectivity and power usage.Pros:Compact and sleekUses BLE for better power managementBattery lasts almost after 18 monthsVery low button sounds for quieter environmentsPortable and handyCan be used as both Bluetooth as well as wireless mouseStoring USB dongle is perfect in the mouse with a slotCons:Pricey a bitLosing dongle wouldn’t allow one to use unifying technologyBluetooth connectivity takes a bit more time than other miceMouse seems bit delicateConclusion:This mouse is handy and portable while compared to the conventional ones. It also features both Bluetooth and Wireless 2.4 Ghz technology. The connectivity is simple and easy. And comes with a battery that could last for 18 months. However, at the same time the price is bit more than usual ones and the Bluetooth connectivity takes a bit time. Some PCs which already had previous Bluetooth mice might create an issue with the m350. So, when it comes to sleekness and carrying, this promises to have taken sweet spot."
5,"I was initially apprehensive about buying a flat mouse, without the usual curve. However, after having used for a few days now, stress on my fingers has reduced immensely. Very soft to press, silent. Keep my fingers curved, hand on armrest of chair and press -  no pain in index finger anymore. Switches seamlessly between bluetooth and USB. The battery is supposed to last 18 months and was provided with the mouse. Very satisfied."
5,"Pros :1) Connects instantly2) very handy3) awesome battery life (Have been using it for 4 months, have not changed the battery since then. I use it 12 hours a day - every day.)4) classy5) Connects with mac book  or windows without any issues.6) automatically connects to the laptop as soon as you switch on your laptop.7) Dont need to turn off the mouse, it automatically sleeps if no action is happening.Cons:1) Costly2) scrolling makes noise.3) It so happened, after 3 months of use the mouse stopped responding. At the bottom of the mouse there was a small blue light blinking. As I did not know then what could the blinking light could mean, I assumed the battery might be low.So I changed the battery, which didnt resolve the issue.I reconnected with the bluetooth again, and all was suddenly ok.What I mean to say, after using the mouse for 3 months, this thing has started happening quite often.Meaning, suddenly the bluetooth disconnects.And you will have to manually connect to bluetooth.Up to this point which is 4 months of use, this has happend 3 times, of which all three times has been in last 30 days."
5,"I frequently use my PC and iPad and was looking for a mouse that works for both. Glad I found this one. Since it has Bluetooth, you can use it with mobile devices and it also contains a transmitter for wireless USB. It's extremely quiet and comfortable to use.The resolution is more than enough for everyday use and is good for gaming, but it's perhaps not the best choice for gaming.I've personally tested it with iPad OS, MacOS, Windows and Linux. It works flawlessly on all of them."
5,"This one has both bluetooth and 2.4 ghz connectivity .The best thing about this mouse is it has a slot for the usb connector in the battery compartment so that you need not worry about losing the connector .Click is so inaudible that you need to place the mouse near your ear to hear the click sound.The battery included is of good quality and surely lasts atleast an year.The on off switch functions smooth and it automatically switches off even if you forget to switch it off and leave the switch on.Once you move it or lift it from the surface,it switches on automatically ,so forgiving.It is well worth the price and the hype."
5,"The mouse is extremely easy to connect be it windows or Mac OS. I am using on both and its seamless. The fact that there is no clicking sound makes it even better for an user at home. This is a great tool for WFH. The looks are also very nice and if you pair it with a similar coloured keyboard from Logitech, then the overall look is quite elegant. Functioning and pairing are smooth, definitely recommended. Price is on the higher side but aesthetics make up for the same. PS. Note that the bluetooth dongle needs to be used only if your laptop doesn't have inbuilt bluetooth and bluetooth pairing is very easy."
5,"I purchased this mouse for bluetooth connectivity. And I am impressed with how quickly it connects with the laptop. Almost instantaneous once setup is complete. The keys make no perceptible noise and scroll button is smooth and quiet as well. Looks elegant on the table, saves space and fits well. Not the most ergonomic, especially for longer hours and for bigger hands due to smaller size, probably not for gaming also, but serves the basic functioning flawlessly. Very efficient and simple assembly design.In the box - Mouse with single AA battery already installed (just need to pull on the strip)"
4,"1. I don't know why people complain about ergonomics. This product is not meant for that, it is meant for it's compact size.2. It's heavier than it looks. But I think it's manageable.3. If you have big hands, you might not find it easy to hold. Small and medium size hand folks will find it okay.4. The clicks are silent than usual mouse that we use.Three reasons why I rated it 4 start instead of 5: -1. I had to order a replacement. The first one that got delivered looked like a used product.2. It's a little overpriced. Also, at this price, you should be able to scroll left and right as well using the mid scroll button click.3. It's a little heavier than it should ideally be."
5,"Perfect size for my palm. Can be used for design (like Photoshop) purpose as well. No lag in connecting or mouse pointer movement. Bluetooth connection works great. One small inconvenience is when you use this mouse with Windows and Mac book back to back, every time I need to delete the add the mouse in Bluetooth devices. Only then it works. However this issue is not there if you use only with Windows or Only with Macbook and iPad."
5,"- Dual Connectivity : Mouse has option to connect via inbuilt bluetooth( to any other bluetooth device) or via the usb provided. switching between the connections is simply a button click away on back of mouse.I use this to connect to windows and mac laptops. I use the usb for windows and bluetooth on mac. switching use between laptops is just click of button.- Thin - It is thin and ideal to carry in bags/pocket.- Erogonomic : Coming from the curved mouse design we it feels different initialy, but after some time.- Latest Tech: Uses invisible optic for tracking, silent clicks, compact design."
5,I bought one 6 months back and I was so impressed with the mouse that I bought this one too (This is my second one).Pros:Elegant and beautiful mouse.Usability is outstanding. It is small yet fits right in the palm and the button placements are perfect.It can be connected using Bluetooth and USB.Cons:Can't say anything really!I have read some negative comments and I understand people have their own preferences but this worked perfectly for me.
5,"I initially thought of buying economy make and then after watching few YouTube videos and going through comments I realized when I have spent almost a lac rupees does it makes sense to buy cheap unbranded mouse just to save few hundreds. What I did is right, I got a beautiful piece of gadget which will definitely last longer. It makes no sound ticking, flows like butter , not best but good ergonomic hold, connects in just wink of eye , no lag of cursor while using . U also get a usb Bluetooth adapter if you don't have built in Bluetooth option in your laptop. Overall 💯% satisfied"

5,"The size of the mouse is half of the regular mouse. It will take some time to get used to it but once you get accustomed you will like it. Works in both bluetooth and wifi mode. In bluetooth mode, for some reason it required a laptop restart. Company claims a stellar battery life of 18 months but that is still to be seen. Overall, happy with the purchase"
5,Nice form factor and feels premium. But. I think Need some getting used to for that slim flat profile if you are using a normal curved profile mouse. I was able to connect to lenovo tab easily via bluetooth. For some reason my moto x4 is not detecting the mouse with blue tooth. Will update review after some use. Have not tried the usb dongle yet. Strangely I did not see the red led tracker light come on when moving the pointer. But It still works.
1,The Bluetooth doesn’t work in Mac OS. I have to connect it to the USB each time I wanna use it. IT WAS A TERRIBLE BUY FOR ME. I HATE IT THAT I’M NOW STUCK WITH A DISGUSTING PIECE OF ITEM THAT COSTS A NEARLY SIX TIMES THE PRICE OF A NORMAL USB CONNECTED MOUSE.
1,I am using this product for 3 months now... Today after 3 months only it got stucked.. Its left click is not working... I tried to connect with ipad and laptop on both devices it is click is not working.. So expensive 1800 rupees and it stoped working al of a sudden..I dont know where to claom its warrenty... Pathetic experience..
5,"This mouse is very very good . I know people will think multiple times to invest a huge amount for a mouse . But this one is gold . The mouse is feather touch , have less response time. Amazing build and handy one . I have only good opinion about the mouse. USB receiver has a slot once you open the mouse which will help you to carry the mouse wherever you want without missing it .😆😆..I shall update regarding the quality after one month use . Heard this mouse can withstand a battery life of one year. If you are professional guys ..please invest in such a mouse . It gives your profession a classy touch convinience and moreover stand out in the crowd."
5,"I bought it to be used with my new Macbook Air M1 laptop. Using wireless receiver with USB C to A converter was not an efficient way and there was always possibility of bending due to unintentional pressure.I am very happy with this purchase as it's meeting my expectations of Bluetooth, portable mouse which also don't have any click noise. It also has wireless receiver which can be used to Connected to USB port if required. Top cover is magnetic to open mouse for access to battery and Wireless receiver.Although little pricy but still recommend this. I bought this after going thru reviews on Amazon."
4,"Quality is okay, but I think they are a bit expensive.  In this price, they should at least double the quantity, like 20 switches."
4,"I am a gamer and chose to buy the Outemu Reds to mod my keyboard. I bought 10 of them and switched my WASD, Space-bar, Esc, Enter and Backspace along with some other keys. Reds are naturally good for gaming because of their non tactile nature and suitable actuation force. And this is exactly what these Outemu switches deliver. These are excellent substitutes to Cherry MXs. But for just 10 switches a price of ₹600? These are great switches but are way overpriced. I like these switches and would have labelled them a perfect buy if not for the big price."
4,"Buy this only if the keys on your keyboard are hot swappable and don't make the mistake that I did.The keys that I got seem fine, but seem quite expensive for just 10 keys.Hopefully, I make use of this in the future."
2,"The keys have kind of inconsistent feed back. Some keys offer lighter click feel than others.For the asking price, it's not worth."
5,but costly. should have provided 20-30pcs
1,It destroyed my keyboard and I had to bear a loss
4,It's value for money
1,"Please double the pieces and people might actually buy it, we done these switches just for 10 key it has to be at-least 25 to 30"
1,"Check out websites like GenesisPC, Meckeys, StacksKB, Rectangles Store, etc. You will see better brand switches being sold for half the price of this one. The only reason people buy these overpriced Outemu switches is because they bought a cheap Redragon keyboard and thought buying these switches is cheaper than buying a new keyboard. Lets do some math shall we? 10 outemu switches cost Rs.679. For the Kumara K552, you'll need Rs.6000+ to buy a full set of switches for the keyboard. That's twice the price of the keyboard itself. For that price, you could buy the GK64 or Keychron K2 which are much better quality keyboards. It is crazy just how much they're charging for these switches."
3,"Outemus are standard 3 pin switches you'll find in most budget keyboards. So if you liked the switches that came with your keyboard, you'll like them.However, these are grossly overpriced. These cost roughly ₹69 per key but for that price, you'll get the best mechanical switches from Durock, Kailh, Gateron, even Glorious. Outemus should cost around ₹15/key so before you buy these take a look at the available alternatives.Look at StackKB, Meckeys, GenesisPC, Rectanges Store for more choices at better prices."
3,"Great clicky switches (Blues) with a uniform feel between all of them. Using for a musical rhythm sequencer without keycaps so can't say how they'll feel with them, but on the naked shaft, they feel good.This listing is really overpriced, really should be either half to a third of the price or twice to thrice as many switches."
1,"Bought it two days ago. Outside packaging was good but original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle was missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement."
5,"Excellent keyboard and mouse combo. Silent touch is very nice, I can't hear any sound from keyboard very quiet. I like it is water proof and has vents and holes in the bottom to drain any accidental spills. Mouse works and tracks nicely, accurate to the clicks and double clicks. One dongle only for the keyboard and mouse so no need to worry about using up 2 ports. Both mouse and keyboard has a place to plug the USB dongle while not in use so you don't fear of losing. Also both mouse and keyboard has on-off buttons so you can save battery by switching it off by your end of day."
3,"No issues with the functioning of the keyboard and mouse. They are both working well. I am satisfied with the ""silent"" feature. However, I found the keyboard keys slightly harder on the fingers than I would like. And my biggest issue is, the mouse doesn't come with rubber base. So it slips if you use it on a slanted table/desk. It's not even standing on normal mouse pads. I have to find a mouse pad that has a non-smooth antislip surface.Update after 6 months of minimal usage : Left button of the mouse stopped working. The mouse is useless now."
5,"The keyboard is excellent. As described in the product description it is very silent. I can’t hear it over my fan. That is more than good enough for me. I bought this product assuming that I can connect it to Logitech unifying receiver. I have a M720 mouse which I love to bits. I wanted to give this mouse to my wife and use just the keyboard. I realized only after unboxing that it will only work with the USB dongle it came with. I wanted to return the product, I tried using the keyboard for a day and decided the keyboard alone was worth paying the 2,500 and I kept the product. I wish the keyboard is supported by the Logitech options software. I could have changed the key binding of some of the shortcut keys given at the top.Don’t get me wrong mouse is not bad, it just too small for me. I am very used to my M720 which is almost as big as MX Master. Mouse tracking is good. But, as mentioned in some other reviews it is super light and have very little resistance on a wooden table. It just flies from one corner of the screen to another. May be with some use I can get used to the weight of this mouse. It is not a fair comparison to compare this to my M720 as that mouse alone cost almost twice as much as this combo. This mouse is supported by the Logitech options software and you can assign around 5 shortcuts to the mouse which is great to see at this price point."
1,Very poor order delivery. First time the order was received without the usb receiver. Returned and reordered. The rellace.ent came without the mouse !!
3,"After 2 days:Keyboard is not working in Mac and Ubuntu/Linux OS.I need to close to the USB receiver ( 2-5cm distance) in order to work.For this price 2395 it is not worth.Other keyboard K220 bought a year before working fine. Need a replacement.Initial Impression:This is one of the best keyboard and mouse i ever used.Typing speed is absolutly very smooth and there is no key press sound. Very little noise but it wont disturb any one who is near by.Mouse is really silky smooth and no click sound at all.only thing it has very soft keys no soundmouse is really smooth and very silent.Price wise this is little high 2395, if it is 1999 it would be best value for money.one USB nano receiver is great to handle both keyboard and mouse.I am using this keyboard for my raspberry pi 4. Since RPI4 has limitted USB ports so using this one USB receiver is really helpful."
1,5 stars for product but 2 stars for seller.Product received was not seal packed. I could make out that tapes were opened and then re-pasted. The mouse from keyboard mouse combo was not working. Keyboard was working very well.So i placed return with replacement order. I received the replacement within a day but i was scared looking at the condition of the replaced product box. It was battered with tape applied instead of original seal tape. I have uploaded photographs of the packing.Fortunately this time both mouse and keyboard are working and are working good.
3,"I received the the product in just 9 hours, delivery wise and packaging wise everything was good, the boxes were in very good condition without any damageChanging my comment on the product in just two days.  1) I feel the key press should have been little more softer  2) I did one test with this keyboard and the dell laptop keyboard in the night when it completely pin drop silence  environment.  what i observed was that the dell laptop keyboard is also not silent but the key press noise is lower  compare to the Logitech keyboard.  i tried typing few sentences with the Logitech keyboard and same sentences again with the dell laptop  keyboard.  3) if you type slow also there is noise on the key press.  4) found that only the alpha keys , numeric keys(not the numpad keys) , arrow keys,  5) space bar, tab, enter, shift, alt, ctrl key are somewhat silent compared to the alpha and numeric keys  6) Price is very high  and the usb receiver is also not unifying one at this price.  7) even the click of the mouse button is not silent as mentioned. I have Logitech M331, which is way silent than  the M220 mouse provided with the keyboard.reducing my rating of this product just because it does not meet the requirement of silent touch, also i have given the product 3 star just because it is not that bad as well if you see the other aspects of product like the plastic quality is good, you have volume control option and also I don't have any doubt on the battery life because i have already used Logitech product earlier as well and they proved to be lasting longer compared to dell mouse where i used to change the batteries twice or thrice in a month."
5,"i liked the keyboard, i have the habit working late with my kids working beside. typing my older keyboards wake up my kid and disturb his sleep. this is one is so silent soft work. very sift srispy typing feel i get. it has capslock indicator which is sufficient for as numlocks and scroll locks i hardly use.Mouse too is very silent soft. it has very high promising battery life, hop it lasts long.It has been 8 months, now i observe first signs of low battery, connectivity issues comes up. Yes alkaline batteries do last long, really long in this keyboard"
5,"Writing this review after one week of use.It is a very good quality combo set of keyboard and mouse.. Received in perfect condition. Keyboard and Mouse both are super silent (no tik-tik anymore). Full size keyboard. Medium size mouse (Model: M220-SilentTouch). Just plug the tiny receiver, switch ON the keyboard and Mouse buttons and it immediately starts working. Get rid of hassles of wiresI had also checked Logitech MK270R combo which was approx. Rs.1000 less than this but finally decided to go with this due to the factors such as Silent Touch, Longer Battery Life and Newer Model. And after using it for a week, I think it was a good decision.I recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of wiring around their PC/Laptop and looking for clean desk.Overall a very nice product and good buy."
5,"Finally the best after trying 3 different one, tired the Dell entry level combo (that was undoubted worst) then tried Logitech MK345 it works like a typewriter ( key punch sounds) , sold that on olx for half the price when I purchased this one . Not about the product . Its just AWSOME ! , the key feel and the mouse both . Keyboard is very well built and feels great . Both keyboard and mouse have rugged feel when you touch. Its great in the Work from Home environment specially if you work late night and don't want to disturb  someone with the keystrokes and mouse clicks . Not only keyboard even the mouse clicks are (almost) noise less . This is not 100% silent but no one should be able to hear and gets disturbed by the keystroke noise . if you want to quantify of noise eradication will it eradicates more than 90-95% key click noise"
4,Wow.. i am really surprised with this keyboard. This is exactly what i was looking for in a keyboard all my life. I have been searching for a keyboard where i dont get those irritated clicking noise in my mouse and keyboard both and wanted a very soft touching slient option. My search ended here. But my search was little ruined as the layout of the keyboard is not to my taste.The buttons dont have spacing between them. Even the lines between keys are not much. I want a better layout to make this as perfect choice of keyboard for life.I like big layout style keyboard for faster typing speeds along with hand rest at the bottom and multimedia keys for faster handling of medias.
1,"The moment I opened the package, I could see that it was already opened by someone and then put together half heartedly. I anyway gave it a chance and connected to my laptop. The connection was fast and there was no visible lag. However, the keys were malfunctioning a lot. Changing language automatically, some of the keys not working at times (you have to remove the receiver and plug it in again). I have raised a request for the replacement. Will update once the replacement is here."
4,"What I like:1. Excellent keyboard. Just the right weight, sturdy, does not slide away when you type, good wireless connection, smooth & silent typing, good travel of keys. Note: This keyboard makes absolutely no sound at all and if you are one who enjoys your keyboard's sound - this is not the product for you.2. The mouse is precise in its working. Clicks are silent.3. Product is well packaged. The receiver is kept in an easily accessible place in the carton box.4. There is a place to store the receiver (below the keyboard), if you wish to carry the product around.What could have been better:1. The mouse is very small for my hand. For this price, they could have given a full size mouse. The current mouse is not comfortable to use if you have medium to large hands.2. The scroll wheel of the mouse is very noisy.2. The caps-lock LED is almost useless as it is too dim to be visible during the day."
5,"The keys are silent - they don't make clicky noises. That's not to say it doesn't make sound, it does. It's just muffled and low-frequency.The keys are sturdy and seem to be of good quality for the price. I personally feel there's a bit too much resistance though. Typing casually is fine, but if you're a writer and write multiple pages per day, maybe you should consider chicklet style keys. I use this primarily for work, to compose a few emails per day, interact with others on chat, and create occasional documents, and I have been very satisfied with it. On long typing sessions, it sure gives your fingers a workout, but it's not a deal breaker."
4,"The keyboard is extremely quiet, although the typing is not that comfortable due to the key feedback being a little too hard. Maybe that will be ok after getting used to it.Separate indicator for caps lock but none for num lock. Otherwise keyboard has all the keys in the right place.Truly plug and play with both Ubuntu and Windows"
4,"This is a good product. I am writing this review after using this keyboard-mouse combo for around 1 month and I am satisfied with this product.Keyboard is about 90% silent and is easy to use; no tak-tak noise but still some sort of sound is there while typing, which is ok. Also Mouse is working good and has a good grip."
4,"I don’t think I can get used to using this silent touch, basically compared to the mechanical keyboard I have used, I think I keep getting the keys wrong always, it feels small and does not fit well. The typing experience is a bit down but it’s super silent for one and has the promised wireless. Basically I needed it for using whenever I get on bed, so it doesn’t father me much now, but as a main keyboard it lacks at a lot of places, at this price range"
4,Box was a mess(the sets box). But the product itself is very very silent. If you using mk270 then the difference will be the feel of mesh can be felt clearly. So if you dont mind little hard on gaming you can go for it else 270 or some other i guess? Only 4 stars since box is ruined.Ps: The switch sure helps out the battery.
1,The keyboard isn't working properly. There is so much lag sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Such a pathetic product with such high price. Bought it after reading reviews but all my money got wasted. Logitech being such a big and famous brand selling such kind of products. Shame!!
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Product is amazing. Very soft keys and silent as they mentioned.  Mouse is good as well but in my case i got used one so asked for replacement.
5,"Connected immediately to my macbook with no issues at all.Is very smooth, silent and seamless typing experience - I am sure it will help improve the productivity. Mouse is working quite well too.  Build quality is pretty decent and it claims to be spill-proof which I hope I don’t have to test... ;)"
4,"Very good product no doubt but there are some disadvantages in it, which should be modified I think!First of all, there's no Num Lock indicator in the keyboard.Secondly, dislike the mouse, the keyboard on/off switch don't have any color (Red/Green) indication."
5,This is one the best silent wireless keyboard & mouse.FN keys dosn`t have any secondary keys like (multimedia shortcuts) which is good thing for the ppl who uses software like autocad & 3d design software & dedicated multimedia buttons are provided on the above of FN keys.this model is very very silent & good for those who is doing WFH & so that no one gets disturbed by keyboard/mouse pressing sounds & this keyboard & mouse has on/off switch too.loved it very much.CAPSLOCK INDICATOR LIGHT PRESENT & it dosnt switches off automaticaalyBUT NUM LOCK LIGHT NOT PRESENT.
4,"It's good only for a limited use, not for programming or typing.I liked its silent touch technology. Worth it!Only the wheel of the mouse makes high noise, in fact some poor grade kind of mouse noise.Again, the Amazon delivery is the worst, no bubble wrapping, no brown paper box. One of the corners of the keyboard got broken a bit."
4,Overall product is good. I cannot comment on battery as its news so use ur judgement. The only sketchy part is the on/off slide switch they are of plastic and i don't know how long would they survive esp the mouse one.. I felt they should have used the metal switch like dell which could be robust for the price we are paying. That's it for now. Cheers!
1,"I bought this product and found Keyboard is not working properly. I had requested for replacement of the product. But, the replaced product was not in good condition at all. I have returned all the keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle. However, the replaced product which I got today looks like the original box inside was open. Only keyboard inside, mouse & receiver/dongle were missing. Clearly, Amazon""s quality check going down. I have applied for replacement.  I need to apply for replacement again which is really annoying. I think whoever from Amazon is reviewing these comments should immediately act on it to get the good sealed product with good condition should be delivered on time."
5,"Very good and interesting product. The silence while typing is very weird initially cause the feeling of keys while typing is same. Only complaint would be that mouse is size small and not most ergonomic, but cant complain too much at this price point."
5,A good keyboard with silent touch and mouse with silent click as expected. So far working well. Hope it lasts well. The functioning of the keys is much better than the earlier Logitech model that I was using.Packet delivery was professional.
3,"It is actually a silent keyboard when compared to other regular keyboards. Although it has some sound though from the key travel, it's not loud enough to disturb anyone outside the room. I am using a full size keyboard after years and it's actually quite comfortable after you get used to it.I do not like the mouse at all. It's not ergonomic design so using it for long working sessions is very uncomfortable. But that's least of the problems. The mouse hangs between two monitors which is very annoying. I have tried adjusting the settings but this problem hasn't resolved."
5,To unleash the full potential download Logitech Options software from Logitech to customize the mouse buttons and actions. To customize keyboard download Karabiner-Elements and you can map all the keys.Overall the experience is splendid and the keys are great for typing!!
5,"Logitech MK295 wireless keyboard and M220 wireless mouse combo is a great buy in terms of product quality. Buttons are really silent. This combo stands up to my expectation in terms of quality. I believe the Price is a little on higher side. If it could be priced in range of INR 1800 - INR 2000, it would make this product Superb value for money."
5,"I have used many logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the past, but this model is fun to use, just because of its silent feature. Many in the past has failed due to mouse click issues and dongle issues, hope this lives to the expectation."
5,"I was using mk275 logitech prior to this. Had a bad experience with that one, noisy keys, with couple of keys not working properly. Was skeptical about this one. BUT - this is an excellent keyboard. It really is silent! no noise. All keys have excellent feel, not missing any letters. It also has a capslock indicator. I would say its really a great keyboard and mouse combo. Go for it."
1,"the keyboard is great and very sleek and silent. but couple of keys not working when i used it. unfortunately i noticed the issue after the return window elapsed. now i am left with a keyboard without caps lock ,shift key and number 7"
2,"Poor packaging, and not put together well. The side stands are not nailed/ screwed properly and it wobbles.Don’t buy this if you want quality."
1,I am talking generally about this product.. All products from Cosmic Byte are useless.. This keyboard is my second one and it got spoilt within a month without doing anything.. I used it to play some small games which does not need spamming of keys.. When I connnected it back to my PC after a week it wasn't working.. None of the keys work.. Only the lights come on.. I tried askinn for the warranty  and no one from their Customer Service Respond.. If you want to experience anny of the above Non-Sense which happened to me then you can have a look at the keyboard.. If not say 'NO' to all Cosmic Byte Products!!
5,"I have bought this in Feb 2018. So, it's a long term review. Things I've noticed so far are the keys have a lot of travel than a normal mechanical keyboard, backlighting has only 2 modes: Normal and breathing effects. Well designed for gaming and durability is really good as body of the keyboard is made of metal. Keyboard keeps my palm cool even after using it for hours. The only cons I've come across are color damage on keys and metal parts, dust accumulation under keys, but you can clean them easily. Overall, I'm much satisfied with this product and would suggest it as best value for money gaming keyboard."
5,Very good build quality... Same as description... Fast and safe delivery ... Well packed from seller ... Easy to install .. working well for me ... Using from last 10 days .. satisfied... 👍👍👍
4,"Good Keyboard for beginners and casual gamers. I have used it for over 1.5 years and  I don't have any issues with this keyboard. Must buy if you are looking for a cheap keyboard.This is not a mechanical keyboard.UPDATE: I have used it for 3 years, working fine, just S and D keycaps lettering are faded because I used to game a lot and I keep on pressing S and D keys. I still recommend this keyboard."
2,"The build quality of the keyboard is fine as it has a metal plate on the top so there is minimal or no deck flex. The lighting is fine. The colors can't be changed but the brightness can be increased or decreased and there is also a breathing effect. For the people who want these qualities it's a good keyboard. BUT...... if you want literally anything else the one I got was not at all good. The keys are very mushy and it does not feel good to type on. The actuation force on the keys are uneven, it takes a lot of force to start pressing the key but the rest of the key's travel requires no force at all which is very annoying if you type a lot or game. Then there is the spacebar, Oh.. The Spacebar...it's just bad. The spacebar is so heavy that it requires no activation force to press and the key struggles to bring it up. The spacebar bounces back if you slam it but if press it gently like normal people it gets stuck to the chassis of the keyboard. This is VERY annoying if you use the keyboard at all because the spacebar gets stuck and you have to pull it up to use it again (this issue of the spacebar getting stuck maybe exclusive to my particular unit, but however the actuation force is non-existent on the spacebar). So consider whether the spacebar issue is important for before you buy this product, I game a lot and use the spacebar very much so it is an instant deal-breaker for me, and if you game I suggest you stay away from this keyboard. But if you are buying it for casual use go for it."
1,"Update after 1m: Key smoothness was already a problem and now in just a month the wasd key started losing its colour.I regret buying this.If you are gamer then don't buy it. My redgear keyboard worth Rs.999 is much better than this Rs.1099 keyboardSometimes i type for giving a quick msg to my teammate so that they could aware of the situation but this keyboard make me raze. The key stuck most of the time like 90% and so it doesn't press easily and you lost your typing rythem!The key WASD sometimes stuck which gives a free kill to your opponent when you try quick peek in games like csgo, valorant. I don't recommend you this at all.I'm reviewing after 1 month of approximate uses,so the product might look good at first view but sooner you will lose that moving/typing pace. Goodluck, rest is upto you."
5,"At the very beginning I wanted to return it but it can only be replaced, sad. Its good keyboard, durable but I thought it's not built for gaming or casual use because of the way the keys were designed, they are not flat or symmetrical. but... it was my fault not being able to adapt the design, after struggling for 2 -3 days I was able to adapt the key design and I'm able to use it without any problems. still the design of ctrl and shift button makes no sense as while gaming you have to immediately switch between ctrl to shift but the way these two keys are made completely opposite angles that it's annoying. Maybe need more practice but instead of learning how to use a keyboard the designers should have focused on how friendly it looks for gamers... looks and design don't matter, they should be simple as possible, just add RGB in any mechanical keyboard and it's gaming keyboard 👍 (sarcasm)"
3,"It is a good keyboard except one issue - The spacebar key. It requires 3 times force to press it compared to other keys when you press it at the ends of the spacebar. If you press it at the center, it works fine, but I press it at the ends with my thumb, thus it becomes impossible to type because for every space, I would have to press with three times the force, thus destroying the flow of the typing. Due to this one flaw, I had to return it as it made it unusable to me.Another minor issue is the big cosmic byte logo right above the arrow keys. You would think it is something written on the keyboard, but no, it is a plastic component with height same as a pressed key. This makes it annoying when you press the up arrow key and it hits your fingers. Please don't put such huge logos on an otherwise good keyboard.The keyboard build quality is excellent. It is metal, and keys have a nice feel to it. The lighting is also excellent. I don't know why they made these two issues with otherwise a very good keyboard. I bought it because my friend had a two year old cosmicbyte keyboard which was excellent and had none of these issues, and that was the only reason I choce a cosmicbyte keyboard, and now they have these issues..."
4,First of all the keyboard is very sturdy. It's backplate us made up of aluminium. This keyboard is a membrane keyboard not a mechanical one. If you plan on typing with this don't buy ut. It is strictly for gaming. Typing experience was not good. I gave it a 4 star because I am gamer and the backlighting was also good . Because typing was up to the mark it would have been a 5 star.
5,"I am not a gamer so i cant tell you about the gaming abilities of the keyboard.. but it has sevral controls.About the visibility in the dark the keyboard works well, very well lit keys. You can easily type without any light in the room.Sturdiness: The built qualiity is very nice. Keys are housed very well in the aluminum frame.Key pressing is also very satisfying. And the cable is also very durable. Loved the product.Only draw back is that it came without mouse."
1,"I got this item as I was looking for a budget gaming keyboard and it looked pretty while marketed itself as having anti ghosting keys. I got the first item, tested it and I got disappointed as the space key one pressed remained so and didn't pop back. I couldn't get the refund and ordered exchange and got it within 2 days. To my shock the exchanged one has exact same issue. Now, I have no choice but to settle with it. Neither I have time not patience to replace again. Disappointing product."
5,The metal floor makes it look really premium..and the lightning also looks great..it’s the best keyboard for this price
3,Packaging review:The packing was so poor that it didn't even had the bubble wrapping around it or anything to protect the product from external damage and from the pictures you can figure out that the product box itself was sticked using several tapes as it was torn from corners and middle. No so good service from seller himself.Product review:This keyboard is not for the people who like fast typing andlike to have fast response from the key pressing. You can buy this product for the price and features it offers but its not for everyone. You have to press keys little bit harder and right in the center which is not convenient while fast typing nor for gaming at certain extent. Don't buy this product just because it offers aluminium body which is not even how the keyboard should be described because it doesn't have aluminium body but only the upper part of keyboard if made out of aluminium and rest of the keyboard is still plastic which is also not of good quality.They plastic key caps looks paints after assembling the keyboard as they have shadow paint marks on them.Overall this keyboard is good for the price but you can get even better keyboard at this price point in the market.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"Pros:-Comes with a metal base-Build quality is solid-Typing feels good-Multiple levels of brightness-Looks real goodCons:-Cant customize the lights-Could have been better if the lights were a bit brighterOverall, good for the amount you pay. Definitely gonna last long.Go for it!"
3,The keys itself are good and the backlit RGB are super bright. The paint work on the left palm rest peeled off after a couple of weeks since the material is built from an aluminium body. I advise you to buy another keyboard with a plastic body if you're a heavy gamer that constantly rests his left hand on the keyboard.
1,After few days (15-20) it stopped functioning
2,I regret taking this keyboard. It's good for gaming. Hear me completely. The only keys that will u will use while gaming are wasd ctrl shift spacbar alt.  The rest of the keys won't work as smooth as these. For typing no way you should even think of this keyboard.Keys like backspace and alphabet etc won't even be clickable sometimes . It's just too stiff. If you are a casual Gamer and have another keyboard go with this. No other keyboard and a hardcore Gamer buy something else.
1,"I honestly liked its sturdiness and ordered. Problem is None of the keys get pressed.  Bang it... one... twice , thrice. It just does not get pressed. Mind you , I like hard things, and I am not a soft typing guy. I peck keys once at a time and I type hard. May be, Hard luck for me in this piece, and I am rating my piece at this level.  May be... Maybe there are other good pieces. God bless"
5,I was wishing for a metal body .. the plastic is thin on the borders... Keyboard performance is best according to the pricing of the product...the cable is long and braided so that there won't be working problem.... And yes please can you (cosmic byte) give another mode for the lights as fade or colour change.. as it gets boring after some time. Key quality is good...
5,"Very durable, sturdy, assuring key press with subtle quietness. I had bought another membrane keyboard from amazon but this is cheaper, sleeker, very very cool to use. Just buy it. The only con is there are no single color lighting. The multicolor stays on or off,  but is never a deal-breaker. Just buy it."
4,The key board is good. But you only get two effects in it simple and breathing. It will take time to get use to this keyboard. For gaming it a nice keyboard but for business and sturdyness I would prefer you the corona model of this keyboard. It is aluminum build around the keyboard but if it falls from your hand and something else I think it will break as it is not so strong. And the keys are removable so cleaning is not a problem. BTW it is a nice keyboard but I would recommend you to go with corona model as it is much more better than this on the difference of 100 rs. Thanks
5,Awesome keyboard... with a premium look.Keys are so soft and some particular keys have different sounds ...But there is an issu on my keyboard...Space key is too loose. Often it doesn't move up after press .... I think i have to put an extra Spring to it ...
2,I would not recommend this keyboard.. After 1 n half months the keys started becoming hard like literally we have to press the button hard then it would work.. I thought it might be defective but my friend also brought the same model  and he is facing same problem... Besides this the keyboard is great
5,"It is very good as I'm a beginner right now and I asked my pro friend about it but he said "" It still is very good but for beginner. I don't quite like it"". He alway suggests me things that makes me better an he said he woul recommend it for gaming for beginners"
3,Keyboard i got at first was good but it had few keys on which there was very low lighting so i went for replacing it. But the keyboard i got after replacement has even more dim lights and more keys where there is no lighting in it. Product is good for usage but my only issue is with this defect in backlight.
1,"Packing was not good and coming to the keyboard backspace, zero in num pad, and the num pad enter keys doesn't have the stablider rods . Its so annoying to type especially while pressing the backspace its doesn't go smoothly . Don't waste your money. ""Go for other keyboards or for some extra 800-1000 bucks u can get a machanical keyboard don't do the same  mistake I did"". Hope this helps others ."
1,Totally bad Don't but it + key is not working it is stickingAnd colour can't be changedKey are hardI didn't gor warranty cardBox wass damagedAnd in user manualSomething is written from pen totally bad product
5,quality wise 5/5Keys sensitivity 5/5Led backlight brightness 4/5Price 4.6/5Overall good product only disappointed with LED brightness it should have more brightness for better display
5,"Great keyboard to ha e for the price, especially as a back up for ur laptop. Helps a lot for gaming. Would recommend 100% those who are laptop owners. And looking for a budget keyboard."
2,Its switches are very hard they don't click when I want them to click. but a steady keyboard. It was good at the start but gradually it started to show its true RGB colours. It's good for breaking someone's head because it's very hard *ie keys and body. Good weapons for self-defence best for women in offices to hit their creepy co-workers can be sold for women safety.
3,"Pros:Sturdy keyboard.Good backlit keyboard in easy priceSilent keyboardCons:Will not recommend for Typing. Keys are becoming hard with usage.IF keys are not pressed in center, it will be too hard to press keys.Enter key is not proper. It looks its a Europian layout."
1,Umm.... no. Don't buy it. The keys get stuck all the time unless you use precise angle to hit them. A keyboards first function is to be able to type correctly but all the keys keep getting stuck.
5,"After having this keyboard for almost a year there are no problems. Except the keys paint fading, ofcourse this is not too serious. A really great keyboard for the buck. If you are on the budget jus buy it!"
4,"I had TVS gold, I threw it aside and bought a logitech double the price of TVS.My logitech went bad in a year, replaced in warranty then got another shock after warranty over.What I learnt Shelling out too much money just for the brand name is foolishness.Again I have started using TVS but now it's the prime one 👍"
2,"I was excited as anyone to get my hands on a TVS Gold Prime keyboard and glide all the way, and I expected it to be the gold standard to invest in for a few years down the line.Now hardly within a month of my purchase, I am sensing issues in the keys and circuitry of this keyboard such as following behaviours:1. Once in a while, the 'Enter' keypress does nothing.2. Unlike my keyboard preference, more than once in a day, I suffer a sticky keyboard repeat rate. Any key including 'Enter' may behave as if been pressed too many times and no finger rested and slept on those keys.3. While I am a user of 'Mouse-keys' for many years, it is funny to see while sticky use of 'Left Arrow key' misses functioning a lot of times, and other times it starts moving the mouse cursor towards the left of the screen in a ghostly fashion.I will try contacting the TVS Support but I am disappointed that I will have to indulge in a troublesome support activity when there is a pandemic outside, which is why I invested in a much-proven keyboard in the first place."
4,"The build quality is superb, however I am seeing a trend of broken frame issue with many orders here on amazon and mine has too. I am assuming this is some manufacturing defect in this model. It is however, not major and I was able to fix that with just small strip of tape and it was held in place nicely.Typing experience: If you're coming from a membrane keyboard, the typing experience is going to be excellent for you. My unit came with Long Hua red keys - they are tactile and gives good feedback when a key is registered. Each key stroke produces the typical mechanical keyboard sound which can disturb someone else in the room depending upon the ambience sound inside the room. The sound personally doesn't bother me, in fact I love the sound feedback :) The keyboard is very ergonomic and the back stand offers a good tilt for a comfortable typing experience. Horizontal pen holder above is an added bonus.Quick Pros:1. Solid build quality2. Excellent cable quality (approximately one meter long)3. Good tactile keys (would've been better if it was a cherry mx, but I'm literally having no complaints with this one too)Quick Cons:1. No multimedia controls (This  is a slight bummer media control keys are present in even low budget membrane keyboards these days)2. Key caps and print quality is slight just above average"
5,"This an amazing Keyboard for the given price point. there some great advantages:1. Its mechanical,  the typing is amazing on a mechanical keyboard and the feedback from the keys is really good.2. Its way cheaper than many other mechanical keyboards.3. Its an Indian product, made by TVS electronics, which are making keyboards at least since last 20+ years. Although the keys used might be Chinese.4. Build quality, is great and the typing experience is amazing.Minor Disadvantages:1. There are no dedicated media keys or function keys.2. Some people may find it noisy, however, to me this is the sound of quality.3. This is out of my personal experience, the placement of space bar is bit awkward. so when i initially started using it the space bar I was feeling bit awkward to press it via thumb, however, it was just a matter of getting used to the keyboard style and layout. So its not really a disadvantage but just a matter of being habitual to it. Same is the experience with the small backspace key.Overall, its an amazing keyboard and people looking for a keyboard for office work and typing can buy it blindly.I can't say the same about gamers. While i purchased this one i did had a look at all other mechanical keyboards in the market, even the likes of Corsair mechanical keyboard. The problem for such high end keyboards is the price, i mean do an average user really needs so many fancy features? I doubt, still those who think they need those features given other high end keyboards can certainly go for it. But the thing is that this is a 2.5K keyboard and will easily last 4-5 years (I won't be surprised if it lasts 8-10 years). On the other hand a high end mechanical keyboard cost on an average 12-16K. So effectively i can buy, 5 or 6 TVS gold keyboard in the same price and use for next 20 - 25 years.Probably that's a bit too much of an extrapolation. :DAnyway, to summarize, this is a great keyboard for a person who is setting up a work desk for work from home. GO FOR IT !!!!Cheers."
4,"like: mechanical keyboard under 3000 Rs. Fast delivery.Slight dislike for: one of the base screw fixture is slightly broken causing a slight gap.Additional detail: Long hua switch, tactile & clicky. smooth key strokes. i found clicky sound level is appropriate and is not noisy. Does not cause irritation to ears. Even though switch color is red, they are tactile & clicky."
5,"The feedback the keyboard gives while typing is needed to type without looking at the keyboard using the home row method. And this keyboard is good to have while you are learning home row method of typing.JUST IT IS NOT WIFI ENABLED, it doesn't mean it is bad. When you use wifi enabled keyboards you use battery and also laptop energy to the receiver usb dongle. Here you just use laptop energy for the whole keyboard, which is much more economical. Laptop doesn't discharge more as you think...But it is a luck to have the keys proper while shipping, but i had that luck. The space bar is heavy to press initially, it becomes softer later. It is somewhat heavy but it is for a reason that the keyboard doesn't move while you are typing aggressively at a speed of 80WPM ... You can even reach 200 WPM with this wired keyboard if you practice but you can't reach that much speed on the wireless as the latency comes into the play at that point. So FORGET the wireless things, The best fast latencyless typing is only on a wired keyboard."
5,Big and spacious keyboard. Definitely useful for people with large hands like me. This is a simple looking keyboard but with solid build quality. The typing experience is very smooth and it requires very little force and not very noisy. I am not sure of the type of keys being used but the experience as I mentioned is awesome. Must buy if you are looking for a good mechanical keyboard with less price.
1,"I am returning this product because the space key was not placed on the keyboard and its spring and other small tabs were found in the packing box, I am not a techie that I can place it correctly, also it was a little damaged. They should have a proper quality check for this."
5,"Fantastic keyboard .. I had first used TVS Gold keyboard about 25 years ago and since then used many others. Bought it for pure nostalgia and the typing pleasure. Nothing else matches this keyboard in typing experience. The click sounds are music to the ears .. especially if you are a programmer or writer .. although it is a bit expensive as compared to other keyboards but if you believe in buying the best, close your eyes and go for it. The sturdiness and layout is as it used to be back in the old days. Old is Gold .. and definitely TVS Gold justifies its price."
1,"The Keyboard is completely defective. Some of its keys are missing. Some aren't working. Moreover the model that I placed an order for, was not the one sent over to me. I have been sent the wrong model and is of substandard quality."
3,"It is a really good keyboard with a major issue.FN key is missing - TVS should definitely add Fn keys to their keyboards. Then media controls can also be provided through them.different layout - Weird positioning of the `|\` key (right before backspace key), making the backspace key smaller. Also, the space bar is a bit hard to press.Except for these issues, the keyboard is really good to use."
5,An excellent desktop keyboard.  I have used more than 5 brands.  This is the best one when compared with others.  The price is high but affordable when compared in the long run.Tested all the keys and found in good condition. More happy to possess the key board. The satisfaction is more than expected. Thanks to TVS Electronics and Amazon.
5,"I used this keyboard from 2006 to 2010. Later on, I was doing my work on my laptop but when work load increased, I was badly missing this father of all keyboard.You can buy it with full confidence. There are no cons. However the White TVS Gold was more attractive. But it's nothing different in terms of quality. Thanks Amazon."
1,Space button is hardButtons has notice also
5,I like it.. build quality super.. Buy it
3,The key board is good except for the space bar key which was performing well for the initial 10-12 days but now has become hard. there seems some manufacturing defect. Seller should replace it.

4,"It is a good wireless keyboard. The keyboard keys size is small than the normal keyboard nave, if that is not your concern then you can definitely consider this one.  Mouse size medium.It will instantly connect when the dongle is a plugin to a laptop, PC, or tv. The keyboard and mouse go to sleep when you remove the dongle to save the power.I have used the wireless keyboard and mouse on my laptop and Samsung Tv it is working smoothly on both of them."

5,"Very Nice Gaming Pad.RGB looks amazing. Lots of modes for RGB.Ergonomics On Point.Blue switches feel good and clicky. Little loud, might disturb someone's sleep.Check dimensions for a narrow table. Its pretty big in size.Lots of options for mapping.Can go upto 1000hz. 4 profiles.Overall really good for the price."
5,"A lot of people here have spoken about this keyboard from a gamer's point of view but not many appreciate K585's ability to record macros and use it for ONLY productivity or office workMacro Keypads are not a thing in India (atleast for now). One has to import them from USA mostly. We do have full size Keyboards with dedicated macro keys but lets be honest, some of them are quite expensive. I was in the market for a macro keypad but couldn't find any. I already have two full sized mechanical keyboards lying around so buying another with dedicated macro keys wasn't an option.K585 is expensive compared to other one-handed keyboards but it does the work it's intended for. It also has software support which is a plus. Zebronic's one hand KB is cheaper but you don't get the software.All the keys on this KB can be customized and it can be used in conjunction with your primary keyboard. Even though this KB ain't full size and you don't have all the keys on it. The software will register the keys you press on your full size/primary keyboard which then can be mapped on this KB. Let me give you a key sequence that I use for copying data from the browser to my excel sheet -Ctrl+ACtrl+CAlt+TabF2Ctrl+VEnterAlt+TabAll these seven commands can be mapped on just one key and ease your work flow, thereby saving you time. The software isn't as good as Logitech GHub software but is usable.There aren't many videos online that shed light on the process of recording maros. Here's how to do it -Say, you want to map the copy command (Ctrl+C) on G1 Macro key or any other key and I mean ANY KEY.Go to Macro, then press Record . Press Ctrl once and then press C. Don't press it simultaneously like you usually would. Press one after another.Your keystrokes should look like this:Ctrl (down arrow)Ctrl (up arrow)C (down arrow)C(up arrow)Rearrange them to:Ctrl (down arrow)C (down arrow)Ctrl (up arrow)C(up arrow)Down Arrow - When you press a keyUp Arrow - When you release a keyThe process is the same for all other commands. It is easy and you'll get a hang of it when you explore the software.The only thing I didn't like about this keyboard are its keycaps. I am not a gamer so couldn't stand the sight of those fonts/legends on the caps. So I polished them using a fine grit sandpaper, sprayed a coat of primer and then sprayed my desired color.Conclusion: This is an excellent device if you're looking for a macro keypad. Can come handy for graphic designers, video editors, programmers or anyone who's into advanced excel."
5,I am usingbthis keyboard with my ps4 for warzone. Just used it for an hour now and i can tell its good. Buttons are good and responsive. Some reviews said they dont like the placement of the space bar but for me its just perfect. I was previusly using a zebronics max pro mechanical keyboard for gaming and i dont know why but there was definitely a lag in my my keystrokes and player movement but this redragon is goood and fast.. i havent downloadedbthe app and customised it. But i can reccomend it to anyone for gaming...just go for it..and yes the wrist support attachment is also grt.
2,Rather than buying this product buy a 60% mechanical or optical keyboard by HK gaming GK61 which is rs4000 and you can choose varieties of keys and switches configurations and those switches are hot-swappable also. The reason I am advising you not to buy this keyboard is because of the space bar configuration and also the overall size of the keyboard. The one-handed keyboard may look compact buy because of those side macros and top and bottom buttons this keyboard takes quite a lot of space in the table.
4,"Redragon may seem like a cheap chinese brand, the product is quite nice. It is sturdy and well built. The USB C port is convenient and pass through power is useful but slow. Keycaps are comfortable but larger ones are not very stable. Switches are decent but blue is not the best for gaming. They don’t sound great and quite different from cherry blues. But at this price I’m not complaining. Wrist rest is extremely well made with magnets and good design. There are 4 presets for lighting and are decent. Macros are a little far and so is the space key. The worst thing is the software though. It is unusual and I cannot customise the macros or lighting. Macros are just f1, f2 … keys so it is easy to map it in the games controls. But since the software is not part of the product, I’m giving it a 4 star for very nice value for money"
5,Absolutely loving this keypad. The keys give a nice feedback and you can change the color profiles on the go. So you have 4 profiles and you can set each key differently in all the profiles. I am using this keypad on console. No problem recording macro.The only downside is that macros does not register mouse keys. And the G1 macro is positioned in a very awkward and uncomfortable place.
4,Good solid keyboard. Good for Gaming too. Switches are bit too noisy aa they are blue switches. The problem with this is that space key is difficult to adapt to.
4,"product as described.i would recommend this product only for1) laptop users2) who dont have space for a full size keyboard OR3) looking for something more portable than a fullsize keyboard.key switches sound and feel nice but are a bit loud. the position of the spacebar is probably the biggest disadvantage with this keyboard. You have to really stretch out your thumb to reach it compared to a normal keyboard. It will take some getting used to (my thumb muscles were paining for a couple of days).All in all, an amazing product for its price."
5,Best ever keyboard for gaming too swift and smooth and it works just like normal big size gaming keyboard so don't worry about that but one handed gives u best experience !!!!
5,"An excellent product from Redragon.It is a one handed gaming mechanical key pad.Can be used for productivity as well.A very versatile product.All buttons except the profile and record buttons are mechanical switches.Outemu blue switches.You also get a key cap puller as well as a key switch puller, with an additional 4 key switches.Hot swappable key switches, fits most standard key switches.The wrist rest attaches with magnets and was kinda loose for me but eh🤷🤷, it's attached with magnets.Comes with a braided USB type C cable and has a USB pass through as well.Overall a very good product."
5,"Blue switches - gives tactile clicks, amazing for gamingRGB options are greatBit bigger, with the additional magnetic support, just what the gamers asked for.Type C cable with additional USB 2.0 is  really good.Overall total value for money"
3,"This thing is great for gaming and the software is functional though lacks a lot. My problem is with the seller packaging it poorly and Amazon delivery handling it poorly as well. I had to replace, return and reorder it to finally receive an undamaged acceptable product. Take that for a gauge of how much I liked it."

Caps lock, Numlock etc. Since it is wireless, need to have On/Off switch to conserve battery.. missing in both keyboard and mouse.Edit on 04-Aug-2020 :Space Key gets stuck in keyboard and space character gets repeated.. unable to use at all."
1,"Utter waste of money.  Both the key board and mouse started malfunctioning after just three weeks of use. Bought this thinking that HP is a reputed brand, and can be trusted.  Now I understand that HP is a brand that cannot be trusted any more. and I see that many of my friends are of same opinion. What they say is that, now a days HP has became an untrustworthy brand."
1,"Low quality build for keyboard and mouse. Indicators are not working for Num, CAPS lock.Design of Keys are not good!Not worthy to buy !"
5,"This is a very good basic keyboard, keys are sturdy and very comfortable to write for long duration. The overall size of the keyboard is compact and ideal for smaller workstations. The wi-fi receiver is plug & play and very responsive. Mouse is bit flimsy but works very well. At its price point it is value for money. The only drawback is lack of Back-lit Keys but I can live without it as I use it only when I am working with my laptop at my workstation."
1,My mouse started malfunctioning after using a month. The right-click button triggers wheel functionality and the left click triggers right-click functionality. It feels impossible to contact the service center and after continuously trying for an hour the customer care suggested me to go to a service center as online support for accessories is not provided.

Please Guys Give Such Attentions to This Conditions."
5,Keyboard and mouse works perfectly fine. Finger impression on the keys makes typing comfortable. CAPS key indicator not required since laptop has CAPS LOCK light indication. Mouse is super smooth and efficient.
1,Low rating for ridiculous services from HP.1st they send defective mouse.In replacement they sent broker key board with no battery cover backside.Wasted lot of time & looks like selling used product.
5,"Keys are smooth, Low sound clicks. Mouse clicks are irritating usually but this one had it's own mechanism not to play any sound with mouse clicks. you'll love it when you use it.The best option i loved it auto power of, to save battery, you need to press a key to wake it up as simple as that...Awesome benefit with battery indicator just above the number key padImprovement, It's better to Numlock, Caps lock & Scroll lock indicators on Keyboard"
3,"What is wrong with you Amazon? At first I received a completely ramshackle package. There was no battery, the mouse was loose. And this is not the first time this happened. But today I will write.The mouse scroll wheel turned out to be broken, and the keyboard was definitely a used one.I requested a return, and the new one I just now received is a new pack, I broke the seal of it. There were batteries, and the keyboard was completely fresh. I have been your customer since you were not in India! And you do this to your old customers. What do you think of yourself? You have become too big, eh?BTW, your competitor takes time to deliver stuff, but never does these cheap thrills.Coming to the keyboard, it is an average product. The mouse is light and uncomfortable to use. Avoid if you can. Buy Logitech, any product. I should have."
1,The keyboard looks and feel cheap (almost like a duplicate). The plastic finish is not smooth at all. Anyways started using it but to my horror the functionality was even worse. Few keys won't respond on single hit and few registers twice or thrice on single hit. Such a huge disappointment. Finally decided to change the keyboard but to my shock there is only a replacement option. I will have to find out if the replacement is better if not this item could get stuck in replacement request loop forever.
1,"I've complaint about the defected keyboard I received which was not working and the customer care executive assured me about the replacement with three working days, but even after 4 days I haven't received the keyboard and now it shows that I can not get refund or replace the same. I'm a very frequent customer of Amazon and this is the first time I'm facing this problem. It seems that Amazon also doing the same tactics like other e-commerce organisations doing after getting the payment. Even then I request the Amazon once again to replace the product at the earliest."
4,I’m writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. My work involves an extensive usage of mouse and few keyboard taps. So after 3 weeks of usage I find the mouse scroll has a squeaky noise when in scroll up or down. This kind of noise is usually expected may be after 6-7 months of heavy usage.Pros:1. Comfortable grip on holding the mouse and keyboard taps.2. No lagCons:1. Mouse scroll is squeaking2. Not value for the money3. Not a good build quality
1,"Completely disappointed with this product and never expected from HP, such a low quality product.After a week keys gets harder to type and literally feel pain and also ever week u need to change battery in the Mouse and holding mouse a myth, it pains there as well."
1,After some day mouse scroll wheel broken and when i caim for warranty its show that not covered warranty. Really pathetic situation. Previous i use Logitech mouse for more than 3 yr but no issues. But in this product issue is there i asked one of my friend he also brought that and facing the same issue. Plz don't buy
5,With work from home in full effect I needed dual screens and it was necessary to use the laptop as a screen. With this combo I was able to do that and have the freedom to use the keyboard and mouse free from the laptop. The keyboard is smooth and responsive and the mouse is small but powerful and responsive. The best part is that the mouse shuts off if not used for a certain period of time.
1,"I purchased this some 6 weeks back. It suddenly stopped working. My laptop ( even tried with other laptops) is not detected it now. For last 1 week , it was disconnecting  frequently now it completely stopped.Now sure how to fix issue ."
5,I read few negative comments regarding the product. I find it to be awesome till now. If there be any negative finding i will update my review. till date it works fine without any flaw. For notification of CAPS LOCK and NUM Lock i use a software called 'TrayStatus' it works for me
5,Pros:Sturdy KB and mouseNo click sound for mouseAuto off feature works well (for conserving energy); Just scroll the mouse button to reactivateCons:No inidcators for Capslock/Numlock
1,"No indicator for caps lock, num lock.From first month itself space bar and control key was too jam to operate. In 2-3 month space bar key stopped functioning. Waste of money."
3,"Liked the key design, mouse fills the palm ... Grips well. Didn't likebtwo things no switch off button on keyboard in case you want to clean it ... Mouse detection range fluctuates . sometimes doesn't detect so need to move close the transmitter on dekstop."
1,"Quality not good, no value for moneyBoth mouse and keyboard do not have On/Off switches which makes it difficult. Keypad sensitivity is not great. Mouse scroll wheel got busted within two months. Overall not a quality product"
4,Both keyboard and mouse have a soft feel when using. The mouse buttons are exceptionally buttery and feels good to use.Grooves in keyboard reduce typos but it could have used a palm rest
4,"Overall a nice combo of keyboard and mouse from HP.Pros: Keys are soft and easy to use.  Typing and playing games effortlessly.Cons: Power off/on provision is not in either keyboard or in mouse.However, not happy with delivery by courier service. They delivered my package break opened but luckily items are not damaged."
5,Gud product
4,Keyboard seems to be slow in communicating with the laptop. Battery in keyboard drains very fast  but mouse doesn't drain the battery fast.
4,Good combo with affordable pricing. One observation was sometimes the click is not responding for our actions
2,"The keyboard is advertised as multi device and MacBook compatible, BUT, does not work well with the MacBook. The Number Pad does not work with the Mac and the function keys are not compatible."
5,Good keyboard and mouse with automatic power on and off
1,Please help in using this mouse. It doesn't work properly. Very bad  mouse experience it not at all easy to use  . It pointer doesn't come up when we click at once. No click sound is there on mouse. And don'twork on every surface..
2,First product I received had a defective mouse so I asked for replacement even the replacement have a defective mouse
5,I order total 3 times this for all members of my family. Good price and very smooth performance light weight and also use far distance.
1,"Wrong description of product, neither slim nor have dpi/cpi switch on mouse.Description is of ho slim keyboard of ₹1599 and product showing is cs 10"
2,Absolutely worthless product to buy.Although delivered within 24hrs of ordering. The product had innumerous glitches and software problems right from the time it was attached with the laptop. The cursor started malfunctioning and draining the batteries within blink of an eye.DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
4,Keyboard and mouse is good quality and responsive. You will feel while pressing the keys of the keyboard. The only demerit I noticed is lack of indicators for Caps Lock and other locks.
1,"Within 3 months my mouse's scroller stopped working.Customer service response was as cheap as it can be.Service centres denied accepting product through courier, where I am ready to bear courier expense too.I don't recommend this product to anyone especially online."
5,Very nice product at this price Must buy for gaming and work form home purpose
4,Good sturdy and perfect with MAC as well.Only fault is that there r  NO LED indicators to know if caps or scroll is ON.
5,Wonderful product cheaper than what you get in park lane Hyderabad and many places here . Go for it.
5,This keyboard cover is best for Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 (2021 model) .Best typing experience and doesn't have any gaps or looseness.
4,Perfect fit for lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3. But price should be less. Around ₹200 would be perfect deal.
5,Fit nicely in IdeaPad gaming 3 keyboardNice qualityVisibility through it is okay
4,its costly but cheaper than other brands of the same catergory .......
1,No soft no comfort no use
2,"Product is average as compared to cost, what more we can expect from the buyer. Not suitable for long lasting life"
5,"Exact measurements and good fit to my table, premium look and feel."
5,"Exact measurements and good fit to my table, premium look and feel."
1,"With great reviews on YouTube and everyone talking about this keyboard, I hastily bought it cause it is my first mechanical keyboard and I was overjoyed. It offered great switches and build quality for a low price which was its selling point but one grave mistake led me to write this review, I forgot to check the reviews on Amazon and noticed a lot of people have the double or even triple entry for a single key problem and sometimes unable to use it at all which I am facing right now. It was a great keyboard while it worked with great feeling and being compact too which added to the overall gaming feel but after some months of usage I noticed the double-entry problem and looked upon the internet for answers but it seemed like most people were facing the same problem as me so, I looked and noticed some forums about keeping the keys dust-free as it will hinder the mechanism so, cleaned it really well but it made no difference after a week of use as the same problem arose. I cleaned it once more and the problem still arose and now I am stuck with a useless keyboard whose wasd and some other keys don’t work at all which is the biggest problem since I can’t play at all. So, my suggestion would be to get the Logitech G413 keyboard which costs around 5500 with a discount and uses the same keys as its higher expensive models but cut down in a certain area to reduce the cost. My suggestion is to please read the reviews on Amazon as it is the place that will give a glimpse of how this keyboard is while other places do not offer it at all. I am not certain if everyone has the problem or only a select few such as me who is unlucky but it hasn’t worked well for me considering after spending almost 5k and it didn’t last more than 6 months."
1,"The product arrived on time and the packaging was sufficient.The product itself is an attempt by Redragon to introduce affordable gaming products into the market. First impression when the box is opened, is the weight and the build quality. This keyboard is built well and does not reflect its price. In terms of build quality, it compares to other mechanical keyboards that are twice as expensive. The footprint of the keyboard on the desk is akin to the Apple Keyboard without the numpad, the F keys double as media keys. The keys themselves are similar to the Cherry MX Green with a nice feel and tactile response, even though the product does not use Cherry MX. The gaming experience is superb and ghosting or double presses are completely absent. In summation, the keyboard is definitely worth the price and is a stepping stone to the world of mechanical keyboards.There is only one drawback, that is more of a personal preference and does not reflect on the build quality. The Redragon logo is horrendous and I intend to wet-sand it away, also, the LED colors are locked to red, I'd have liked the option to change that. However, these 'drawbacks' are personal and do not reflect on the excellent quality of the keyboard.Edit: Turns out that after a week of use, the N key is registering a triple entry. Have asked for replacement, I hope this is a one off issue. Bringing down by a star because of double presses.Edit 2: After 10 days of use, the entire keyboard turned defective. N, 9, Ctrl, Esc started registering double presses. Serious design flaw. Replacement was delivered today, shall edit the post after review.Edit 3: The replacement piece was fine for exactly 2 days and thereafter the 1 key and the D key started registering double presses. In conclusion, this keyboard has great build quality but the actual functioning is rubbish. Sent the replacement back today and claimed for a refund. Ordered the Logitech K840 instead.DO NOT BUY."
5,"I am using it with MacBook and it's awesome. the typing experience is awesome. red switches are awesome and sound great. the keyboard is heavy as expected, a very solid keyboard. I get it for 2890.after reading so many negative comments or maybe it's true, maybe some people have a bad experience but the company did a great job of making this true mechanical keyboard at this price point. and also it looks beautiful. I recommend it 100%. my experience is so far so good.NOTE- after lubrication, it runs like an expensive mechanical keyboard ... so do lubricate it to make your experience smoothermy condolences to the people who get the defective pieces .... amazon and the seller should look into this matter."
4,"I've used CosmicByte CB-GK 12, and I recently bought AntEsports MK3400W (And returned it). Is one is by far the best mech keyboard I've used. Wayyyy better than the other 2 i've Used/Tested.There was no seal on the box, Keyboard was poorly packed and one of the keys came out of it's socket and was rumbling inside the box when it arrived. So it was obviously a returned product. Decided to keep it since I did not notice any issues with the keyboard.All the blue switches are consistent and make the same sound. which wasn't the case with my previous keyboards.The keyboard feels a lot sturdier and heavier than the previous ones.Keycaps are well finished and don't have any rough edges, AntEsports MK3400W had horrible quality keycaps.No Numpad, Which is a plus for me because i have a small desk and i play games on higher than average DPIs.Rubber feet on all 4 sides. CosmicByte one had only 2 while antesports had none so the keyboard kept slipping and moving on the desk.Height can be increased with the 2 risers in the bottom like all keyboards, But they're of very good quality and are spring loaded, which gives a satisfying and premium feel to the keyboard.Keyboard has On-Board memory. Every light mode you set will stay after you shut down the pc and turn back on. none of my previous keyboards had this.No companion app but you can illuminate individual keys on the keyboard via some key combinations. This is a huge feature in this price range.Cable is not braided. both cosmicbyte and antesports had braided keyboards.KeyCap puller, Manual and a Redragon logo sticker is included with the keyboard, which is nice!All the keys are well lit under max brightness. Some keys like PageUp, PageDown don't look good if you set the brightness all the way down.Mine didn't come with Hot swapable switches. but my friend has the same exact keyboard which was bought 3 years ago, it has hot swapable switches which means switches are easier to replace if one or 2 are faulty and you also have the freedom of replacing the switches to brown or red switches if needed."
5,"Fantastic packaging. Pricing is good, a tad more expensive than the TVS Gold ( the gold standard of affordable mechanical keyboards till date). Amazon did screw me with the pricing though, offering a 500 Rs discount after i bought the keyboard at 4k. Apart from that, the backlighting is fantastic with good quality and extremely useful during those late night sessions on the computer.Lets get to the meat of the keyboard. Feedback and the ""thunk"" is WAY better than the TVS Gold. The keys, i think travel a bit less, but I find it a lot faster to type on this. The sound is more solid, wrt to the Gold. The backplate is solid and hefty, offering a good planted feel, once you extend the rubberized feet, is really hard to displace. The connector wire is again of very good quality.  I really love the quality of this keyboard.For long, there was no other choice in the sub 5k mechanical KB category apart from the TVS Gold. The Kumara upends this with a solid alternative, that offers the minimum required features without the excessive price from the likes of Corsair, Cooler Master, Das etc. If you are on a budget and are looking for a mechanical KB, your first choice should be this one."
1,"I bought this keyboard. On arrival, I found that one entire row of keys was not functioning (the number keys row including backspace key) so I asked for a replacement. The replacement arrived 2 days later. Initially, everything was fine, I was enjoying typing on the keyboard and it seemed to be of good quality. Less than 24 hours later, the left-shift key stopped working. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and instead of asking for another replacement I asked for a refund. I don't want to use a keyboard that could break at any moment and looking at different reviews, it seems I am not the only one who is suffering from such problems. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this keyboard. There's a good chance it'll break within 2-3 months of usage."
5,"This is my first mechanical keyboard, and I am enjoying it a lot. The keyboard and the keys were all in good shape when it arrived. The keyboard has very low deck flex. At first I thought the RGB zones will not look as good as per-key RGB. But it is really good in my opinion. I am using it for my gaming and programming use. I will definitely recommend it.Pros:- Really good value for money- Impressive quality- Good Switches (Outemu Red)- Sounds niceCons:- No per-key RGB- No detachable USB cable- Some people experienced double key press issue"
1,The D key doesn’t work after 2 weeks of use.I don’t even know whom to contactThe customer care is always busy
4,"I am using it for programming purpose, I haven’t tried it for gaming but it’s absolutely awesome in use for my purpose.It’s built quality is brilliant and the response on key press is also very smooth.Board size is perfect for any desk and it’s form factor is comfortable for typing usage.Just go for it."
5,"I've used a TVS mechanical keyboard so far, the buttons require a bit more load, but I really enjoy typing on it and the convenience of lesser keys. I feel this one slows down my typing a little bit, but it makes it a great experience overall. I'm no longer rushing with the typing tempo and enjoying the greater feed back on each finger."
5,"I used to have a TVS gold keyboard way before i even knew what a mechanical keyboard was. After it broke and typing on many other keyboards, I felt they lacked the 'feel' I was expecting when I typed.After researching, bought this as my first mech keyboard. I love it so far. It feels well built, and tho not cherry MX (let's get real, you can't expect cherries at this price) the outemu blues used in these give me the 'feel' I want while typing. Though, the clacking of the blues might me annoying to few.The keyboard has no RGB, only red but comes with many diff light effects to choose from. I personally don't use them, played around with them the first few days and that's it.It's been north of 2 months now and the only issue I have is the ping sound when I type. It's the ringing sound of the spring when the key gets pressed down. Usually I wear headphones but otherwise it's noticeable if you listen to it keenly.I've read it can be removed by oiling the spring, but I havent tried anything yet."
4,i used to use a membrane keyboard when i bought this i was shocked by how good the quality was i would recommend anyone to buy this and not spend a fortune reall worth the money red switches aare great the keyboard is a little heavy cuz of its build quality.. rgb options bleww me away 100% wortth the money !! buy it! ( some letter double typing cuz the actuation is low and after using membrane keyboard this requires little time to type properly)
2,I bought this product less than two months ago due to good reviews on YouTube and Amazon but one week ago the shift key stopped working properly. Sometimes the key would register and sometimes it would not. This affected my typing and gameplay. Then a few days back it became worse as the key would rarely register. So I tried to search for warranty and said there is warranty for 1 year but there are no service center’s in india so it was basically useless. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because for the brief 2 months I used this it was very good.
1,I bought this keyboard based on the reviews for this one. Within 5 months of using this i started facing problems of sometimes not responding and the backlighting of 3 of my keys are not lighting up. I contacted the customer care for because it was under 1 yr and the warranty holds up and they told me to courier the keyboard to mumbai which would cost me around 700. I mean what kind of warranty is that where i need to pay more for the bad quality of their product. I strongly recommend cosmic byte mechanical keyboard because if somthing happens they will come to your house to collect the keyboard or just save up your money and buy a ducky one 2 mini or any better mechanical keyboard rather than these.
5,I bought this because my previous Logitech wireless keyboard started giving problems like key getting stuck and hard just within year. This mechanical keyboard works like a charm even after one year no issues. Build quality is awesome. Worth a buy. It does not hurt fingers even after day long usage...
5,"Awesome for fast typing. Has a very nice feel and sound to it. My typing speed upped from average 50 to 90 since i bought this keyboard. One problem is that the light from a few keys fades after a while. It's been a month since i bought mine and the alt and del keys do not light up anymore. But i don't really care about backlights so it doesn't bother me that much. Also, they keycaps are not that great in quality, and frequent use of the provided keycap remover will cause scratches and dents in the sides of the keycaps."
5,"For what its worth this is a great keyboard. The keys feel really good the sound is also nice but its funny that the keyboard is heavier than my laptop. It has absolutely no flex the build quality is solid. The lights are satisfactory there are lots of mode and you can create new modes using the instructions. The fact that its software does not work in windows 10 is a downside I dont know if it works in other operating systems,overall great quality didn't this much from a keyboard this cheap to be honest."
4,First of all in India 3000 isn’t a small amount. Well some of u might say it’s budget keyboard but for middle class families its not so budgetly. The build quality is good. The keycaps are not okay at all. I mean they could do a lot better. And oh btw the hollow sound in the new keyboards are due to the springs inside them. One u used it for a while it will go away. Overall the keyboard is pretty good but it has room for improvement.
5,"The product is exceptionally well built for the price and has virtually no deck flex. It's also doean't take up much space on the desk and is pretty compact, it's even smaller than my Razer Blackwidow. The keys feel tactile and have a satisfying click to them and are even individually lit, though are all red.The only gripe i have is the non-removable cable.Overall, great keyboard."
1,Received damaged item even after getting a replacement.I first received the product the with a missing ESC keycap. I ordered a replacement which also was quality wise not acceptable with the E key RGB not lighting up and the product seal was broken with the keyboard facing the wrong way.
4,"It's very good for gaming and the built quality is also fantastic. I really like to type on this, even while gaming at late night it doesn't bother my parents sleeping next room.ConVery less effects"
1,Don’t buy this. First month it was doing just fine. Then came the problems. Key “E” is not working properly. Keys “I” and “M” keeps double clicking. The keyboard is not sturdy. And the keys does not feel that good. Don’t buy this instead spend another 1.5 k and buy Logitech mechanical keyboard.
3,"Having so many postive reviews on Amazon and youtube, i thought this was really a good keyboard, well the build quality is really good, the CherryMX equivalent outemu red keys also feel really good, but what I don't like about this keyboard is the latency which is around 25ms, for comparison hyperx keyboards have around 5ms, so when you try to ccounter strafe on games like csgo and valorant it feels really sluggish. Refunded this keyboard, gonna save for a better one."
5,Great keyboard for the price really good build quality almost no deck flex really good look although the legend could've been a little better it's a gamery look which I don't like otherwise great keyboard backlight is bright which helps working in dark
4,It's outtemu Red switchesI think it's hotswappableIt comes with a keycap pullerIt provides both nice typing experience and gaming experience since you don't have to put too much effort while pressing the switches...The connection is permanent and not usb CThe backlighting is actually nice it does comes with some good modesThe size is really small so you'll have more than enough desk space compared to a 100% keyboard
2,"So I got this product once , the keyboard was looking fine. But when I plugged in , the RBG lighting was fine but the entire keys in the row QWERTY didn't work. So I had to return and replace it with the same keyboard. I now have the replaced one and I've been using this for 2 mnths and now my ""E"" key isn't responding well. I press 4 times and it read only once and now I can't return and my 3k spent on this goes whoosh into the void."
1,WASDQ buttons all have become near unresponsive to register without applying double the force than that of a membrane keyboard. It is a dust magnet. Require a refund or replacement as this is this unacceptable for spending so much money
5,"I did have the same keyboard but the mechanical version, this does not seem to be a mechanical one. Which is what I like most. Typing is so confortable and without the noise of a mechanical keyboard.Looks like my search for the perfect keyboard for my programming is over. Fantastic."
5,"It's a very good quality product, I liked it so much, it gives the best performance, outstanding sturdiness, minimum key noise, very good backlit and the most important thing, It's highly comfortable. I highly recommend this product if you have low budget. Thank you and have a good day. ❤️"
3,"Amazon had delivered this gaming keyboard in exact time and i was very excited to play games on my new gaming keyboard. During first 15 days it worked perfectly fine but after that the keys from 3rd columns i.e Tab, Q, W, E, R, T, Y.......... stops working.. And after some time it again starts working. some times it stops responding for whole days.  I don't know what is wrong."
1,key 'v' is not working after one month. Bdw this review is typed with another keyboard. So mchu frustrated
1,"The keyboard is good, if only it worked properly. A complete row of keys stopped working less than 2 weeks after I started using it. Would not recommend."
1,"Do not buy redragon products, this keyboard is cheap and faulty. There is no service offered by the company and amazon is falsifying warranty claims on this, there is no warranty if you get a defective product."
2,Delivered a used one ...Did not expect from this Amazon...!The second time mice is not working useless brand checking ...
5,"Productive purpose really good, typing experience really good and also good at all aspects"
5,"Value for money, keyboard keys feels amazing while typing does not make much noise like other keyboards and mouse works smoothly. No complaints at all. Also, mouse has a compartment to place the receiver so it doesn’t get lost. Lastly, mouse turns off itself after 8 minutes to save battery. You can wake the mouse by just a click. Overall it's worth of the money you are paying."
3,"Don't know about the built quality, but keyboard and mouse is looking good. Bought for learning fast typing, I hope it will be suitable for me. Currently no issues"
5,"Thin and small size light noiseless keyboard mouse with thin keyboard screen and numeric key. Easy to carry in backpack.Good keyboard, gives you laptop keyboard like feel. Good response if you keep the wireless received close to the keyboard , but if you move the receiver a bit far the response becomes immediately sluggish. As an example moving the wireless dongle from one side to other side of my mac changed the responsiveness of this keyboard drastically."
5,Best for the price
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. ITS A CHEAP CHINESE PRODUCT.. I bought and half of the keys are not working.. ones which are working makes u break ur fingers..
5,Very user friendly 😍 it has keyboard cover also.
5,I Have a enjoyed This product
1,Battery exhausts itself rapidly because there is no sleep mode. Mouse is too small and your wrist will start to hurt. Don't buy it.
5,"The keyboard protector works as advertised. It's great to block out dust particles from entering the keyboard, it has a soft touch and it cancels out the typing noise of the keyboard. The transparent protector which I purchased is also good for the backlit keyboard of the HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073tx for which also it fits perfectly. The only difference between 14-ba075tx and 14-ba073tx is the CPU, rest everything is same. I've been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I am quite satisfied with it. I purchased this from Amazon at Rs. 355. I'm sure it might be available in local shops for a cheaper price but Amazon provides service and replacement (in case of wrong product, etc) which local shop owners are not able to provide. Also, almost every time I enquired locally, it was not available in shops and they advised me to buy it online."
5,"My Problem;Actually speakers were just above keyboard (1 cm) and same with the trackpad. That's why a standard silicon cover was not suitable; which was either covering speakers or half of my trackpad. It's a great product if you have the same problem.For quality;I'll say you'll like naked keyboard instead of the cover, but any cover has the same problem. Overall it's awesome as my first impressions.My Review ?? Why;Actually wrote this review for typing test with cover, I'll say pretty impressive. :)Scope of Improvement;If touch experience could have been better I would 4x the amount of my purchase but sadly only 1 quality is available.I'm having a 14"" hp dk00093."
5,"Pretty good. It will fit all Pavilion x360 14inch laptops and also 14inch HP notebooks.I liked it. It fits ON the keys, and stays there. Good adhesion. But I'm not sure how it will stay if you fold your laptop and then use it roughly. It will stay stuck, but due to rough use, it might not stay for long. I have put tapes on the short sides of it. But It should have at least sticky/adhesive corners."
4,Its design is super fit.Great visibility of keys.Never interact (press) with other keys while typing.Moreover good product for this price.You can check my photos I fixed with it.
4,Bought it for HP x360 convertible laptop and fits perfectly. Unlike many other 'flat' keyboard covers this one doesn't fall off when the laptop is used in tablet mode. It's transparent nature ensures that backlit keyboard is visible in low light. Overall a good keyboard cover.
3,It is as good as plastic if i would put plastic instead of it than it will be same not adhesive as should be and it is not fit as it should be it is coming out again and again .And I have sat this again and again . Not satisfied at all. Tad it is soft but in case of protection you can just put plastic wrap instead of it.
2,The product quality is good and fits my 14inch hp lap well. But the prize is a little high(i got it for rs365) and the material is not much adhesiive. After using it for a month-it was seen that there is gaps forming. Now it is not that fitting properly.
4,Adhesive gum (like we get along with ATM cards in the pack) must be provided along with it.Its feathers must extend beyond the keys so that we can apply the adhesive gum.
4,"A very useful product for those who are more into writing from laptop keyboard. Prevents dusts to enter into the gaps. Adhesion is goos but the borders are a little bit lifted at some places, but that doesn't causing any problem.Price is a bit high I feel, but obviously a good product available online."
4,"I liked the product. Good quality skin and it sits snugly(almost) on my 15 inch HP Envy 2020. I took a gamble by ordering this since it is mentioned for 13"" but kt was worth it. Although I believe price is little bit on the higher side."
5,It fits perfectly to the Pavilion Notebook. However the adhesion is not upto the mark. The edges peel off with the slightest touch or pull.
5,Saco Products never Disappoints....Value for Money 💰....Thankyou Amazon 💯👍
5,"Perfect fit. Does the job well. Had got the black one sent by mistake , requested for the transparent one. Replaced promptly. Maybe I Will update review after a few months..."
4,"Got the product delivered on time. Fits my keyboard well, only issue is the space bar key doesn't fit in will due to which it becomes loose a bit. Overall good product."
5,"Worth it. There's no dust that can go between the keys, which saves us a lot of issues. This is highly recommended for people that sweat on their palms as it provides great friction. Ensure to clean it often."
1,After 4 months button C and V are out of fit now it causing issue in eyes when seeing these numbersSo surely it is not a good product.
5,Good quality and fits exactly as described.Before buying please go through the instructions

1,Purchased the keyboard skin by more positive reviews on this product. But the skin dosen't fit for my hp 14-dv series laptop. Observed lot of gaps at the edges.
1,cover do not fit properly on the keypad. So you cannot use the keyboard putting it on your keyboard.
5,Fits perfectly on keyboard it does not slip while typing highly recommend
3,This item was unfit for hp pavilion 14dv-0054tuIt's size is so smaller than laptop keyboard
5,Perfect fit for my laptop keyboard. No slipping and moving while typing. Price is a little high though.
5,Awesome productGo for itPerfect fitMy Laptop is looking smart now
4,nice can buy it
5,Perfect fit for 14 InchesIf you are looking for 14 Inches Laptop just go for it.
4,"The keyboard itself deserves 5 stars for the it's build quality and feature functionality like RGB customization, Force Actuation customization and smart-display that can be configured to display system information like Temperatures or Clock speed.To top it all off, the keyboard comes with a magnetic wrist-pad and the keys are very satisfying to type/game on.The only problem is the pricing. The keyboard should cost around Rs 17000 post GST (I paid 19000 on a lightning deal) but regular pricing is nearly double that amount."
2,"So I got this keyboard for INR 9,999 during a sale on the MSRP of ~INR 18k. This is not worth the price at all, let me explain.Software is not great. This keyboard is advertised that it has Macro key binds on the M1-M6 keys but the software has no option to map them, so it's a backend issue which hasn't been fixed since a long time. That's speaks a lot about a company since fixing this is not Rocket Science. Don't buy it for this reason alone, OLED display is a cheap DIY build, if that's your USP for getting Apex 5.Build Quality is great, no issues.Material used are not that great, the OLED screen gets scratched soo easily even if you only wipe it with a dry Micro Fibre cloth.The keykaps are a fingerprint magnet, all the oil from your skin will be very visible and is not at all pleasing.Cleaning this keyboard is difficult.The switches are hybrid, but I am not impressed. Reason is some keystrokes are registered before the audible mechanical click while some keystrokes are registered after the mechanical click. So some keys even if not pressed beyond the mechanical click, still register which is not great considering the price and I am very light on my touch.Overall I would not pay anything above INR 7k for this product for what it's worth, 18k is a rip-off if you can't even get together a Software Team to fix product breaking bugs for more than an year.Don't recommend getting this at the price asked for, just get a TVS Gold, this one's not worth it."
5,"This is true love. The keyboard is perfect and I have nothing negative to say about it.What I love the most: - the sexy red keys - the steelseries software to control the keyboard (it also allows you to match the backlight to your music) - the little OLED screen which I use to display my CPU specs and temperature - the beautiful magnetic wrist restThis is the first time I've spent a good chunk of money on a keyboard and I don't regret it one bit. The experience has been phenomenal so far.Will update my review after a month or so, but I doubt I'll have anything negative to report."
5,Good keyboard loved it prompt delivery bought it from appario retail sellet
5,"you cannot go wrong with this. Touch, the sound is something unique and the hand rest pad provides rich and nice support. My first mechanical keyboard."
1,"Guys let me get straight to the point if you guys want the most premium keyboard in the world then you should not buy the Steelseries apex pro TKL , the reason being that this is a TKL which costs the same as Corsair K100 RGB .Latency wise - Corsair K100 RGB > Apex pro TKLBuild quality - Corsair K100 RGB > Apex pro TKLSwitches wise we can give an edge to the apex pro TKL as we can adjust the actuation but if you are looking for the best keyboard with the lowest latency possible then Corsair K100 beats the apex pro TKL [ source : Rtings ]Apex pro TKL has a gimmicky OLED screen and Corsair has got a Multifunctional Wheel which when compared to OLED screen is better IRLCorsair costs just 1K more than Apex pro TKL but you are getting NUMPAD , better switches which are way faster than omnipoints  , 4000 Hz polling rate  and if you update K100 you get 8000 Hz polling rate , better wrist rest , Nice Double shot PBT keycaps .If you want the best premium keyboard in the world get the Corsair K100 RGB with OPX switches not the Cherry MX ones [ as Cherry MX feel worse in comparison with OPX ]Wanna enjoy changing Actuation point of you switches ? Wanna show off OLED screen on your keyboard ? Need more space to move your mouse ? Get the Steelseries Apex Pro TKLPeace out 😶‍🌫️"
5,its the best gaming keyboard i have ever uuuuuuussssseed!!!! If you have money buy this for sure blindly!!!!..Best Keyboard ever...
5,Good one  I didn't buy it but I am writing review lol it fun to right review everything ha ha
5,"If one is having a 15.6 inch laptop specially HP brand then go for it without any hesitation .Pros - 1. Colour and print is best 👍🏻  2. Fits perfectly in the keyboard  3. Cheaper from any seller in  Amazon right now with great  quality.  4. Packaging is best .*No Cons(Check images for quality , not sponsored by the way , i have purchased with own money 😅)Thanks to the seller ."
4,"This comes in three different colors (Rainbow, black and transparent). First i bought the black one then i changed that and took the transparent one (below i explained why i choose the transparent one over the black one)Pros:- The transparent one is very very thin (exactly as the description, maybe 0.6 mm), fits perfectly on my HP 15S-DR3500X laptop, it so perfect fitting that at first look you won't be able to spot the keyboard cover whether it is there or not, look at the pictures i attached for more confirmation.Cons:- It fits perfectly, but the product is very very lightweight, so it was coming off when i was some air over it, but i don't think it's a big deal, becauy as soon as i stopped blowing air it was going back to its normal position immediately, other than this i didn't find any big issues.Reason for not choosing the black one:- The black one have same fitting and thickness, but the black one was blocking the light of my backlit keyboard, Of course the cover has keys printed on the keyboard which is clearly visible in normal lighting conditions, but in dark when you will light up the keyboard then the cover will block the light coming from keys. Thats why i preffered the transparent one over the black one.And i haven't tested the Rainbow one, so can't speak about that. Do your won research before buying."
5,It is beyond my expectations..The product is super cool and perfectly fits on my laptop. It gives your laptop a premium look and also protects the dust to enter in the keywords.
5,"This product is very much useful. It perfectly fits into my laptop. Unless you say someone no one is going to notice it. Very thin and light weight. No issue while typing. However price is something high. But never mind, it is supposed to do its job.Any one can go for it, but keep in mind to match it with your laptop keyboard. Black colour is best, it completely matches with the laptop."
5,fits perfectly to my keyboard and so so transparent that u can't even see it in the pic I provided..I ordered the transparent one cause of backlit issue in other colours...little bit costly than others but worth the money...go for this one without thinking..🙂

5,"(Full deep review, Everything is covered in this review)Works like a pebble,Feels like a pebble,Glides like a pebble,Priced like a pebble.This pebble shaped mouse is the best for it's price.First you get the mouse itself, battery included, adapter and the instructions how to pair and mode switching.Second it glides on the laminated or smooth surface, user hold your pebble.Third pairing is easy for the first time then to connect to other device by Bluetooth just hold the button, it will blink.For adapter connect to non Bluetooth device, click on the button and light turns green. Easy as a pebble does.AND you can use this mouse for both different system just in a click of a button.BIGGEST THING you can carry on your pocket it is flat as a pebble, so more portable than normal mouse, because it is a pebble.SECOND BIGGEST THING is it doesn't make any noise, even the button and the school wheel makes virtually no sound. What buttons or sorcery they use but definitely for a smooth experience.It is not a red light optical mouse ,It is a infrared led mouse to get that gaming mouse feel when playing games."
5,Have had a MK331 silent mouse for a while. Bought this for work reading about the 100gm unbelievable weight. And the super silent clicks. Not let down one bit. This is a real beauty to hold and use. And best part is the mouse works with either the receiver or Bluetooth built into your pc. Has a toggle below to switch between the two.Overall impressed and highly recommended.
4,Overall it's a really good product but the ergonomics is just not good. I understand the reason for that. It's because it is meant to be a portable mouse and so they have tried to keep a slim profile for this particular product but it doesn't work for me. Some people could say that I should have gone for the MX Master series for a good overall ergonomics but those are way too expensive and so I went for this one instead. I'd like to end this review by mentioning that this is worth every penny spent but the ergonomics is just down right BAD if you look remove price from the equation.
5,Look and feel of this mouse is great. Right and left click is not completely silent but less audible than other mouse. Scroll is smooth and no noise at all. Comfortable to use though the mouse is slimmer and lighter than other traditional mouse. Can be connected to PC or laptop via Bluetooth or supplied 2.4 GHz dongle. Has on/off switch as well as a button to select Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz dongle.
1,"Pros:It looks good.Cons:* Bottom heavy design;  the mouse will slide towards you even with the slightest inclination.* Can only be used on perfectly flat surfaces.* The feet have zero fluidity, cushioning or grip; it feels like I am grating my desk with it!* The Bluetooth connection often resets itself.Awful design and btw, Logitech is extremely overrated. I also bought an wireless keyboard (Logitech K480) for my tablets, the keys are SO SO bad!"
5,"This review is written after two days of use. The mouse unit is smaller than generic mouses and easy to hold. People with bigger hands may find it uncomfortable to hold though. Nm It has both usb dongle and Bluetooth for true wireless experience. There is a button at the back to toggle between usb dongle and Bluetooth mode.While using Bluetooth mode usb dongle is not required. The mouse should be in Bluetooth mode(blue light, blue for Bluetooth) and it needs to be paired from the target device. Once paired it will connect automatically once turned on every time there after. In case we need to use it to a different device to unpair, a long press on the mode toggle button while in Bluetooth mode will do the jobFor usb dongle mode there is practically no hassle. We just need to remove magnetic top cover, get the dongle and plug it into laptop or desktop. Switch the mode to usb dongle mode(green light) and done. Also it remembers the mode. So next time is turned on it will be in usb dongle itself. Once done we can put back the dongle inside the mouse itself so chance of loosing it will be less. Also the dongle is extremely small.I am using it mostly for office work. It is pretty much silent as they claim. However the clicking experience is comparatively smoother than generic mouse. The precision is quite good. Works even on uneven bedsheet. I tried connecting it to Mac, windows 10 and Android Oreo in Bluetooth mode and it worked like charm in every case."
5,Awesome productVery very light and compactConnectivity is super ... connects to my ipad air 3 in just 1 or 2 sec and works greatButtons are also not lose and it looks damn goodGreat buy
5,"The pairing ease and the sleek minimalistic design is a strong pull of this product. Its not exactly the best fit in your hand  (perhaps for most male users with bigger hands) .... but its chic, feels awesome in your hands and is supported by your iPad Pro or any Bluetooth computing device for that matter ... laptops, tablets, fire tv ( although I haven’t used with fire tv much... but it got paired and was functional). Either this or M590 would be great for iPad users ... you need to understand how extensively you want to use a mouse for multi-tasking. iPads support customisable mouse keys and you can make full use of mouse buttons to enhance your productivity. In the end the silent click is super awesome and gives is a premium feel. Go for it ! Especially iPad users."
1,Stone age hardware and computer age price. Logitech you are not Apple to sell the stone at price of gold.
5,"I am writing this after a few hours of usage and below are my observations.1)  Portability: The primary reason for me to buy this mouse. its slim form factor allows you to slide this into your bag, pocket, cocoon organizer, or tech pack, anywhere, its an easy fit.2) Ergonomics: Fairly questionable. This is a trade-off with the form factor. Not suited for gaming or with people large palm.3) Connectivity: Fails to pair with my Lenovo T480 laptop via BlueTooth. Mostly because I did not read the instruction manual properly, I am sure there is a way around this. I do not want to use up the USB ports which is reserved for other devices like VoIP headphones or charging cables. With the receiver connected, it is fairly fast, accurate, and works very well for office tasks.4) For iPads: My second reason to buy this. Pairs fine works decently well. I would hand this to the operating system rather than hardware. The scroll is inverted, there is a fair-but-negligible amount of lag while using it my iPad Mini 5. I wouldn't complain as its primary job is office work, basic designing, or video editing.5) Price: Yes, it's near twice the price but designed to provide the value of 2 mice packed into one. Best suited for people carrying a laptop and iPad."
5,"It’s fantastic product. With Bluetooth I used it for 3D modelling in CatiaV5, very good performance.Easily connected to my IPad Pro as well, superb performance...Highly recommended"
5,"It has been a month since I got this beautiful thing during sale at just under Rs.1350. It comes with an alkaline battery and a usb receiver inside it magnetic flap cover. I haven't come across any cons yet, so I will just list down its pros below.1) Very aptly named as pebble; ergonomically designed and comfortable to hold.2) Super-silent3) Easy to setup and works like a charm4) It can connect to multiple devices both via bluetooth and usb receiver. I have even tried it on android phone.5) Eye-catching and beautiful to look at."
5,"The pebble literally lives up to its name. First of, the magnetic cover is such a brilliant idea. Even though you rarely open the cover up to change the battery or pull out the receiver from the slot, it is a satisfying feel. Coming to Bluetooth pairing, whenever you press the button to pair a device and connected, later if you need to pair to another device, press and hold the button until blue light blinks rapidly. There is no mention about this in the instruction. If this is not done, your device wont show up. Due to my limited knowledge about this, i had to replace the device later to realise the first one was also a functional device.Coming to ergonomics, initially you will find it little difficult to use for long sessions due to its slim profile, however you will get used to it in 2-3 days.Both Bluetooth and wireless connection mode are seamless with Windows 10."
5,"I searched for a affordable and Bluetooth Moise then I discovered this one after a long search and since it had both Bluetooth and usb connection it really mattered to me and I checked the featuresSlimSilentCompactBluetoothUsb connectionGood plasticsGreat battery lifeSturdySwitch modes in a clickLogitech qualityLogitech reliabilityColour optionsSmooth wheelComplete silent operationsHmmm don't know what else to comment I carry my laptop Evey day to my work and in my work able I have a desktop too so I have pared it via Bluetooth to laptop and via USB to desktop so now I got rid of my boring office pc mouse and I can operate both with this single one ,looks awesome and never seen such a long battery life,and it's so silent that I could not believe it and the feel of the click is so great and gentle on one's fingers the wheel scroll is took good toJust buy it and forget it and it's really worth Evey pennyDon't go for cheep stuff and regret , just buy this without a second thoughtHighly recommend:😃"
5,"I usually prefer little bigger mouse that should fit to my palm to avoid pain in palm and fingers. But it is really comfortable fit for all types of palms.Pros: Easy to connect via Bluetooth or USB, No click noise, comfortable fit to palm (big or small palm - added image with small mouse that usually causes me palm pain), connects Bluetooth quickly without manual operation every time, can also connect to mobile thru Bluetooth, Looks awesome.Cons: will not work if you enable ""Airplane Mode"" if it connected thru Bluetooth, Price is little higher but worth, top cap is magnate enabled one hence if fall down it removed easily so careful.Overall - I strongly recommend to go with this if your looking for Bluetooth enabled wireless mouse.Rgs,GCS"
1,Don't go by it's look and feel. The buttons lost sensitivity just after 7-8 months of regular moderate use. Now I have to click several times for one click to work. Always use those Rs 300 wired mouse guys. These overprices cuties are waste of money
1,"I have a smallish hand and loved the shape and size of the mouse. It can connect either with the bundled USB connector or over bluetooth. Bluetooth has no lag as long as the battery is good. But the left click button died in 8 months. Maybe because you need to snap off and remove the entire top (including the buttons) to replace the battery. I expect my mouse to last more than that, given that it's not particularly cheap. Way cheaper mouse are sturdier than this. And the RMA process is designed to mislead and frustrate"
1,"Very hard hard your thumb to hold it for long time as the shape was rounded where you hold your thumb.Clicks are super hard. I think that is the side effect of making it silent..Updated review:Throw it away. Immediately you could notice that your PC is performing super fast. Not exaggeration. Its true. After turning off this mouse I could feel that my PC was back to normal. Very thing including browsing, typing, switching windows was super slow. try disconnecting this stupid mouse your could see the performance. difference. It is not that I dont like Logitech. I own logitech mx master 3, logitech k380 keyboard. They are the best. I got this one because of different size and I wanted to try it."
3,Purchased this M350 Mouse for Rs- 1650 including card offer .This mouse works well with IPAD .But the mouse acceleration unable to control in ipados .so we have to reduce the tracking speed i have attached the screen shot .But with this speed pointer is very slow but no way to control the moue acceleration .But now i am use to it.Increasing the mouse speed increase the mouse acceleration and we won’t be able to click the object  as mouse pointer jumps which is very frustrating .The middle button can be customised in ipados not in mac os .Please be aware this mouse doesn’t support logitech option software both MAC and windows .But it works on both os with out customise option using ogitech option software  .I think the mouse acceleration issue is something apple has to update ipad os .not sure if this is the same case with mx master 2s mouse
5,It has both an infra & bluetooth receiver built in.The bluetooth connectivity is very useful while using with Ultrabooks that generally feature only one USB port that we need for our ext drives.Its low profile design makes it easy to slip in your pocket or slim cases.The battery compartment is accessible from the topside by pulling out the magnetic top.The only unattractive feature is its pricing which is slightly on the higher side.
5,"Greetings everyone.Today I am really pleased to review on Logitech M350 Bluetooth Mouse.Purchase:I purchased this Logitech Bluetooth Mouse online via Amazon website. I had cost me 1850 INR.The box was neat, the carton seemed intact and it was a new product. The date of manufacturing was Nov 2019. I was happy that the mouse was indeed so handy and small.Unbox:When I got the package, the carton was too small when compared to usual mice. I was happy to unbox which was very easy. The mouse had few stickers on glossy finish area and had a small plastic piece covering one of the AA battery. And yeah, you also get a single AA battery pre-installed.The mouse was too sleek, didn’t weigh much (only 109g) and was narrow. The buttons were smooth to press, and the scroll was also nearly soundless. However, the scroll button didn’t act as forward or back option in the mouse. Though it is a nit picking, I found this option more useful than others.Feel:The mouse is great to handle, and it is so sleek that it can fit into your pocket just like a wallet. One can assume it as a thick wallet. The feel and button pressing feels like premium. It is worth the money you spend.Features:The mouse acts as both Bluetooth and Wireless mouse. Yes, this is really an amazing option from Logitech. One can use this mouse as a Bluetooth Mouse if you have less USB ports and as a wireless mouse with the provided USB dongle.All you must do is to press the button at the back of the mouse to toggle from Bluetooth to Wireless. The colour representation is simple, blue for Bluetooth and green for Wireless option.Logitech says that the battery can last up to 18 months with minimum usage.The mouse uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology for better connectivity and power usage.Pros:Compact and sleekUses BLE for better power managementBattery lasts almost after 18 monthsVery low button sounds for quieter environmentsPortable and handyCan be used as both Bluetooth as well as wireless mouseStoring USB dongle is perfect in the mouse with a slotCons:Pricey a bitLosing dongle wouldn’t allow one to use unifying technologyBluetooth connectivity takes a bit more time than other miceMouse seems bit delicateConclusion:This mouse is handy and portable while compared to the conventional ones. It also features both Bluetooth and Wireless 2.4 Ghz technology. The connectivity is simple and easy. And comes with a battery that could last for 18 months. However, at the same time the price is bit more than usual ones and the Bluetooth connectivity takes a bit time. Some PCs which already had previous Bluetooth mice might create an issue with the m350. So, when it comes to sleekness and carrying, this promises to have taken sweet spot."
5,"I was initially apprehensive about buying a flat mouse, without the usual curve. However, after having used for a few days now, stress on my fingers has reduced immensely. Very soft to press, silent. Keep my fingers curved, hand on armrest of chair and press -  no pain in index finger anymore. Switches seamlessly between bluetooth and USB. The battery is supposed to last 18 months and was provided with the mouse. Very satisfied."
5,"Pros :1) Connects instantly2) very handy3) awesome battery life (Have been using it for 4 months, have not changed the battery since then. I use it 12 hours a day - every day.)4) classy5) Connects with mac book  or windows without any issues.6) automatically connects to the laptop as soon as you switch on your laptop.7) Dont need to turn off the mouse, it automatically sleeps if no action is happening.Cons:1) Costly2) scrolling makes noise.3) It so happened, after 3 months of use the mouse stopped responding. At the bottom of the mouse there was a small blue light blinking. As I did not know then what could the blinking light could mean, I assumed the battery might be low.So I changed the battery, which didnt resolve the issue.I reconnected with the bluetooth again, and all was suddenly ok.What I mean to say, after using the mouse for 3 months, this thing has started happening quite often.Meaning, suddenly the bluetooth disconnects.And you will have to manually connect to bluetooth.Up to this point which is 4 months of use, this has happend 3 times, of which all three times has been in last 30 days."
5,"I frequently use my PC and iPad and was looking for a mouse that works for both. Glad I found this one. Since it has Bluetooth, you can use it with mobile devices and it also contains a transmitter for wireless USB. It's extremely quiet and comfortable to use.The resolution is more than enough for everyday use and is good for gaming, but it's perhaps not the best choice for gaming.I've personally tested it with iPad OS, MacOS, Windows and Linux. It works flawlessly on all of them."
5,"This one has both bluetooth and 2.4 ghz connectivity .The best thing about this mouse is it has a slot for the usb connector in the battery compartment so that you need not worry about losing the connector .Click is so inaudible that you need to place the mouse near your ear to hear the click sound.The battery included is of good quality and surely lasts atleast an year.The on off switch functions smooth and it automatically switches off even if you forget to switch it off and leave the switch on.Once you move it or lift it from the surface,it switches on automatically ,so forgiving.It is well worth the price and the hype."
5,"The mouse is extremely easy to connect be it windows or Mac OS. I am using on both and its seamless. The fact that there is no clicking sound makes it even better for an user at home. This is a great tool for WFH. The looks are also very nice and if you pair it with a similar coloured keyboard from Logitech, then the overall look is quite elegant. Functioning and pairing are smooth, definitely recommended. Price is on the higher side but aesthetics make up for the same. PS. Note that the bluetooth dongle needs to be used only if your laptop doesn't have inbuilt bluetooth and bluetooth pairing is very easy."
5,"I purchased this mouse for bluetooth connectivity. And I am impressed with how quickly it connects with the laptop. Almost instantaneous once setup is complete. The keys make no perceptible noise and scroll button is smooth and quiet as well. Looks elegant on the table, saves space and fits well. Not the most ergonomic, especially for longer hours and for bigger hands due to smaller size, probably not for gaming also, but serves the basic functioning flawlessly. Very efficient and simple assembly design.In the box - Mouse with single AA battery already installed (just need to pull on the strip)"
4,"1. I don't know why people complain about ergonomics. This product is not meant for that, it is meant for it's compact size.2. It's heavier than it looks. But I think it's manageable.3. If you have big hands, you might not find it easy to hold. Small and medium size hand folks will find it okay.4. The clicks are silent than usual mouse that we use.Three reasons why I rated it 4 start instead of 5: -1. I had to order a replacement. The first one that got delivered looked like a used product.2. It's a little overpriced. Also, at this price, you should be able to scroll left and right as well using the mid scroll button click.3. It's a little heavier than it should ideally be."
5,"Perfect size for my palm. Can be used for design (like Photoshop) purpose as well. No lag in connecting or mouse pointer movement. Bluetooth connection works great. One small inconvenience is when you use this mouse with Windows and Mac book back to back, every time I need to delete the add the mouse in Bluetooth devices. Only then it works. However this issue is not there if you use only with Windows or Only with Macbook and iPad."
5,"- Dual Connectivity : Mouse has option to connect via inbuilt bluetooth( to any other bluetooth device) or via the usb provided. switching between the connections is simply a button click away on back of mouse.I use this to connect to windows and mac laptops. I use the usb for windows and bluetooth on mac. switching use between laptops is just click of button.- Thin - It is thin and ideal to carry in bags/pocket.- Erogonomic : Coming from the curved mouse design we it feels different initialy, but after some time.- Latest Tech: Uses invisible optic for tracking, silent clicks, compact design."
5,I bought one 6 months back and I was so impressed with the mouse that I bought this one too (This is my second one).Pros:Elegant and beautiful mouse.Usability is outstanding. It is small yet fits right in the palm and the button placements are perfect.It can be connected using Bluetooth and USB.Cons:Can't say anything really!I have read some negative comments and I understand people have their own preferences but this worked perfectly for me.
5,"I initially thought of buying economy make and then after watching few YouTube videos and going through comments I realized when I have spent almost a lac rupees does it makes sense to buy cheap unbranded mouse just to save few hundreds. What I did is right, I got a beautiful piece of gadget which will definitely last longer. It makes no sound ticking, flows like butter , not best but good ergonomic hold, connects in just wink of eye , no lag of cursor while using . U also get a usb Bluetooth adapter if you don't have built in Bluetooth option in your laptop. Overall 💯% satisfied"
3,"This review is not about the specs of this keyboard as there are already plenty of reviews and YT videos for that. Instead I'll focus on who this is ideal for because Logitech has launched it in India at a whopping ₹12995 price tag (~5000 more if converted from US $99 ).This keyboard is worth purchasing if your work/job involves churning out texts – a lot; after all, it has been marketed as a productivity boosting peripheral. Another important point to consider is the fact that this is a low profile chiclet keyboard, so, if you're not into clickity-clackity typing sounds, or rainbow colors and unicorn tails, this is a good choice – especially if you're used to typing on a laptop computer. Also, if you own an Apple magic keyboard and are looking to switch, I think this is a better option. If you're a gamer, you're reading reviews for the wrong product.Cons –Although the keyboard is very sturdy built-wise, my first unit did have some issues, with some keys having a little click friction and sounding different from the rest. I also suspected that the charging on my first unit was not working as advertised because the battery power went down by 25% in just a single day's usage. Thankfully my unit was replaced and the new one seems fine. The problems with previous unit could be due to manufacturing defects but I certainly didn't expect that of a keyboard that cost me almost as much as a mid range phone.All that said, I personally feel it's a good addition to my workspace but based on previously stated points the opinions might differ.-----------------Update:After having used it for a few weeks, the tab key developed the same issue as the previous unit. It still works but it makes that slight ratchety sound when pressed unlike the other keys. Still like the keyboard a lot but that's certainly not expected of Logitech especially in a flagship product. This is clearly a manufacturing defect that might popup in all units sooner or later. That costs this product another star from my end.Set aside above issue alone, rest is really great. The battery life is pretty good, connectivity is instantaneous and the low profile helps me type faster than other keyboards."
3,"Received the keyboard today and it definitely had a luxury feel to it, right from the packing, to it's really cool finish. Definitely deserves the price for the build and precision of the keys and the experience of the key travel. And the great benefit of being able to connect to 3 devices and switching effortlessly between them on the fly is nothing short of brilliance. But why two stars less?Well, this might be subjective, but read on. The keys, I felt were too narrowly packed. Like you have this long keyboard that occupies almost 40% of your desk, but the alphabet keys, especially, are so crammed in. The reason I bought this was to have an ergonomic and relaxed typing experience for work from home, assuming the keys would be spread out. But the experience of typing on this has been no different from typing on a narrow keyboard, sadly. I definitely didn't guess this looking at how long the keyboard  felt in the images. If you leave out the numerical keyboard on the side, along with the page navigation keys, this keyboard is actually quite narrow and gives me shoulder pain. And that defeats the entire purpose of why I got this in the first place. Had the keys been a little more spread out (this would increase the length a little, but I don't think many would mind that, given how minor that would be and yet the great difference it would make for comfort typing).Don't get me wrong. This is an amazing keyboard and many might love it. If all my complaints mean nothing to you, just blindly go for it. It is definitely ideal for people who work a lot on numbers and use the numeric keypad a lot more than I do, and also others who don't really mind not having a relaxed and comfort typing, but a great, precise and well-built keyboard that does its job. Since I was looking for comfortable experience too, for long hours at desk, that didn’t quite go well. But I think I would still keep this keyboard nevertheless, for the other benefits that it offers. This is one of the most bitter-sweet items in my collection."
5,13k is certainly a stretch and so far it's working great out of the box. I used an Apple magic 2 keyboard before this and the typing speed on this is way faster and way more accurate. It's so much heavier than the apple keyboard and does not move. So you don't need to worry about the keyboard moving around.I use this along with an Apple magic trackpad 2 on a mac mini m1 + 16 inch Macbook pro. Great combination.
5,"I got this keyboard on 28th June 2021 and today is 06th Aug 2021, I charged the keyboard completely before using it and it came for 40 days. Yes its true and un believable. The packing was really good and delivered as per the date and in time.I am using this Logitech MX Keys along with Logitech MX3 Mouse and its an deadly combo. I have connected this keyboard with three different laptops. one dongle i am using for my Dell office laptop, the second dongle for my HP personal laptop and thirdly connected to my new latest Apple M1 MacBook Air via Bluetooth.Its as easy as changing the channel in TV remote. Both the keyboard and mouse works flawless with both Windows and Mac OS.Backlit keyboard with sensor is awesome feature which not only saves your battery but also gives you and option of switching the lights on when ever require.You can also customize your keyboard using Logitech software and has excellent features.The look is awesome and there is a deep curve in every key which fills in your finger tip and grips for the accurate typing. The keyboard automatically adjust to Windows and Mac OS.Over all i an very happy and i give 5 star rating.MX3 Mouse is also the best companion to the MA Keys. Both combined works flawless with MAC OS as well as Windows. Similar to MX Keys MX3 Mouse also connects with 3 different devices with out any issue. One of the wonders of modern technology.Combines together you can also loop between devices connected under same network. The key board follows the direction of the mouse and automatically identifies the current system in which the pointer is there and you can use the keyboard in that device.5 Star rating and best product i have ever bought from Logitech."
5,"This is arguably the best wireless keyboard available in the market today. The build quality is brilliant, materials used are clearly premium, the keys have a wonderful tactile play, and I love the automatic key illumination when you move your hands near the keyboard. There is also no lag via the Bluetooth dongle provided.I primarily use this for office work, and spend over 8-10 hours a day - find the ergonomics quite pleasant. It’s definitely not meant for gaming but I doubt any true gamer out there would use a wireless keyboard anyways.No doubt this is pricey for what it offers, but honestly there’s nothing in the market that comes close, so Logitech can afford to charge what they do! Value for money is relative to different people - for me, I feel it’s good value for money."
4,"This is my opinion your experience may differ. First impression the keyboard is beautiful, low profile and the typing experience has been great. Initially I started using a mechanical gaming keyboard, yes I fell for the hype, and  after few weeks of use started regretting it because after so long working in the IT industry being used to  chiclet style laptop keyboard mechanical keyboard feels uncomfortable due to the key travel and hard key press. So, mechanical keyboard IMO good for gaming , because it can bear the brunt of heavy banging, but absolutely no for coding or similar work where in you need to type a lot.The  cons I feel in this keyboard is the backlit. It turns on when your hands approach the keyboard and turns off immediately as you move away. There should be a certain threshold and the backlit should go off only after that. And, yeah it costs more in India than in US and Logitech's customer care is worst , for that matter most of the Customer care of leading brands especially in Computer hardware is SHIT in India. So, if any thing goes wrong GOOD LUCK finding replacement or repair."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard and feels very comfortable to use. It has no sound while typing unless you want to make any sound. Also, it is very easy to get used to itI work for around 12-13hrs a day and I have to charge this may be once in roughly 2 weeks. If you are using a MX Master Mouse it looks beautiful together. The software support is also extended for multiple device usage, along with mouse.Only downside is the cost. If you can afford the cost there is no other downside."
5,"I brought this keyboard after a lot of research. Top notch quality, comfortable all day typing and easy connectivity. I use the logitrch connector to connect it to main workstation and Bluetooth to connect it to the ipad and my personal macbook. I have been using it for 2 months now and I have been highly satisfied. The one issue I seemnto have is the backlighting goes on automatically even of there is no motion from my end. Its not a problem, but sometimes it can drain battery fast. I am yet to figure out what is truggering the backlight."
4,"Overall i like the features of this product. that it gives u seamless connectivity with 3 devices. & its just press of a button away.I am already using MX Master 3 which is more ergonomic and value for money.Here are some of the pros and cons i have observed.Pros:1. Seamless connectivity with 3 Devices2. Logi Flow feature if u r using mx master along3. keys are well spaced so that u lower down typo chances4. Durable & Heavy5. Backlit6. USB C chargingCons:1. Price. Definitely expensive though I got it for Rs. 105002. Requires high actuation force. Which definitely hurt ur fingers, & you will feel your fingers hurt and pain in joints"
5,"Going great so far. The buttons are little mushy while pressing few of the keys but you will get used to it. It improves accuracy. The build is solid and does have a really long battery backup (without the backlit on all the time). Overall at this price point the only competition is the apple keyboard but logitech beats it at both functionality, build quality and number of keys. The one buying this keyboard, would benefit more if they have a mx series mouse as well, as it gives the option to switch between 2 devices flawlessly, but you have to put in some effort while setting the flow option for thr first time. This keyboard can be used for both windows and mac but probably people who are buying it are gonna be mac users. Overall it is a great keyboard. The only things i would want it to have as an improvement is that it should get a higher angle adjustment option, as it sits flat on the table and a palm rest as complimentary in the box."
5,I gave lots of thoughts before buying this keyboard.My Criteria were:- Multiple device switching- Working at night- Mac and windows compatibilityI need to say the mx keys satisfies all the above criteria. Adding to this the finishing is premium it goes well with Mac book pro. You will love the typing feel specially if you have been using the Mac book for a while.Con:Higher priced. But less than the Mac keyboard.
5,"If you say ""Buy this keyboard"" to a non tech-enthusiast or to a person who uses the keyboard normally in day-to-day life they would definitely say that it is a wastage of money but seriously it is not. This is definitely the best wireless - backlit keyboard. The looks are very stylish and it saves a lot of space on my desk. I am a software engineer but generally use the keyboard for 8-10 hours a day so it's definitely worth every penny for me."
5,"Value for money ? Hell no. But face it, if u are planning to buy this keyboard, then probably that is out of the picture. The keyboard is well built, and really helps with work for a coder. I thought I was a fan of mechanical keyboards but just realised they are not for me. Wish they were priced at 100USD here as well, or a premium of 2k would be nicer, but 5k is a bit steep. This paired with MX3 is a breeze. And I have a macbook pro with which the flow works amazing. All you have to do is move the cursor to the next screen and both keyboard and mouse are now connected to the next device. Happy to pay for the features though."
1,"MX keys - Key stokes are short (Use and get to know, Please visit a Logitech shop for trial and then buy its not to everyone taste, poor ergonomics, no hand rest) with little to no resistance; 13K wasted on high quality plastic."
5,It gives you a joy while typing on this keyboard. Aesthetically pleasing ergonomics.The product pictures do not match with the actual keyboard layout though it did not make a difference to me at all.Amazon should have delivered the product in a corrugated box rather than just a default box.The pricing is almost a twice of of US pricing ; that would be a thing to keep in mind.
5,Very happy with the keyboard. I was using wired Apple keyboard (metal white keys full numeric keypad model). This feels more premium and very nice to type on. The contours on the keys makes it all happen.
5,"If you want to switch between 3 systems, this is the only option available. This is an excellent keyboard if you are ok with low-key travel. Very High-quality switches, and a backlit effect is good, lights come up only when your hands reach keyboard. Buy for easy switching between systems and low profile high quality keys."
5,"Keyboard design is great. It's ergonomic, heavy enough to keep Keyboard stable. No wires, charges quickly. Type C  to type A connectivity for charging. Backlit brightness can be adjusted. Retains battery/charge for more than 20 days for me. I leave it on all the time. I think keyboard is way to costly comparing these with keychron, etc."
5,"The best. Sleek, low profile, classy and everything you've ever wanted a minimalist keyboard to be. It's a hefty cost, but worth every penny and more. I'm surprised they don't even have anything close out there. It's no wonder pretty much every WFH setup video features this except for the gamer dudes. They would prefer the a Keychron or similar.  MX Keys with the MX Master 3 is just bliss."
4,I am a software professional and my job requires me to type a lot everyday. I got this keyboard after searching for a lot of mechanical keyboards and finally saw this one on the Logitech website.The keyboard is very good for anyone who is typing fast. In fact I have improved my typing speed with this keyboard. And the typing experience just feels comfortable. The illumination from the keyboard is decent at night. We have the sensor which lights up when the fingers are just a few inches above the keyboard which is a nice feature.Another reason I had considered this keyboard was its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices. I have 2 laptops one with Windows 10 and another with MacOS. This keyboard easily switches between the laptops on the press of a button and that's a big time saver. We don't have to manually pair the keyboard with each laptop when we are using it.
4,only thing about this is its very priceyThough there are other products by logitech itself which does most the functions do like the build quality and smoothness .Type C charging is added  great way for charging.
5,"Buying this keyboard was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The setup of this keyboard was super easy and as soon as I started typing I could feel the difference. If you need to type throughout the day, especially for your job, I recommend that you splurge on this keyboard."
2,"The ""ctrl"" key is not working properly, some times it pull up, not happy with product.. not worth 13k with this product.."
5,"Amazing keyboard.  It’s much better than apple magic keyboard in every aspect.Easy to connect and use with 3 devices.I’m using it with Mac, windows laptop and iPhone.Switch between device by just one keypress is awesome idea.Look n feel beautiful."
3,I like the built. May be best low profile keyboard in market but not for me.I started feeling pain on my fingers tip.
5,"I use it in 2 different devices and seamlessly I move from one to other. Excellent for high and low light, including darkness. Very nice when you touch the keys. Very firm stand.I think it is the best keyboard I ever purchased."
1,Feel is not premium as the cost tag it has. Multiple OS compatibility not efficient. Some keys won't work after switching to different OS even after enabling to particular OS with keys suggested(fn P/O).
4,"Liked the layout ,the keys feel good and the backlit functionality is very helpful, but the only set back is functions like short cuts for delete , don't function with the Mac. May be a software update will rectify it."
5,"This is a beautiful keyboard. If you’re looking for a keyboard that will connect to 3 devices and can switch effortlessly between them. Then look no further. This one’s perfect. The backlight’s great, the typing is so good although it’s not mechanical."
5,Yes it’s little bit expensiveBut it deserve the priceBest keyboard I ever useIt’s silent it’s good look
4,Only refresh rate lacks but overall a decent monitor. It would be wise of not compared woth high end monitors or your laptop. 'Itne mein itna hi milega' kind of monitor😀
5,Superb built and quality. Using it as my office desk screen. Works perfect for me
5,"- large 24"" display- no light bleed issue, no dead pixels- slim and light weight- IPS display with good viewing angle- I bought at 11,500 during sale. Gave the best specs at this price point"
4,Material used is overall of little bit cheap quality i face some manufacturing defect in side strip of panel of panel is not properly locked Overall quality good but not satisfied with the build quality
5,"Great product from Lenovo , highly recommended"
5,It's very high resultion of with HDMI it's very classy performance
5,It is a good monitor. Only con is not without any speakers. Otherwise picture is good no bleeding issues.
4,It is good monitor at this price range. Due to thin bezels around we can use it in multiple monitor setup.  The only negetive is its height cannot be adjusted.
1,"So many dead pixels, quality check is a joke for lenovo!! Better buy acer monitors!!"
5,good product
4,Slim and light weight and very nice monitor for work from home
5,Perfect for my gaming Amd processor PC.
5,Good display. Bright ND clear..
5,So far so good.
4,Good
5,Good product. Worth it
3,Not up to the mark
4,"The monitor was delivered on time and with good packaging.I ordered this monitor for work from home. I use this monitor for work all day. The monitor is thin and sleek. I did not find any glare, assembly was easy. It took sometime to figure out that there was no inbuilt speaker. It came with HDMI cable and was easy to connect to laptop.The monitor screen quality is just right for me so far.The only thing i wonder is that the screen is only 21 inches and 54 cm as given in technical spec of this product, so why does it say 23.8 inches, im not sure. I find 54cm is just right for me as well.I like the picture quality and the brightness and the overall ergonomy of the monitor. The height is not adjustable, most monitors do not come with adjustable height either.Overall Im happy with the ease of assembly, use and quality of the monitor."
5,Good one. Has tilt adjustment. Comes with HDMI cable. But no height adjustment. I prefer to spend another 2000 more and buy the next model with height adjustment
5,I am using this monitor for 2 years now no problem till now with nvidia graphic card you can get 75hz refresh rate with 1920x1080 resolution the bezel less experience is goodThe colour accuracy is perfectIf you are a person with 3D and artistic skill with good knowledgeYou can get this
5,"Really good product by Lenovo, picture quality and brightness are good. Apart from that lookwise is as per the expectations."
2,I am using Dell monitor which is 8 years old and recent one HP monitor which is 2 months old.  When compared to these 2 the lenovo monitor doesn't meet the expectation.  There's no sharpness on the monitor. Tried with all the setting but it seem to be very bright or contrast and not able to get the right sharpness.  The plastic quality of the monitor is too thin to handle.  The logo in front is out of proportion to the monitor size.Overall not satisifed for the price paid.
5,"I wanted a bazel less, fullhd monitor  which has comfortable viewing angles , Found this for cheap(rs.6200) but the quality of this product looks premium. Fully satisfied with this monitor. The Image quality is very good. I was expecting a HDMI Cable with it, But it was not there."
4,"Purchased this monitor for around 6k. I use it for media consumption and web surfing, and performance has been good in these areas. Colours are well reproduced, and the monitor itself is easy to assemble. The narrow bezels (except for the bottom) means it's nice to look at too. Contrast and brightness are somewhat lacking compared to more expensive monitors, but the price tag justifies this. There's no HDR support either. You will need a HDMI cable, since only a VGA cable is included in the box.This is a monitor for someone with few requirements and fewer rupees in their account. Gamers, media editors and enthusiasts may want to look elsewhere."
1,I’m writing this review after a use of 6 monthsThe display is okay for the price and works fine. Quality of display is also good for the priceBut in 4 months time i started getting shocks on my laptop connected to the display. On further inspection the electrician found the culprit was this display.They have 3 years warranty but the service only happens if you get the display to their service center or mail it to them. And its a pain in the a$$ to deal with their service Center executives.A good product otherwise might be the piece i got was faulty. But a salty experience nonetheless.
4,"Got it today. I was a little disappointed with the packing. It was very ordinary, the seal was also broken. But thank God, nothing happened to the monitor. I am quite impressed with the physical structure of the monitor, just that the stand looks quite outdated. But its fine, after all, it's the display and the colour reproduction that mattered the most. This monitor has a great display, the viewing angle from the side is also good... As of now, at this very moment, I'm pretty much happy with this monitor.."
1,Please do not buy this monitor as it looks amazing on website but not at all good. Its picture quality is very dull and shows fade yellowish colour instead of white colour.....Instead anyone can buy LG's Monitor. Little price variation but far better than this monitor...
5,"Ita the best WFM monitor in 2021 2nd half price.all monitor cost has gone up..i already own Dell P2419Hthis has comparable pic quality and higher refresh rate , but miss out on heigt adjustment, input options and usb uplink."
5,"I bought this monitor at a price of ₹7499 but when it was delivered to me on that day amazon reduced the price to ₹6990 thats very unfair and makes me feel cheated.Product Review:The packaging was okay. Amazon doesn’t put extra packaging on top of product. Simply put shipping label on top of the brand packaging and ship it. Product is working super good, picture quality is super good and audio output is also good. HDMI makes everything soo better."
5,"Loved the monitors, i ordered 2 of those Lenovo 21.5 inch L22e-20 Monitors and it works as expected. Can do normal office work with ease and if you're a gamer or watch 4k movies a lot then this product is not for you. Smooth transition b/w multiple screens/displays. Supports AMD-free sync if you're having an AMD chip in you laptop/pc.Overall its a good monitor."
2,"The viewing angles are not what it says in specs, the image looks distorted as even if you by 5 degrees from center of screen. There is something wrong with the contrast the image looks too white. Even after trying different settings and different machines mac/windows."
5,"I have given 5 stars because it is the best (in this range of price) Monitor for my use case. Here are my personal thoughts.Here's why you should buy it:- You are planning to use it for Gaming- You are planning to use it for watching Videos/Movies or other Multimedia- You are planning to use it for Programming/Development- You plan to do basic editing where the colour doesn't need to be too accurateHere's why you shouldn't buy it:- You already have a monitor that has higher colour accuracy than this one (which is 72% NTSC) because if you do, you're probably not going to like it- You need higher colour accuracy- You're going to be doing pretty much colour accurate work like Video (advance stuff like color grading, color correction, etc)Also, things you must make sure you know before buying it:- This is a VA Panel and not IPS. Please research on Internet the difference between the two- The blacks on this Panel are pretty dope but the viewing angles are not as good as IPS ones- HDMI Cable isn't provided in the box, you'll need to buy or have it with you before hand (unless you plan to use VGA)Final thoughts, the monitor is pretty damn good. Id definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for similar price and use case. I've always been a fan of Lenovo and honestly, I haven't been disappointed by any of the Lenovo products I've ever had. I was scared of the packaging though, it was looking like it had been opened but it wasn't, I was just too skeptic. But make sure you do check your package."
1,"After few months of use it's HDMI port stop working and then display get distorted and becomes totally un usable after few more days. the worst part is service which is just for the name sake of 3 years. actually it couldn't provide the service in very first year of purchase. they rejected the issue in very tricky way, below is lenovo service reply, afterwards they didn't clarify this mail even asking for -Dear Customer,Greetings and thank you for contacting Lenovo technical support.We understand that the system has an issue with Dead pixels issue.As per the snapshot video received, we are sorry to inform you that this system is beyond the scope of support of ‘Accidental Damage Protection’ .We could surely have assisted if the system had ‘Accidental Damage Protection’.We request you to contact the nearest Lenovo authorized service center for a chargeable repair .Regards,Lenovo Technical Support"
5,"Reviewing after 2 days of purchase:Received the monitor in good condition. Original product packaging was good enough. Amazon only provided one layer of additional package and it was enough.In the box, only VGA cable is present. If you want HDMI cable, then you should buy it separately.Build quality is good for this price. Except, that the stand is too thin for the monitor size and it leads to shaking of the monitor even on slight disturbance.Display is enough for doing office work and watching videos. I didn't test more than that.Both VGA and HDMI connections works well.Overall for this price (6999 INR when I bought) it looks totally worth it."
3,I really dont understand.. There is VGA cable with the product but not HDMI. Laptops also dont provide VGA ports nowadays. 500 rupees lesser than other brand monitors because of this. Better you buy other monitors... Dont have to go through the hassels of fetching hdmi cable.
5,"Amazing product from lenovo , edge to edge display with a beautiful and minimalist design , amazing connectivity including HDMI and audio jack ! Picture quality is amazing ! And it's crisp with good contrast . Brightness is enough for a will lit room . When run on 60hz , no tearing or lag was seen , completely seamless experience. Installation wise it was plug and play ! Overall a perfect product ! Must buy !."
4,"Product arrived in brand new condition with average packaging, within the stipulated delivery date. Monitor works perfectly for watching movies, gaming or office work. You can use it  for gaming and other purposes without using the in-built feature of AMD FreeSync. I am not using FreeSync and face no issues of lag or glitch because of it. Value for money !"
5,I'm very much impressed with the quality of the monitor outputGo for it if you are looking one within the 7-8k rangeLooks very sleek and light weight
5,"Though I haven't tried gaming on the display, it's an excellent product for 1080p video/movie so far. I have connected this display to my old laptop now I don't want to do any thing on my laptop. Build quality could be better. Easy to install. HDMI cable and power cable are long enough for proper desktop management. So far no regrets."
4,"The product is best of best, with small to no edge corner make look great as well the viewing experience.GAMING:If you're a true gamer you might not like this monitor because the refresh is visible as it moves frame which is kind of totally odd while playing.ENTERTAINMENT:Perfect without a doubt go for it. You won't feel the refresh issue here.CODING/PROFESSIONAL:I bought it for this purpose only so here's the deal if you don't care about watching frame moving to another frame that feels like as a developer so goes for it."
4,It's a good screen with vibrant colours along with a great design. Looks unique compared to other monitors.Only issue is that the stand is not height adjustable hence you need to take this into consideration.
4,"Picture quality is very good other than the annoying dead pixel (there's just one but now that I've seen it, can't un-see it).The overall build quality and image quality is very good.Haven't tried a lot of gaming on this but it should be decent, don't expect frame-perfect performance.Definitely a worthy recommendation if you can get it in some offer."
5,"this monitor can be connected to a PS4 and also to the computer , the display and the performance is very good, no lag when playing ps4 games and overall I really love the monitor. If any one are looking for multipurpose monitor then this is for you."
5,This is very good products.. and Quality is very good also... The Picture Quality is amazing.. perfect for gaming.. and movies also because brightness is good.. Price is very good..
1,"I had just received the product. It had dead pixels, dust on-screen and scratch marks on the monitor stand. I immediately called Amazon customer service. They responded positively. Excellent customer service! Promised replacement within 5 days. Hope I get the replacement soon. Will update on the replacement after I get it."
5,"Things i like- sharpness, good colours, borderless from sides. I play on ps4, its comfortable for eyes as well as you can carry long gaming sessions.Things i dont like - no hdmi cord included. I am still not able to figure out picture settings. The screen has refresh rate of 60hz so good for only consoles and low end pcs"
5,"Absolutely loved the product. It has many viewing options that inspite of the light from the front, you will still be able to read the content on the acreen clearly.Worth it. Don't think.... Just go for it in this price segment."
3,Picture Quality is average not HD. Misinformation provided by seller that it includes HDMI cable. Only VGA cable is included. Amazon Firestick is not detected so thats another misinformation.
4,"It's been 3 Days and I really liked the Picture Quality. What disappointed me was, there is no HDMI cable that came along. However, there is VGA Cable, but my office laptop doesn't have VGA port. I have to buy HDMI cable separately.I am using it with my personal laptop and I am really happy with it."
1,"Low brightness, some shade producing. Low picture quality.We can't conveniencing the customer support team to replace the monitor"
4,Only refresh rate lacks but overall a decent monitor. It would be wise of not compared woth high end monitors or your laptop. 'Itne mein itna hi milega' kind of monitor😀
5,Superb built and quality. Using it as my office desk screen. Works perfect for me
5,"- large 24"" display- no light bleed issue, no dead pixels- slim and light weight- IPS display with good viewing angle- I bought at 11,500 during sale. Gave the best specs at this price point"
4,Material used is overall of little bit cheap quality i face some manufacturing defect in side strip of panel of panel is not properly locked Overall quality good but not satisfied with the build quality
5,"Great product from Lenovo , highly recommended"
5,It's very high resultion of with HDMI it's very classy performance
5,It is a good monitor. Only con is not without any speakers. Otherwise picture is good no bleeding issues.
4,It is good monitor at this price range. Due to thin bezels around we can use it in multiple monitor setup.  The only negetive is its height cannot be adjusted.
1,"So many dead pixels, quality check is a joke for lenovo!! Better buy acer monitors!!"
5,good product
4,Slim and light weight and very nice monitor for work from home
5,Perfect for my gaming Amd processor PC.
5,Good display. Bright ND clear..
5,So far so good.
4,Good
5,Good product. Worth it
3,Not up to the mark
4,"The monitor was delivered on time and with good packaging.I ordered this monitor for work from home. I use this monitor for work all day. The monitor is thin and sleek. I did not find any glare, assembly was easy. It took sometime to figure out that there was no inbuilt speaker. It came with HDMI cable and was easy to connect to laptop.The monitor screen quality is just right for me so far.The only thing i wonder is that the screen is only 21 inches and 54 cm as given in technical spec of this product, so why does it say 23.8 inches, im not sure. I find 54cm is just right for me as well.I like the picture quality and the brightness and the overall ergonomy of the monitor. The height is not adjustable, most monitors do not come with adjustable height either.Overall Im happy with the ease of assembly, use and quality of the monitor."
5,Good one. Has tilt adjustment. Comes with HDMI cable. But no height adjustment. I prefer to spend another 2000 more and buy the next model with height adjustment
5,I am using this monitor for 2 years now no problem till now with nvidia graphic card you can get 75hz refresh rate with 1920x1080 resolution the bezel less experience is goodThe colour accuracy is perfectIf you are a person with 3D and artistic skill with good knowledgeYou can get this
5,"Really good product by Lenovo, picture quality and brightness are good. Apart from that lookwise is as per the expectations."
1,The 'Top of Line' product works as a monitor just fine. But the built in Camera and Mic cannot connect to a MAC Operating SystemIf you are a MAC user beware of this product
4,"This is a pretty decent height adjustable monitor from Acer. The camera is on par with a budget laptop camera (a Logitech 720p webcam is more bright and less grainy) and is just serviceable. It supports windows hello login (if you are using it for work, it must be allowed by your IT which is quite a hurdle). The speaker is also OK occasional use, but for entertainment it probably will be inadequate (this is a business monitor after all).The bundled power cable is 16Amps. Don't understand the reason (the monitor does have a fast charging USB) but it certainly isn't something you would expect (forget connecting this to UPS as most doesn't support a 16A plug). I think it might have been a mistake/oversight from Acer to package this with a 16A plug.The webcam is what is shown in picture (the round one that can be tilted).If your PC or dock has a DPI out, then the monitor has a DPI In. VGA, Audio Out, Headphone, and 3 USB slots (one is fast charging) are the additional ones."
1,"I purchased this product to establish a Home office desk, narrowed down to this one after several reviews from the Internet. Alas it was too good to be true.Pros:- The 27"" screen size is a fairly big real estate in terms of screen size.- The design of stand helps in flexible movement of the screen vertically as well as horizontally.Cons:-The product was delivered by Amazon right on time, however unboxing I realised that it had a prominent backlight bleeding. Amazon promptly replaced the product within a couple of days, unfortunately even the new replacement had some bleeding, but the worst part was, the product was giving electric shocks( mind you I am stating this after testing my electric connection and finding it ok).- The VGA Camera is really a downer, it is bad - I mean grainy quality bad. Would recommendone to invest in a seperate camera rather than using this integrated camera.- Sound quality is not great, but manageable.Thankfully, with help of Amazon, I was able to return the monitor within the timelimit and secure a refund."
1,"Display Port not working, Audio not working, Webcam drivers not getting installed. When contacted the Acer support, support person who came to fix it said, it will work only in Windows10 and closed the case. Im helpless"
5,"One of the best affordable monitors along with webcam and mic. Comparing to HP, this has got the best price. However, the speakers of the monitor does not support any bass. But its very good in performance and very useful for daily office calls. Go for this if you do daily MS Teams / Skype office calls."
5,"I am using this monitor as a daily driver for my office. Its little bright for my eyes(my taste) when a white screen appears. The camera quality good(should not be compared to that of phone), mic is also good(i haven't tested noise cancelling, but there are two mics), speakers are also good.I use the supplied hdmi cable to connect it to my laptop, and i am happy with the product."
4,"It’s a nice product for office use. The height adjustment, IR sensor, camera, and microphone works well. The only thing that can be improved is the speakers. My tiny laptop is louder than this big screen! Giving star less only for that, otherwise it’s a 5 star product."
3,"Works generally very well, excellent look and feel, good featuresBUTwhen on Zoom attached to my laptop, after some time the screen goes dark and no imagethen comes back on, goes off again, have checked connections etc, all fine... and apart from thisworks fine. but disappointed as zoom use was one primary reason to buy"
3,"I may have too excited about buying this monitor, the moment I saw the Specification. Wanted a 27inch Monitor with WebCam at a reasonable price. While this monitor meets most of the requirements, it works well for Windows Machines. I have a Mac, so the WebCam is useless - No drivers for Mac. It would have been useful for me buy a standalone monitor and a standalone WebCam. It would have been slightly cheaper with better specifications."
5,"Good monitor for the priceA couple of things:I connected it to my new Mac mini with M1 chipFor the webcam to work, need to connect the usb cable to the Mac mini in order to power it up.The colours are ok, slight blurring of picture. Resolution could be betterHaven’t yet found a way to work the inbuilt USB ports on the monitor with my Mac mini!"
5,Better but not working in windows 7
1,Don’t know how to make the camera work. Spent a lot of time . No proper support or guidance from Acer. Also not sure whether there is a mic. Speaker volume is low. Except for the big screen nothing appeals
1,"Unable to install webcam driver, trying from 3 to 4 days. I am using windows 7 OS. Please help..."
3,The power cable for the monitor had a 3 pin plug of 16A rating instead of the standard 6A rating. For such devices. The product description does not mention the requirement of 16Aplug.
5,"Very Good, really happy with inbuilt Camera and Sound Quality"
5,"Good monitor. As I wanted. Good screensize, display and functionalities. Good value for money."
5,Excellent product and amazon delivery service is very fast. Thanks amazon
3,"Monitor cable is not compatible in India, acer should recheck cables before shipping. Video camera is ok, sound is ok,"
3,Very poor audio quality. Otherwise it is good
2,Setting up is easy. Cera function not being recognised by the PC. Sound is not working!
4,Speakers are not better(2w+2w)Can adjust by connecting with a bluetooth or external speaker if required.
2,"Didn't work for me properly, display was poor. Looked like a refurbished product.."
1,Camera not upto the mark
4,It's a good monitor.. gentle on the eyes. Camera does the job well
4,Good quality product
5,Wonderful. Very good product with inbuilt webcam and micro phone
4,Value for money product but delivery is very bad form amazon.
1,19 inch monitor inside the box/not 21.5 inch monitor
5,If you purchase a mini cpu then it is nothing less than AIO
4,This is good 👍. But this has a 🤢 poor Sound quality
1,"It has backlight bleeding issue and 2 corners turned gray within 3 days, got the replacement but problems remain same in new product also. Unfortunately there is no refund option available for this product and had to settle down with same product."
1,"Right off the bat, the backlight bleeding issue is horrible, no true contrast ratio so the picture is always washed out, will tinker with the settings to see what can be done."
4,"If the only thing you will do with this monitor is watch videos or play games, then this gives you the best bang for your buck! Go ahead and buy it with your eyes closed.But if you try to read any text below font size 18, the screen struggles terribly, and you start realising why this is the cheapest curved monitor available.The colour bleed is pathetic. Bright colours on black background bleeds quite far to the right.But then, I'm sure you wouldn't buy a 27"" curved monitor to stare at word documents or read emails all day. The bleed somehow just vanishes when running a video or a game. Can't really complain that much, at this price."
3,"This monitor isn't really for everyone. It's a good monitor, I really liked some aspects of it, but the cons of this monitor overwhelm the pros of the monitor, not by much though. If you can live through the cons, this monitor just might be for you. Gonna start with the cons:1. Backlight Bleeding - If you don't know what this means, the LCD(liquid crystal display), the screen, is Backlit by CCFL/LED's, the LCD blocks out the backlight that is not needed when displaying a particular image. When this light is not 100% blocked, allowing excess light to ""bleed"" around the edges of the LCD panel.This issue makes the background light up at some spots at the edges on a dark/black background. This is really annoying. It did bother me. This type of issue happens when the monitors are not 'factory calibrated'.2. Viewing Angles - Monitor is advertised for 178degrees, which is not entirely true. You can see as wide as 178degrees. But colours especially blacks and whites turn into greyish black and yellowish white, image(desktop wallpaper) quality really gets worse after about 40 degrees from centre, also the light spots due to backlight bleed really starts to show up at when you watch screen from the angle, However shockingly when watching movies, the viewing angles are much better, still can't be compared with an IPS panel viewing angles, which are way better than these. (This monitor has a VA panel)Now for the pros, and why should you get it?1. Deep Blacks - Oh my god, I loved the blacks of this screen, but only when viewing from the centre. This monitor has deep rich blacks than any IPS panel screen I have worked on. Blacks tend to get screwed up when viewing from the angle due to backlight bleed.2. Curved screen - At this price point, this is the only curved screen in the market. Curved screen doesn't really matter for 24"" 16:9 monitor. It's not wide enough to really feel that immersive experience. Although aesthetically it does look pleasing, your family members or friends will get intrigued by seeing a curved screen. As a user, it didn't really matter to me. This one is subjective user to user.My verdict, if you can live through backlight bleeding and weird colour reproducing when viewing through angles. This monitor produces really deep contrast images with vivid colours when viewing from the centre and it just might for you.Professionals - I won't recommend for professionals or for office use. However, It will work for professional use if you work alone and doesn't really care about viewing angles. Still better if you go with an IPS panel monitor.Hardcore gamers - I won't recommend for hardcore gaming too, No gaming monitor is made of VA panel. Do you wanna win a game or have a better contrast?Casuals - Recommended for this category, this category is for people who wanna use for browsing, do some gaming but are not a hardcore gamer. Someone who watches a lot of movies. This might be the right one for you and a steal deal for the price you are getting compared to the rest of the market.I returned the monitor because of the annoying backlight bleed issue."
1,"THESE ARE GOOD BUDGET MONITORS FOR CAUSAL USE, BUT DON'T BUY THEM FOR GRAPHIC DESIGN / DUAL, TRIPLE MONITOR SETUP.These monitors are not factory calibrated for colors. I have bought 3 monitors and all the three monitors show different colors. One of the monitor has a red tinge and the other one has a blue tinge. All 3 monitors have different brightness levels with one monitor being very bright. This makes it very difficult to use in a dual or a triple monitor setup because each monitor shows colors differently. I have done factory reset on all of the 3 monitors prior to use and they all have different colors out of the box. I have spend hours trying to adjust the RGB values individually and I cannot get all the 3 monitors to match the colors. Additionally there is a severe problem with clouding which can be clearly noticed.No wonder why these monitors are cheap and there is a 1 per customer limit. These are C grade factory reject panels which made their way into these budget monitors."
5,"just a superb display.i saw people complaining about light bleed etc issues but plz note that all those reviews Complaining have taken picture from side and not from front....as it a va panel and not IPS display one can not expect same viewing experience from all angles as it is a curved monitor and meant to be seen from center and from there its just superb n flawlesss.... expecting a monitor to behave like tv is foolishness....about the curve, its a delight.... working on curve become Very Much interesting as it gives a theatre like feel....most of th negetive reviews r misleading .... there can be manufacturing defects but thts a saparate issue and for that there is a smooth return replacement policy so worries end hereitself...blindly go for it  ..  a curved monitor at this price during deals n sales is a dream..cheers"
3,Updated review : new 2019 stock all have yellow white point.. If you watch a white photo.. It s looking yellow.. When I contacted samsung they say it is fine...yellow is white for them... Don't even think of buying this monitor... They are cheating Indian customer by selling defective items... 2019 stock all have yellow tinge.. Cannot be fixed.. Even my replacement had it.. So had to return it again.... I never expected samsung brand to cheat Indian customer like this.. Shame on you samsung..Old review :If you siiting exactly in middle then it s fine.. If you are seeing from side then it sucks.. Edges are darker than middle.. Picture quality s good..viewing angle sucks.. Power button is in back side and not easy to use.. Max frame rate 60 hz.. 3 years warranty
4,"Sharp display and vibrant color reproduction. Use it for photo editing, and the output is true to real (got similar print out as you see on monitor from Vistaprint). Not using it for gaming so cannot comment on how fast the monitor is.It has a HDMI (supports 1080p) and a VGA connection and also a 3.5 audio jack in case you want to plug in your headphone/speaker for HDMI audio.A caution for those moving from flat screen to a curved screen for first time, it takes a little time to adjust for your eye to see from a curved surface."
5,"I have two of these monitors. The first one was bought in late 2017 and I bought another one now. I work with a lot of Word, Text and PDF documents and it is easier if I can keep multiple screens open. All these days I was using the laptop screen + the external monitor as a dual screen set-up. But the laptop screen is quite small (13"" Toshiba Z30C), so I decided to invest in a second monitor.  This review is for regular users (not gamers.)[1] The main feature I love is the 'eye saver mode'. Considering that I use the monitors for 10 ~ 12 hours every day, I can feel the difference. When I use it in normal mode, I get eye strain. The reddish eye saver mode is quite effective.[2] When connected with HDMI, the audio signal is also optionally output through the Headphone jack behind the monitor. Since I use my laptop as a CPU and prefer to keep it on a shelf, I can use wired headphones easily through the monitor port - quite useful.[3] I run dual extended monitors - one connected via HDMI & one with VGA - both run at full HD (1920 x 1080) mode. The VGA connection will be a little fuzzy around the font edges, but given that VGA is analog signal, this is natural. Both are perfectly usable and if they were separate, I wouldn't even notice the fuzziness. But when they are right next to each other, I can make out the difference.[4] The curvature of the monitor does not adversely affect image editing; it works perfectly fine. Straight-lines are still straight lines in any image editing software.[5] Since VGA is becoming quite obsolete, some of the newer monitors have started dropping the VGA port. But it is quite useful, especially if your machine already has dual ports.Only grouse : Compared to the previous edition that I bought in late 2017 (Same Model), there has been a little bit of cost cutting. Last time the box had HDMI + VGA cables. This time, the box only had the VGA cable.My verdict : It is a good monitor and worth buying if you have to work with multiple screens."
3,"Okay let's start off the things you shouldn't get it to do in it: Video rendering, Photo editing, Graphic designing, Programming or any kind of editing related to texts and visuals.The things this is good for: Gaming and watching movies and for your entertainment purposes.Just look at the first image (*sharpness is on 60). The text looks pixelated (your eyes will catch more than my camera did) and it becomes hard to read the small texts. Obviously a 15'' 1080p display would look good but when you pack those pixels in a larger 24'' display, you're gonna get more jagged edges. The pictures look fine but if you're looking at the tiny ones (e.g. a youtube thumbnails), you'll notice how grainy they are.It's hasn't even been 2 month and yet I got a dead (or stuck) pixel and the HDMI port stopped working. Now, I'm stuck with the VGA. I will claim the warranty and get it checked off! Edit: HDMI port wasn't faulty, the cable was. Also, using a premium quality cable drastically improves the picture quality and sharpness!It does have tilt! People who are saying this can't be tilted, must look at the fourth picture. Just apply some force to the upwards and it will tilt!Some users are complaining about the bleeding issue (from the sides) and the bad viewing angles. But they must know before buying this is that it is a VA panel (clearly mentioned in title, isn't it?) and VA panels are all about the center & single-person things. So if you're buying one, then you must know that you are buying it for yourself and not for the person looking at your monitor from the side. But these panels tend to have good color productions (not as IPS though) but it doesn't seem to be with this monitor. With some tweaks I somehow managed some fixes for the yellowish tint and washed out colors:(I have my brightness on 30)- Set the sharpness to 60/63 and the contrast to 75. (If isn't already)- Go to the Color and set the gamma to Mode3, Red to 43, Green to 45 and the Blue to 52. This will produce more vibrant colors and fix the yellowish tint.- *Keep the Samsung Upscale turned off, it certainly drops the image quality and increases sharpness.- Choose the response time as fastest (optional).And adjust the tilt and make it more centered, so the bad viewing angles won't bother you.If you're planning to buy it just to game and watch movies, you can go for it. 27'' model would be better, because you will less notice the curve from the middle in the smaller one. A 24 inch monitor with curve is straight up a gimmick!But if it's not for your entertainment purposes, then I'd recommend you to go with the LG's 22'' IPS monitor (priced same as this one on Amazon). The larger screen and curve must not allure you, a large monitor will only look sharp and good if it's at least 1440p and having an IPS panel."
1,"I have purchased this four months back and now the display is not working , when i call customer care they are telling the pannel is gone and we have to change this,My product is unber warranty, but still they are charging me 8900 for monitor replace ment.Actual monitor cost is 9400 only.This is literally cheating the customers.Actually i want to give Zero rating for this product but i could not"
5,"If you are going to do gaming for joy (not a professional gamer), or you enjoy watching a lot of videos on internet this is a very good budget friendly option.Following are the points I noticed worth mentioning:PROS....1. The curve of the screen is very much noticeable even from a distance which adds the most value for the product.2. The control joystick is a great additional feature which makes changing settings a joy.3. The screen is tiltable so that absence of height adjustment not greatly felt.4. Freesync enabled, screen refresh rate goes up to 72 hz.5. Great viewing angles, no need for screen swiveling (option not provided though).Cons...1. No height adjustment option.2. No HDMI cable bundled in the box, only a VGA (aka D SUB) cable is provided.Finally, thanks Amazon & seller Appario for delivering this within 12 hours of ordering."
5,"I was in the market, looking for a large size monitor (22+ inches) when I came upon this one. This monitor was priced roughly the same as other monitors of the same size despite this being a curved one. Initially I was skeptical of getting the curved one wondering how it would look for my coding/writing purpose. Curved monitors are usually great for watching videos and movies etc bringing more depth and immersion into the experience however the use with text and graphical interfaces was unknown. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised that the monitor performed excellently even for this. Due to the size, you can fit in a lot of windows and sections of the IDE and you can read more lines of code at one go.The weight is also quite less and the monitor is quite stable on its stand without any particular issues. The picture quality is excellent and one can't ask for a lot more at this price. Hence a full five-star for this."
1,"I bought this monitor a year back. It was working fine till a few days ago when i observed that the monitor had gone black and there are a few lines on screen. I contacted customer care and they asked me to send pictures of the screen. When i sent them, they replied back saying there is a physical damage because of which the screen is damaged and it won't be covered under warranty. But there are no marks on the screen to indicate that there was a physical damage.When i asked the customer care about it, they say if someone had unintentionally pressed the screen a little harder also it would break like this. I had nothing to say to the guy on phone when he said this.So the monitor is cheap. But the screen is very fragile. And if the screen breaks on its own also, it will not be covered under warranty. But the Samsung Customer Care guys were very responsive and supportive. But because it was not covered under warranty, they couldn't help."
1,"1. Purchased this product on 9th Aug2. Delivered on 11th Aug3. During my work on 8th sep i have seen issues with screen display4. Contact Amazon service center and get a suggestion to call Samsung to fix this5. A Samsung representative called me and asked me to share a pic of screen6. Based on screen pic they diagnostic that it is physical damage and do  not cover under warranty7. I asked clarification ""Why is it external damage as it does not have an external mark  from outside""8. They answered - They have this technology without external mark - internal damage can happen and will not cover warranty .9. I contact back to Amazon service representative and they asked letter from Samsung10. I asked for a letter from Samsung  - they sent me a repair cost which is almost the same as product cost11. And now in stuck in between Amazon and Samsung :-)"
5,"You are lucky only if your system is AMD and supports ""Freesync"" technology because with freesync monitor goes up to 72 Hz frequency and then you can see a different quality of movie and game playing.Tips for those who cannot set the monitor at optimized quality.1) In monitor options set ""picture size"" to ""wide"".2) In monitor options set ""freesync""  to ""Ultimate engine"" value  and also turn on ""freesync"" in your graphic driver if it supports. Ignore these settings if your system doesn't support it.3) Go to display adapter settings in windows and set monitor refresh rate to 72 Hz. You can only see 72 Hz option if you enable freesync.4) In monitor settings set contrast to 65, Gamma to mode1 in color setting, Samsung magic upscale to mode1, eye saver mode to off, Game mode to off, Response Time to fastest, eco saving plus to low.5) After finishing all these settings , restart your system.Optional software for better video experience.Download and install madVR renderer. Also download MPC-BE from sourceforge.netInstall MPC-BE , go to its options and set ""Video renderer"" to madVR in video options.Disable all internal filters (Source filters, Video decoders , Audio decoders).In External filters option click ""Add filter"" and select madVR.Now play any Full HD movie or 4K movie in MPC-BE. Your mind will blow away with the quality.8 Gb Ram is minimum these days but atleast 16 Gb Ram  is recommended."
5,"I was so worried after reading the reviews here. Especially that they replace and not return. But the monitor has been great. I don’t use it for gaming. I occasionally watch a movie perhaps but mainly spreadsheet and coding work, works great for me!"
5,"In box VGA cable, power cable with TWO pins and CURVED screen with shiny stand.Back of screen has four screw holes to mount on stand.Headphone jack on the back. Also cable lock hole is there if someone wants to lock it using cable.Curved screen has wow factor, but practically not very useful. Specially for 23 inch screen. if it is big screen like movie hall, then curve has effect but for the small screen, we can live without it.Still I give all stars to Samsung monitor I purchased for office use.  Display colors are good, resolution and brightness all are perfect.I comes with VGA cable, not HDMI, hence I needed to buy separately. I liked that it has two pin power plug, as all computer power plugs are three pins.It has four screw holes on the back so that it can be wall mounted on standard brackets.It is simple to connect and use. Due to curved screen people give second look and like it.Overall good screen and with stunning looks..."
4,"I needed an extended full HD monitor for editing and music composition purposes. And to avail the comfort of not tilting my head much, I opted for the Samsung monitor.Initially I received a faulty product, which did not turn on at all.I reported that to customer service and in literally 24 hours, ie the next day morning I had a replacement waiting at my door step.Great service by Amazon.The installation is super easy. The instruction manual is pretty self explanatory. And the replacement monitor worked like a charm..I had used the monitor for a little over two months I guess and here are the pros and cons and my observations.Suitable for editing ? : NO. Take a hard pass there.Suitable for work from home? : Oh yeah baby!Suitable for music production? : DefinitelySuitable for casual browsing and media consumption? - Sure !How is the quality - The high definition videos Play great if you sit in front of the screen. The detail is there. Absolutely great for media consumption.Colors ? - This is where the problem is. As I said, not for editors or photographers. I tried all combinations of screen adjustments. Big no. Absolutely perfect for general population. Not for film technicians.Viewing angle? - average to be honest. I am the type of guy who sits in front of the PC, so it's cool for me. But if you view from left or right, you see the sceen is almost faded and whitish.Surface? - The back of the monitor is fragile and perhaps made of bad plastic. Gotta handle with care or the board may get damaged. Weight of the device is less.Good for gaming? - naah ! I'm not a gamer. Yet I can say it's not for gaming.Finally, good for work from home, media consumption & reading.Not for gaming, editing or photography editing."
5,Totally waste of money really I bought 15 days before it's coming white border and pixels are not clear totally waste and worst product ever I seen before i bought same monitor in outside shop work perfectly soo moral is don't prefere for online product seriously.......
4,"This is a decent curved monitor considering it’s price. Overall it’s a good display, but it have some downsides as well. My eyes are used to apple’s retina displays. Most of the time i use iPhone, iPad and i can feel the difference between retina and this display. I’m not comparing both displays, because there’s huge price difference in that. So i’ll list the downsides that i found with its display.1- Smaller texts are not that great, even while being black on white. The text are not that smooth and i’m not satisfied with it.2- I don’t know what this issue could be exactly called, but i’ll explain it. I can see very fine horizontal lines on display if we pay closer attention towards it, otherwise it won’t be visible and most likely you’ll not gonna notice it, unless you are doing a light video/photo editing.3- once we turn on eye saver mode, we can’t adjust the brightness. I find it way brighter for my eyes at eye saving mode and the brightness will be at 50% approx when we turn on eye saver mode. As soon as we turn on eye saver mode, the colors just wash out, they look as if we are seeing through a very mild fog. I tried to adjust the contrast in eye saver mode but it didn’t help, so unfortunately i had to switch back to normal mode and adjust the brightness to approx 45% so that it don’t hurt my eyes. Let me be clear to those people who are going to buy this monitor for eye saver mode, better go for some other monitors as the colours just fade away in that mode and don’t look good to watch.I’ll edit my review if i find any other problem or if i find the solution for that issue in eye saver mode."
1,Picture quality is good but when HDMI connected to laptop I feel slight electric passed through my hands whenever I press on my MacBook Air. This is not happening with other monitors in my office. The reason maybe the power cord is only two pin without ground.
3,Noting unique just like any other monitor.  I would give it five stars if it runs for more than 8  yrs as I hardly use it.i have monitors running flawlessly for more than 10yrs.  I am just very annoyed with the user interface is not really exciting You need to do it manually ie no presets.  Also I am not sure why some outlines around images and articles in the web browser appear to be either too light or just too fade to notice.  However pictures and videos seem to be fine. I am very unhappy for the monitor keeps going off and on if someone runs a motor or a sewing machine and also when I turn off the pc monitor is still on for about 10 mins and then it will go off. Honestly I am at the brink of being a detractor only the life of this monitor will change my opinion. But no real issue its ok
5,"This monitor is great.I use this for gaming and graphical works.Good colour reproduction.Brightness and viewing angles are good.Very lightweight.I don't know the reason butMy eyes feel less stressed after working on it.Only con:Led backlight bleeding occurs. When the background is Dark, but not always.Mostly when you're booting an application or game.It doesn't happen while gaming.And if it does, it's so minimal you won't notice."
4,"I really like this monitor.. Just on second day with it... I looks great and bought this for 13K was good. Only set back personally I felt was HDMI input, there is only one, but I have two machines to connect. But, I already have an external HDMI switch with four inputs... so, issue sorted. It is a great buy.Bleeding Problem: I read about bleeding issue on this montior (watched few youtube videos and reviews on that as well). still went for buying due to price. And Yes, it bleeds, but not while you look straight from your sitting position, if you go side to sides looking for bleeding, yes, you can find them clearly. So, not an issue.Others:It don't have any speakers... you need to use audio out jack to connect to an external speaker. It has a VGA input, not so useful for me and you get one VGA cable from the box as well (may be useful for connecting old laptops). Stand is good, but fixed, my table is already a bit above average height, this stand takes the monitor little above my viewing position now, can't find a way of adjusting the height with the stand."
5,"Monitor was good as shown in description , the  box was contain one VGA Cable and power cable. we have to purchase HDMI cable separately ( I recommend AMAZON BASIC HDMI cable ) . the backside of monitor has three ports (such as one VGA, one HDMI and one earphones port) no inbuilt speaks. We can connect 3.5 mm jack for audio , it works good and finally the manual buttons (like. power button, system settings , port changing etc.) are given as joystick type. The amazon packing and shipping also good. thanks to A to Z. Till now i didn't connect with setup box to this monitor, I hope it will works as TV also. some day I will rewrite this review  on setup box and monitor combination. I hope this review is useful for you."
5,I was reading all the reviews for getting a fair idea of the monitor and was in a dilemma of buying it as the first 3 review had only 1 star but the almost 1100+ customers rating it to 4.5 stars so I thought of going for it.There are some pros and cons mentioned below according to me. (Just after a day of usage)Pros1. Thin bezel2. Viewing angle which is great (178 degree horizontal and 178 degree vertical). Hence you don't have any strain no eyes while viewing form different angles.3. Wall mountable.4. Anti glare5. Light weight6. Good resolution as it is Full HD.Cons1. Monitor cannot be adjusted up or down as other monitors.2. There is only one button at the back which is a 5 way joystick for ON/OFF and also to navigate through all the menus. (Usually joysticks are not so durable so not sure about this as you don't have to use the button every time. Hoping for the best)
2,do not buy 2 pieces together if you need extended screen. i hv bought 2 sets and colors of display of both are different. my purpose of buying  was to get same colors of screens but now i am helpless because can not get replaced or return.
4,"Many people seem to complain about bleeding and other things, when clearly it is not designed for that sort of functionality. It's simple physics, because of it's curvature, no matter how you look at it, the bezels WILL show this ""bleeding"" as they are emitting light for the display; and if you're going to buy this monitor for only pointing out this ""bleeding"" effect (unless its a defect) then I suggest you return this product and look elsewhere as this is the best price-to-performance gaming monitor out there.Now for the review; this monitor is among the best 1080p monitors out there, especially for a 27"" display. The packaging is fairly simple and straightforward, with easy access to all the parts; however, please take care to remove the monitor last AFTER you have affixed the in-built stand, as it will be easier for handling and setting it up.The joystick is precise and quite audible for a haptic interface, confirming each selection of the menu with a nice audible click. However, the menu options are a bit lacking, for example, when connected to my computer, I cannot adjust the brightness of the screen, nor do I get the option in the control panel; this is one of the reasons I reduced a star from the Overall rating (in case anyone else has a solution, please feel free to correct me). Apart from that, the EyeCare+ technology is good, increasing brightness while reducing the Blue spectrum to protect your eyes even at night but still provide a good gaming experience.The assembly of the monitor is fairly easy, where you screw the base to the ""stem"" of the monitor stand, and can be done by hand; an excellent thinking on Samsung's part to provide a revolving handle on the screw for this purpose, you would've needed a Philips No 2 screw driver for the assembly otherwise.Another negative feedback to Samsung however, is to include DVI cables instead of HDMI cables; almost all modern GPU's and motherboards now come with HDMI ports or Display Ports cables, while DVI cables are becoming redundant. Please start including the same, especially of you advertise it as a gaming monitor; such monitors will almost always be paired with a PC system dedicated for gaming, meaning it will have a discrete graphics card, and hence HDMI or Display ports.Lastly, the display itself; the monitor has a very high refresh rate and when paired with an AMD graphics card, will give extremely smooth displays on the AMD FreeSync technology. Physically though, in case the viewing angle doesn't feel right, you can tilt monitor vertically, by pushing either the top of the display bezel or pulling it; please take care NOT to press the panel as it can damage the display, neither I, nor Samsung, will take responsibility if the tilting of the monitor is done incorrectly and ends up damaging the panel (this feature, rather strangely, is NOT given in the manual).Finally, let the graphics software analyse the monitor and define the recommended display settings for the monitor, which usually sits at 1920x1080. In case you have discrete graphics, I would recommend leaving the recommended settings as it is."
5,"Replaced my 10 yr old HP v15 screen with this. My desktop got a whole new life. The screen is excellent. Great picture quality and the curve give a premium feel. My desktop user experience does not make me feel that I am using a 10 yr old system.Well, i got a good spec machine. And this suits the need."
4,"The box contains only vga cable and no hdmi cable so i think they should have provided it in the box since it is no where near cheap. Using with vga initially i was seeing wavy lines but when i connected my laptop to the powerline then it was gone, might be possible that it is due to electric issues only with me. The picture quality when using hdmi is perfect no issues whatsoever,  the audio is also transfered in sync and the aux port can be used with either headphones or home theater(also cable not included).People are complaining about the screen bleeding issue but i have not encounterd it with my unit and even when watching movies it provides a good experience, keep in mind that you will have black bars at the top and bottom because of the aspect ratio as this is not an ultrawide monitor.Another con might be that the monitor has no adjustments for viewing angle or height so you will have to either keep it on a stand or some old books if you want to make it at your eye level. The curvature is there but doesn't feel like you have any benefit of the curvature unless you have two monitors. I bought this just for the heck of it being curved and satisfy my desire to use it before the tech dying away and i am not at all disappointed. If you are getting this around 8k then it is a worth purchase, i bought it when it was priced at around 9.5k which seems more than what it is offering"
4,"Ok it came early so it was good....packing was nice...easy to installPros :- Amazing picture quality, curved screen really eases the eye to look at screen, doesn't heat up even after long use (Full Day) , slim fits perfectly at you small desk tooCons :- alright only one con side is the stand doesn't seem to be strong it feels like it will break easily it wobbles even a slight movement of the table.Just that over all good stuff in 10k no regrets so far...would update if fond some thing new."
4,"Purchased 27inch model. Very nice monitor. Cinema mode is good but for normal desktop work you will have to customize brightness sharpness and contrast between 50 and 80 as per your taste in custom mode. This will avoid too much of everything and black levels will look good. Game mode is making edges more sharper which i didnt like. Under custom settings as suggested white light bleed in edges will also reduce. Angle views are also good. For photo editing and exact color repriduction go for an ips panel. But ips panel might get burnt images in panel  if u leave system in same page for long time. Unfortunately i cldnt use freesync since i have nvidia. Sticking to 60hz. In freesync it goes till 90hz as i heard so.While watching movies in some modes i noticed image jittering then and there. In custom mode didnt notice that after some time. Eye saving mode is good but it adds more brightness with yellowtint. So we can use custom settings in monitor and windows 10 night mode which worked well. Disable samsungs eye saving mode.To consolidate its a very good monitor for gaming, work and watching movies."
5,Samsung makes some of the best products in the world and this monitor is amazing for gamers. Absolutely one of the best in the market and much better than most others. I am using this as the primary display in a rig I hooked up for my kids. It was long overdue. The picture is crystal clear and the rendering is amazing. I am totally bowled over the colors and the brilliance of the display. Full screen gaming on this monitor is breath-taking. The display is huge. Any bigger and I think the neck muscles will start to ache from incessant twisting back and forth to keep up with the display. This size is just perfect. Large but manageable for the neck.I am using a Asus TUF Gaming X570-PLUS motherboard with a AMD Ryzen-5 3600 MHz 6-Core processor with a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM. My graphics card is ASUS Radeon RX 580 8GB Dual-Fan OC Edition GDDR5. The PSU is Corsair RM650. I'm using two hard disks in this. The booting is a Western Digital WD Blue SSD 250 GB SATA III and the bulk storage is a standard 1 TB Seagate Baracuda as the secondary. All this is housed in a Corsair Carbide Series CC-9011050-WW cabinet. I'm using this Samsung 27 inch Curved LED Backlit Computer Monitor and a Redgear Pro Series Wired Gamepad. The keyboard mouse combo is a Redgear Manta MT21 Gaming Keyboard. The sound is from a F&D F-203G 2.1 Channel Multimedia Speakers System. Everything is bought here on Amazon within days of each other and it is perfectly matched.I recommend this monitor and whole matched setup to anyone interested in building a top-of-the-line gaming computer that will not be outdated anytime soon.Highly recommended.
1,"This monitor need 16AMP socket. This is crazy specification, not sure why Samsung gives 16AMP plug  got a device that hardly consumes 50watt. Avoid buying this monitor."
5,Best budget monitor in this price
2,I like packaging! And no damage as i expected!About led Its work amazing but back light bleeding...Its start flicking so i try to return 2 time.i recognized it was a problem with windows 10 auto color picking..Thumbs Up for great product ....Its worth for money 14K but i think its comes to 12K for good
5,"I have purchased this product at ₹13300. Its been one month. This is great product in this price range.The best feature of this monitor is it is very slim, I mean it is ultra slim. The picture quality is very good.The white color of this monitor is very beautiful.I purchased it for work purpose. Some time I watch movies on it. 75hz refresh rate good for gaming. I played GTA 4 on it. The was running very smoothly on this monitor.I have got some cables like HDMI, VGA, Audio and power cable. The quality of cables is awesome.Thanks"
5,1) Display clarity is superb2) Price is affordable3) No flickering at all4) Can work for long times without any stress on eyes5) Colors are true (While playing games and watching videos)
4,"This monitor fits the purpose and I would definitely recommend it. Please note, you have to buy external speakers with this and cant wall mount it.Picture quality - 4/5 in dark backgrounds at times streched objects appear pixelated if you move very close to the monitor. Not a deal breaker.No screen glare and viewing angles are good.Design - 4.5/5 The monitor looks amazing being so slom and white. The base and monitor conection could be improved to introduce a locking mechanism. Now its slide and keep. With the monitor being so slom there is no wall or bracket mount available - which is fine as you are trading that functionality for the monitor to be super slim.Speaker 2/5 - 2 watts is very less, dont expect to use the monitor speaker, think of it as an additional unit which will never be used.Inputs 3.5/5 1 hdmi and 1 vga port which allows me to connect both my personal and work laptop at the same time.Switching between the 2 requires 4 switch presses in the settings and takes about 15 secs. It would have been great if there were a quick toggle switch to change between hdmi and vga inputs respectivelyPrice 5/5 - after some research, this appears to be the best option as per price.Overall value for money or ROI - 4.5/5P.S havent tested it for gaming, its used as an extended display for my work and personal laptops"
5,"The monitor is very good. It's very thin and looks very elegant. The picture quality is also excellent. Assembly was simple enough.Overall, for the price, this is a steal. The pros far outweigh the cons.Cons :Height is not adjustable.Has only audio input, but no audio out!The quality of inbuilt speakers is not good, the max volume is too low to be useful.The monitor far exceeded my expectations."
5,The monitor is huge. 27inch was way too big for me.❤️ Picture quality crisp and clear.❤️ 75Hz refresh rate and 1080p IPS LCD. So color reproduction is fine AF.❤️ The screen has a matte kind of finish so you don't see any kind of reflections even if the light source is behind your head.❤️ It's extremely thin and modern looking. The white adds some elegance to it.❤️ Bezels are kinda non-existent.Go for it. You're never going to regret any of the money spent.
1,"Too much backlight bleeding..not happy at all with the product. I have 3 other monitors, 2 from BenQ and one from Dell and there is no backlight bleeding in them.This monitor does not meet my expectations even though it is good interms of design but backlight bleeding is not what I needed"
5,"I am So impressive look prity, value for money,So slim,"
5,"Great monitor for 13k price. Only problem is that the screen is soo big, that 1080p resolution seems low quality. If the resolution was atleast 2k for this big screen, it would be totally cool. But overall a really awesome monitor"
5,Very happy with the monitor27 inch is very good size- light weight- white color is just too good (have to order keyboard /mouse and the CPU box in whites though)- resolution is perfect- good for teachers/programmers/meetings/video calls- low wattage speakers is JUST FINEGreat buy
3,The monitor is great. Elegant look. Works great.But only problem which I faced was the backlight bleeding issue. I returned it and got it replaced. But the backlight bleed issue was still there. So finally decided to return and go for some other monitor.Also don't expect too much from the inbuilt speakers.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"This monitor has good colors in display and has a very classy look with the white bottom and back. The only better thing that could have been provided was a couple of USB ports which are not present.Haven't used it for gaming, so can't comment about that."
4,Overall display is very good as picture quality also you want  gaming on this display pls buy.I have faced issue with display. I have received damaged products. Display is bleeding on right Side and top side but I have checked tha picture quality is very good and value of money... For gaming....
5,"The monitor is beautiful so is the color accuracy and the screen. Loved it. No backlight bleeding although had to get a replacement once since the first delivered product had backlight bleeding, but the replacement is perfect. Buy this monitor without a doubt if you are looking for a budget 27 inch ips panel with 75hz refresh rate. Also the monitor is aesthetically beautiful and super slim."
1,An absolutely defective and broken product was sent to me. Don't even buy anything from acer and specially from amazon. It was amazon fulfilled product and screen was completely defective tilting bottom. Save yourself from harassment and don't buy anything from amazon. It is disgusting how big name like. Amazon is looting people. They are shameless and need to be taken to consumer court. Save your money and don't buy anything from. Amazon specially electronics. Better to go to market see things check and buy them.
5,"Quality is A+. You won't be getting a better product at this price point.If u do have a graphics card then it's even better for you ☺️...Though i dont use it for gaming, I use it to watch movies and office work.Clarity is superb."
2,"The screen is beautiful, but the monitor is only in one position. You cannot adjust the angle (horizontal and vertical) of the monitor.Very disappointed.The audio output is bad, no use of inbuilt audio."
4,"Got it for 11,000 - 27 inch monitor and worth for money. I am using it for around 4-5 now and this product was good.  This product is very light."
2,Video Player is loading.
3,For that price it may ok. But lookwise not that great. I don't have an HDMI port. So can't say about picture quality. VGA quality is ok. An above average product.
5,"With WFH being the new normal, I went ahead and invested in this monitor and it has improved my working experience tremendously. Now I have more screen real estate to work comfortably and not get stressed out. It feels so much comfortable.Picture quality is also amazing. And the price - Very reasonable for the offering."
3,"This is a good product for this price range . Bought it during the lock down period in 2020. Picture quality is awesome. Though many say it looks great, i wouldn't agree as it has a plasticky feeling. The Audio quality of this product is not so good. Even if you set the volume to the maximum, it doesn't sound like it.Apart from that, I am satisfied with the product and the delivery."
5,"I bought for 15,490 and still feel that it should not be more than 14K.In build speaker are pitmatic, laptop speaker are better than monitors."
5,Product is good for the value.Very bad experience about Amazon delivery. I was about to cancle the order for giving false reasons for delay in delivery.
4,"Not frameless at all on 3 sides... Acer calls if the bezel is less if the frame is less than 0.8 inches so don't get disappointed after purchase as there is no return option than.... secondly, the AMD sync will only work if the AMD GPU is being used"
1,"Stero speaker sound is very feeble, even my laptop voice was much better than it. Might be a defect and got to know from amazon customer service that the item can't be replaced because of restrictions from seller"
3,"Speaker quality is so bad that you cannot even watch a small video, it is very basic speaker in the monitor. Also the brightness is so high that your eyes get strained even at 5% of brightness."
5,"I am using this with Mac Book Air connected via HDMI.It's an awesome monitor to leverage for office use.I use it for coding,Presentation and video editing."
5,VERY NICE AT LEAST 10 PURCHSE
5,Acer IPS MONITOR is very good 👍👍👍👍
5,Nice product good ultra slim.
5,"Value for money, good picture quality, Not bad for gaming"
5,Good one. Delivered perfectlyGood packing. Working perfectly.
5,☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️👍👍
4,Packaging and quality goodScreen size and feature are good also it provide 2 stereo speaker but sound quality is bad by the way quality and performance good.
4,Really nice picture quality . Happy with my purchase
5,Nice product. Exact solution for my trading requirement. Extremely happy with this deal.
4,As usual my review would be on end user side rather than being technical.1.First of all the screen have thin bezzels and it is not bezelsless.When it is switch off it gives you a fake promise of bezzeless due to its protection film cum glass.2.Why I have purchased it.I need a wide screen for my wildlife film editing and I have one more samsung 27 inch curved HD monitor for content viewing.3.1080p vs 4K yeah its true you will see the pixel but only you will focus your eye on screen from a 4CM distance.While working with a normal sitting position this is awesome.4.Who should buy.A  Video editor (pro and advance )or by a photo editor.A big No for Gamer this is made for more on budget centric commercial sector then for a pro gamer.You will like it while editing movies with any software like sony vega filmora or adobe primier .Multitasking Yes it is very easy for them.Casual game.It can be but I would suggest to go for a more 100hz refresh rate and delay responce.The thing which I dont like it there is no height adjustment in stand.I/O port are limited.No inbulit speaker but most of the movies editor has Studio Speaker.HDR:Buy it for everything but not HDR.It just a vivid+ mode note an HDR but still it looks pretty (at least for me)Material:Plastic.Stand are made of metal and plastic which looks goodFinal verdict:If you are video editor no matter whether u are pro or beginner just go for it.At this price range this is the best but if you have a budget go for min 2K resolution.Gamers:Unfortunately mates this is not for youMultitaskers/programmers:Close you eyes and buy.Entertainment: Can be but wide screen is not recommended without a curve for Entertainment1 star is missing as there is no hight adjustmentConsidering the price tag this nice product from LG
1,Cons:1. the main feature of the display is to use the on screen display for multi tasking. However i found that the CD provided doesn't have the on screen control software. I looked in the lg website and it says no so software available.This makes the display less useful.2. Also the advertised HDR10 effect while playing movies is not great. it looks over saturated.
5,"After a lot of reviews on ultrawide displays, I was lucky enough to find this under a price of 25k on Prime Sale. I’m using this for design purpose primarily, video editing and viewing HD movies. The wide screen helps in splitting screens and comes really handy in the WFH scenario. So far the experience has been splendid, I’d add additional review post a month of use. Delivery was smooth and arrived next day."
4,"Got this monitor for my WFH setup. Serves the purpose but some facts you should know before buying , my personal views on those :1. Very wide , better than 2 multi monitors .2. Color accuracy is spot on , eye candy for movie and videos consumption.3. Monitor looks sleek and awesome when switched off as well.4. Great for ultrawide gaming as well fantastic colors with 75Hz refresh is a very good feature for this monitor.5. This supports HDR 10 and it looks good , but keep in mind its not the HDR picture mode in settings. HDR is totally dependent on your PC . Anything lower than intel 7th gen and nvidia 1000 series wont support HDR. And if your PC supports HDR then you can enjoy it on this monitor without setting it to any mode(default).Why gave it a 4 star :1. As few others have pointed out , the split screen feature is not available out of box , I haven't used it till now.2. A little disappointing , but the multi input seems to be gone from this model WL500 which was present in WK500 😪.3. A very important thing to know , this is a 2560*1080 p monitor , I am used to a 14 inch laptop with that 1080p resolution. The 34 inch will definitely have a lack of Ppi and hence the text and icon quality is really bad. If you intend to use it only for office work or productive work I would say dont buy this big monitor with such low resolution. (One point , I sit around 3 feet from the monitor)Ps. If you want to see more lines of code or more text from a file at a time , you are going to be disappointed bcoz of how distorted the text looks 😢I bought this monitor only because I have just started working , and my budget was hovering around 15-18k. I got this at 25.5k in Prime day sale , so just got it. And 1440p uktrawides are crazy expensive !! almost 50-60k more just for that resolution bump !!!I am totally happy with this monitor for media and color accuracy. But the small texts look really bad. The skype application on windows looks pathetic , so i have to use it on my laptop only. Please keep that in mind and go for this monitor.Though there is a trick you can apply by supersampling with help on your dedicated GPU (Not Laptop). That may give better results. I have only laptops so can't try that yet.Overall get this if you consume a lot of media as well as need a bigger screen real estate monitor. But know that text is going to look bad and that's a sacrifice you gotta make at this price range."
5,"For quite some time I had wanted to get a dual monitor setup but the mess of setting up of two monitors with their stands was also bothersome. So I decided to go for an Ultrawide monitor also thinking of the future updates i would be making to my workstation. When I received this product and connected with my existing cable, i was upset that it wasn't clear enough and everything was looking so dull and faded. I started looking around solutions where people were writing scripts to darken the page for ultrawide monitors. After using it for 2-3days, I hated it and wanted to return but as a last ditch effort, I connected it with the cable that came with this and all of a sudden, an Avataristic display sprung to life! This monitor is amazing and deserves every bit of recognition among developers as its of perfect size and fits everything I want in it. And, its relatively cheap! Absolutely no complaints, even though its not 4K, it does not matter, the resolution and the HDR have filled my plate. I was having some trouble connecting this via thunderbolt 2 port on my macbook but was able to get that working with 4K Belkin MiniDP to HDMI Adaptor (has to be 4K even if the monitor isn't 4K, it surpasses the 1080p resolution, it being 2560x1080 and thats why needs a 4K adapter) I also use a macOS app called Lunar to control volume and brightness right from my macOS instead of the physical controls"
5,"I needed one good big monitor instead of multiple smaller monitor for my trading. This has fulfilled my purpose. This is good. I don't play games so don't know much about it. However, this is good for watching videos too. One can buy it."
4,"What a buyer must know but is not clearly brought out in the description of LG UW 34 inch WFHD IPS Display -1. The HDMI cable needed must be Mini Display Port ( mini DP) to HDMI type, if you want to connect it with Macbook. Do check if your PC/ Laptop has mini DP or regular HDMI slot. The cable supplied is suited for standard HDMI slot. I wish one more cable with miniDP to HDMI was also included, since this monitor supports two separate inputs  (from Different PC).2. There is some time delay in refreshing of charts occasionally. I use Trading View and Kite platforms for trading.  I have been refreshing the whole chart manually occasionally.3. Please note, that this monitor allows display of input from either of the two computers connected. So, there is a possibility that multiple programs running from your laptop which you display in various windows ( upto four split screens) may result in slow down. If you want two windows to be input from one PC and the other two from another PC so as to ensure that speed of the programs being run/ charts being displayed is not affected, this monitor WILL NOT serve the purpose. For eg. I have to run myFnO, Trading View, Zerodha Kite charts from the single PC - Macbook in my case, and this results in a lag in refreshing of charts in Trading View/ MyFNO/ Kite.So serious traders who can afford may like to choose next higher model of LG and spend another 10K or so."
4,"The primary purpose of my purchase was to use it for my home office setup. Besides my office work, I use it for web browsing, media consumption, non professional photo and video editing. After 2 weeks of usage, following are my thoughts:1. I was initially looking for a curved QHD monitor and the prices for even the 2016 models were around INR 85K. At INR 27K it is a solid buy. QHD monitor will have a much better resolution but this monitor serves my purpose2. I would not recommend it to a professional photo or video editor. I would rather suggest going for a 16:9 aspect ratio 4K panel3. For multitasking it is awesome. The OnScreen software comes in real handy. One criticism is that the monitor came with no instructions for downloading the OnScreen software. The LG India website does not list it in the Software & Support category for this model number. However, I realized that it is same software for all models. I ended up downloading it from the LG US website by typing in an alternate model number. Works like a charm4. It is great for media consumption aswell. Given the 21:9 aspect ratio, for most of the youtube content, end up seeing black bars to the right and left. However, I find the content still immersive5. There are 2 HDMI ports and 1 audio out. It is adequate for me but it will not be future proof6. I really wished that this monitor had in-built speakers. I use my bluetooth headset instead7. I did not try gaming on this monitor but 60Hz/75Hz refresh rate will be ok for casual but not competitive gaming8. The stand that came with the monitor is just ok. While it is stable, the monitor has a tendency to wobble a little bit while typing hard on the keyboard. The monitor can be only tilted up and down. There is no ability to adjust height.In conclusion this monitor is a good value for money despite a few missing features"
5,"I had been using LG 27inch for about a year and that was good - but split screen would constrict the width a bit too much. LG 34 inch ultra wide is perfect for those who need to work on two windows simultaneously - ample width for seamless work.Picture clarity is awesome. Monitor controls are via a small joystick, using which you control the picture settings per your need - provides quite a few options.No flicker - very stable display.Improvement areas: For wall mount, VESA holes are provided in a cavity - so you need longer screws to attach the bracket. Also, the HDMI/ power ports are behind the monitor and connector point outwards - so, when you wall mount, they hit the all.... would have been better if the ports are provided facing sidewards..... If to be used for table stand - its perfect..."
4,"I purchased it and today it is 25.01.2021 almost 2 month after purchase, I found it very good for seeing charts in a big monitor. Far(10 times) better then a laptop monitor. Your trading will get better and overview in market will change drastically if you start using big monitor. Though split screen is not of much use if you don't owe any good trading software, but in zerodha you can use it for two screens/four screens and, those two screens will help you seeing chart in better way. If you want to make a trading setup with this monitor it is good monitor atlease you should have one, monitor like this."
4,Pros1. Excellent for multitasking. (Use 6 to 8 Excel sheets together)2. Screen Split software by LG is great but a bit slow.3. 34 Inch Wide screen format makes work flow a lot easier very seamlessly.4. Matt finish is great for direct sunlight use. (However max brightness could have been better)Cons1. The company stand does not have any movement in height or any other axis. (Bought an Amazon basics Stand)2. If you are used to 4K laptops the display quality is just adequate.3. No built in speakers just in case you want to use a fire tv stick to play content.
5,"34WL500 - Firstly I brought this monitor for 21500 INR after applying offer (1500 INR on credit card). Was looking at the reviews and the price of this monitor for a long time, price was fluctuating between 27k and 25k and the negative reviews were mainly due to gaming. When the price came down to 23k, I decided to go after this. My intended usage is for VirtualBox running on laptop and display for my desktop PC ( no gaming). The split screen and dual control works like a charm. You can download the software from LG website for any 34 inch monitor. Only negative I see here is height is not adjustable, but for my home setup this was not an issue. For this price range I doubt you'll get a 34"" widescreen monitor. Setup is very easy, probably less than 5 minutes to get it up running, LG also provided a Hdmi cable. And finally thanks to Amazon for delivering it before the scheduled delivery date."
5,"So big and best setup for Video Editing and Gaming!I use this mostly for video Edit and Trading!So amazing and the big 34 helps the edit panel very convenient for editing and for Trading, having four charts at once helps me track easily!Simply go for it if your budget is 30k"
4,"I use Dell U2415 (24inch 16:10 ratio 1920x1200) Dual Monitor Setup at work as well as at home .  So my comparison of this is based on that.  I bought this when I moved to my  hometown due to covid19. The screen real estate is good enough for those who are used to two 24inch monitors. You don't have to pan you head like a dual monitor setup. The effect of lost screen real estate is small since there is no bezel in the middle here. Unlike Dell ultra-sharp monitors, this has a physical menu joystick. The touch sensitive menu buttons on dell monitors are really annoying and the menu changes when there is no input detected and they take while to switch inputs . In this one when a new input is detected , there is an OSD popup informing that. There is a headphone out which gets audio through HDMI, volume can be adjusted using the joystick.I use this with the integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620) on my laptop. I find the image quality to be normal.  This is a decent monitor for work from home. May not the be the best option if you watch streaming videos. The videos on Amazon Prime and others are 1920x1089, even when the original content is 21:9, the streaming services adds padding. The 21:9 content on youtube is very limited.Things I did not like-Power button is using menu joystick, would love a separate power button.No USB hub. I wanted a DP over USB C, but that model is just announced by LG and not yet available in India.No DP port - It is standard now in almost all big monitors.The plastic feels and looks really cheap and is uneven in some places.The vertical resolution of 1080 is not a future proof one for gaming.HDMI cable included is not very good quality one."
5,"LG always produce good products. This is also an excellent product.After struggling initially with my mac pro 13' I am able to use the display at 2560x1080, 75Hz. Initially I was not able to use LG on screen software. It says No monitor connected. I connected with windows laptop and then connect back to mac. now everything seems to ok. This might be bug.Split screen works like a charm. I am happy with this since it increases my productivity to put windows side by side.Overall I am fully satisfied. Thanks Amazon for selling this kind of monitors."
5,"This is extremely good for Working, acts as two monitors.Controls : Joystick works pretty well to control Brightness, Contrast, volume and etc..No inbuilt speaker, works well with externals.Couldn't find the software to split screen, not even in LG support. Got the installer from a friend and its working good.Never tried for Gaming, so no review for Gaming :)"
3,"Good ultra wide screen. But the main feature that I bought this, that is split screen doesn't work. The software that you need to install from LG website, gets installed but it never opens and keeps erroring out. Event viewer in windows shows that the application has thrown an exception. I tried many ways to get rid of the error but with no success. Only LG can fix it. they have to update their software. The main purpose for which I bought the monitor has failed. I am not happy with the purchase."
1,"Actually #amazon delivered me damaged product, with alternate serial number on bill (nobody can replace their product until the pickup delivery boy will match the serial number of  bill and device) the serial number of my bill is diffrent from the device got delevered to me. And now it is about to happen almost 3 months from my delivery and there is not a single positive response from the team amazon regarding this and i lost my hopes and patience for this complain, atlast please avoid buying expensive products from these sites, you may also get damaged product delivered to you which may affect as loss for your business tools and i am facing problems as student nobody is here to listen me. Hope this review and pictures will help to the consumers."
5,I purchased it for my brother's studio and it solves the purpose of mixing the songs on a big screen. Looking also so beautiful on table as you can see in the pic. Love this monitor but it's extra wide so it's for only those who can make a use of it purposely
1,Disappointed 🙄 backlight bleeding...I requested for a Replacement and  the request was granted. But have not  picked up the monitor yet.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,"I received thi monitor yesterday and on installing and switching ON, it shows only defective LED lines all accross the screen. Have immediately asked for replacment. Very upset as this was certainly not expected from a brand like LG !Will update status as it happens."
4,Video Player is loading.
1,"Was delivered on 19/Aug/2020 and its not even 3 months since I have started using it. Now there is a vertical blue line that has appeared on the screen and doesn't seem to go away. It's very frustrating to look at, especially while working. Please advice if anyone has faced such issues and was able to get it fixed or get it replaced."
3,"Pixelated texts. I have a Macbook pro as the main laptop. This monitor is a big let down. I bought mainly for office work ( word docs/ Excel sheets), pixelated texts. I should have gone for a 4K monitor even with a bigger price point. Or better,  buy a 24 or 27 inch monitor at best and save the additional money. At 25k it is a waste for me. Amazon refused for return, I would have upgraded for a 4k monitor."
5,"I bought 34WL500 from Amazon and found resolution 2560x1080 which is bad for screen size 34 inch. Atleast 2k(2560x1440).Texts were little blur, I started getting headache in 5 min of use.But here Amazon does amazing things....I was worried that the monitor was only replaceable. But Amazon accepted the return and returned the product.Thank you Amazon."
5,"It took a while to get this running well. I have a 2017 Intel Macbook Air and the recommended settings for this display is higher. This needed me to do my own research and invest in a lightning to HDMI dongle that could transfer the data faster.To get split screen organization, you will need to download software from LG. And this model is not listed. So I downloaded software for something that looked like this display from LG's US website. All of which needed research.So to get this display to work the way I want took an additional 2-3 weeks of work. Once this is done, you are in good shape."
5,"The build quality is great, it's not thin like most LED TV, but it feels strong, the display brightness is way more then what I expected, I have a macbook pro 2019 and this display is brighter then that, I recommend use HDR or vivid mode for better experience, All the ports work well, the display or the adapter don't get hot with 38°C room temperature. Well I miss the retina display of my mac because in retina and oled displays black color looks great but in this screen it is not that great, although in full black pixels you won't feel differences in the screen, the light scatters properly and it really feels premium. Overall it's a good display 34 inch is way larger then what I expected you guys should buy this."
5,A very good screen with lot of options and it has a very good features like splitting up the screen in multiple windows and can do multitasking at the same time. I think its little pricy for this configuration. It has very good picture quality but not exactly 4k and brightness of the screen is also good for getting what you want see with battery saving options if necessary.
1,THE monitor got broken within a few days......amazon failed to replace. its customer service was arrogant and useless. though this product sale was fulfilled by amazon it did not behave so.so
4,"Bought this monitor for my 2016 MBP 15"" and works flawlessly.Design is outdated with clunky buttons and thick bezels, but that display, oh boy! Is very good.This is my first ever HDR display and it makes MBP screen's colors look a bit washed away. My laptop screen is noticeably sharper(Especially for 1080p content), thanks to its nearly twice dense ppi, but for 4k content this monitor is very good!A usb hub would have made this a perfect monitor, but I was planning on getting a thunderbolt dock anyway. Read some online reviews opining that this is a better display compared to  similarly priced acer et322qk."
5,"31.5 inches of real estate, 4K, USB-C and HDR (though the brightness isn't enough to really call it true HDR, you need minimum 500 nits for that).You can't ask for more at a price of 33-34k.The display is gorgeous, and thanks to the incredible contrast ratio of 3000:1, you can even use it as a smart TV with a Firestick 4K or Mi Box 4k (I got this).I'm a designer so I got it because of the color accuracy and it delivers perfectly. I can barely distinguish the colours from my 16"" MacBook Pro display.Keep in mind, it's a VA panel and not IPS panel so you might feel the colours are not as punchy but again, the contrast ratio (3000:1) is a lot superior (IPS panels usually have 1000:1) as a result which means your blacks look closer to black than the dark greys you instead see on IPS panels."
5,"In all aspects (Quality, Performance, Price, etc) this monitor is better. Those who are looking for 32-inch UHD can consider this one.This monitor doesn't offer PIP, PBP features which is not a deciding factor for me."
4,"Removed one star because benq neither provide app for monitor settings nor for split screen.Its VA Panel so images degrades slightly if viewed at an angle.Blacks are much deeper and uniform than IPS panel, loves it. Just like IPS glow on IPS panel, there is very very little VA glow, doesnot bother much. Audio is pathetic.Its really better than LG 32UD59 (VA panel) in image quality. which costs Rs 45k.Monitor is too heavy that my table mount monitor  arm can't handle it."
4,"I wanted to get a big monitor for software development.My requirement was:1. A 4k panel, preferably IPS2. 32 or 34 inch3. Eye care features like higher refresh rate (although I am not a gamer)4. Good ergonomics - height, tilt, rotate5. Acceptable sound6. Budget up to 40kSadly, No monitor ticked all my needs. After spending too much time comparing all available options in my budget, finally ordered this. Other contenders were Benq PD3200Q and LG Ultragear 32. Dropped due to 2k resolution. Since 2k at 32 inch is same as full hd at 24 inch (my existing monitor).Went with Benq EW3270U, since it it has 4k resolution and eye care features. The shortcomings were not major factors for me.Review:1. Display: Very good for programming. I have scaled up the sizes of items by 100% using windows settings. Still I can see two files side by side. Big test is easier on the eyes.2. Auto brightness: Tried it at night. It was too bright for me. So turned off and manually reduced brightness to 20.3. Adjustments: My table is a bit too tall. This monitor doesn't have height adjustment. So I need to look up. Will get a separate monitor stand to fix this.4. Connectivity: Tried HDMI. One slot didn't work - didn't detect signal. Second one worked, but resolution was only full HD. Switch to USB 3 cable, and working fine. Only problem is that the supplied USB 3 cable is short.5. Sound: Surprise! Many reviewers have said that sound is too low. I found that there is a setting in monitor controls to adjust volume. By default, they have set it to 30% (stupid decision IMO). I increased it to 100%, and it is louder than I can tolerate."
5,"Monitor is big. It's like you have 4 16 inch monitors together. great for productivity. But, it will take time to adjust.I mainly bought for office work, i don't play any games.Main thing to remember is cables given with the monitor are fully futuristic and you may not be able to use immediately.Cable 1: Both sides USB type C of USB 3.1Cable 2: Monitor side DP port, laptop side mini DP.I wasn't able to use both cables to connect monitor to laptop even though my laptop is very recent laptop.My laptop which is Lenovo X390 only has USB type A USB 3.1 and a HDMI port.So, i had to buy another HDMI cable to use the monitor.28 inch variant of the same monitor comes with a DP port on both sides though.Another disadvantage is there is no height adjustment or side adjustment. Only adjustment is -5 to 15 facing adjustment.Just 4 days now, will update review after rigorous usage.Review after a week. I have a lenovo thinkpad x390 and lenovo thinkpad thunderbolt 3 dock. Monitor is not getting detected automatically on connecting to dock. Manually i have to remove the cable and reconnect to detect after starting the laptop. If i restart, settings are retained, but if i shut down, settings are lost and again on starting laptop, i have to manually remove the cable and connect again."
5,"First of all, this is an amazing monitor for the price! I highly recommend it if you do a creative works as a profession/hobby which requires color accuracy. I do 3D art and work with colours a lot and this monitor is just a lot of fun to work with! I'm coming from a FHD monitor and experiencing this 4k monitor is just amazing, everything is super crisp and clear!That being said you will have to do some color calibration on the monitor. The whites and gamma on the monitor were absolutely trash when I turned it on for the first time. Colours were okay though. The white balance is completely off and is orange-redish.  The gamma is off too and makes everything looks washed out, blacks appear grey, etc. I don't have a colour calibration tool but I managed to do it with the windows colour management software. If you have a pre calibrated monitor at home, you can use that as a reference like how I did.After calibration, the monitor is just amazing. It left me speechless. 100% recommend you to colour calibrate the monitor.I've attached images, A is calibrated, B is before calibration. Images were shot with manual exposure, white balance and ISO. It's not an accurate representation but should give you an idea."
5,Video Player is loading.
2,The monitor in itself is just mind blowing. But a cluster of dead pixel right in center of screen. I saw on Benq website they dont replace panel in warranty if there are less than 6 dead pixels. This is just unacceptable. So I returned it the day after. Although the resolution is so high that u cant notice in daily use. But you will definetley notice when something white or light appears on screen over dead pixels
5,"This is a great monitor for its price. Good screen response, accurate color representation. Brightness is satisfactory and i have never been able to use the monitor at max brightness. Some nifty things about the monitor:Usb c (included inside the box) connects without hassle with my macbook air m1. 4k output.No HDMI supplied with the monitor (which is terrible in my opinion). However, i already had a high speed hdmi cable which i used to connect the monitor with my xbox one x. Great gaming monitor with peppy colors.All in all, a great buy if you want to use the monitor with your laptop and gaming console. The size never gave me any aches and pains, contrary to some of the reviews here. 32in is a comfortable size to have. But that is entirely subjective."
5,Using it for my PS5. It has very crispy and colorful display. HDR works great and even the eye sensor is very accurate.No issues with eye strain or colors being displayed inaccurately.Very good monitor for this price range. Amazon took around 10 days to deliver it to Mumbai.
4,"This is my second PC monitor from the same company. Several years ago, when there were no 24 inch monitors in the market, BenQ was one of the first to launch a good monitor of that size and competitive price.  Few years ago, when 32 inch monitors were uncommon, many like me had to settle down with FHD TV for work and casual gaming. With 32 inch monitors becoming common now a days, BenQ EW3270U definitely stands apart.It is that cost-to-performance ratio that sets it apart. Similar monitors from LG or Samsung cost more. Some of the impressive features are:1. Almost natural reproduction of colors. This is a VA panel. So no complaint on the colors.2. Brightness levels are quite satisfactory. The display is crisp.3. Loads of custom picture modes and tweaks available with a relatively easy-to-navigate menu interface.4. Excellent 4k resolution. Refresh rate is 60Hz max.Certain things to take into account.1. Not a swivel base. Top-bottom view angles can only be adjusted with the monitor base.2. Only for straight-viewing. View angles are pretty bad. So, this monitor cannot be used as a TV with wider view angle. This is expected with VA panels. For work, this is an excellent monitor.3. Gaming looks perfect but not for hard core gaming. It is neither an ultra responsive nor an ultra refresh rate monitor. Such 4k monitors in the market cost 50K+ at the time of this writing. So, it is all about that decent cost-to-performance ratio.4. Speaker default volume is at 30%. It can be increased using the menu, but sound quality is average.Now the most disappointing aspect of the product:1. The power cable provided has a 16A plug! You need to buy a good quality power cable to connect monitor to UPS or the normal 5A wall socket.2. USB type C and display port cables provided in the box. Where is the high speed HDMI cable to connect to PC or laptop that has HDMI out? Normal HDMI cables did not work!3. With APC 1100 UPS connected, the monitor blacks out for a few seconds, every time there is a power cut or restore. But the PC connected to same UPS works fine. Looks like the monitor voltage sensing is super-sensitive.1 star less for making me buy missing accessories. Other than that, this is a good monitor to own."
5,"Was evaluating ultra wide monitor for my Mac. Realised that pixel matters and not the screen dimensions.You get so much of real estate. Also, eliminates adaptor as it can work with USB-C"
4,"The only downside is it comes with a 16amp plug! Why, Benq? Why?This is a great monitor for casual (non competitive) gaming and as a daily driver.This not a dolby vision monitor so do not expect to run Netflix in all its glory. But it is a very capable 32 inch monitor with a bright 4k panel that gets the jobs done.The most comfortable mode (for me) is the Rec. 709 with color calibration from rtings.✌️"
5,"Very good monitor. Different modes show wide verity that the monitor offers. I use Rec709 for work. For video Cinema HD mode is really excellent.Value for money.Provided cables are good, saves about Rs 1000. No USB HUB. No Provision for cable organization."
5,Good value for money. Picture quality is very good. Large size is very good for coding development and general office use. Connected using USB-C to my MBP and it works Without any issues. With default settings the fonts are too small; too small to read- increase the scaling from Display settings of your MacOS and it gets much better. Lot of room for multiple windows. Planning to get one more to make dual monitor setup. Speakers are below average and no USB hub either. It’s disadvantage. BenQ should’ve added atleast two USB ports making it convenient to connect or charge your phones. One other disadvantage: Even if you connect MBP via USB-C MacOS reports the battery is not charging. Overall good monitor for the price.
5,"Buy this monitor if you want good colors. Excellent picture quality.  Very good monitor for photo editing, video editing, cad/cam, watching videos, and gaming.  Response times are good for VA panel.  You will happy.  Just don't use AMA.Esports is also good though I feel 2K high refresh rate monitors are much better for it. You will see everything clearly due to resolution and size.  But this one will beat most 2k monitor in picture quality.  This is definitely not a competitive esports monitor."
3,"I have previously exclusively used IPS panels and tbh the moment I turned on the screen, It was really bad.NOTE: IT comes with a 16Amps plug, I am still at it with customer support for getting a 6Amps plug. Currently using my old monitor plug which works for this too.Everything looks washed out and a bit grainy(which I think is due to the coating being matte and not glossy like most laptop screens). The colors are fairly accurate actually though the uniformity sucks when viewed in front and upclose.I sit at 2 feet away from the screen and the viewing angles are certainly not as advertised. 178/178 lmao, anything above 15/15 degrees looks off-color in all directions which is bothering me a lot. This is not made to be viewed from 2 or even 3 feet.Positives are that the screen looks very good when viewed from afar or when the lights are off it does look better to my ips panels. But this is not a TV and that is not it's primary purpose. I will use it 1-2 days more before trying for a return."
1,I have used my 27 inch ips monitor for the past 8 years. I wanted to upgrade so after seeing so many reviews I ordered it.What a terrible monitor.Colors are completely washed.Back light bleeds on the edges.Eyes were very uncomfortable after a bit of coding.I don't know if it was just this monitor or all va panels but terrible value for this price.I returned it. Can't recommend.
5,"The BenQ monitor is awesome. However, do note that you need to buy a separate hdmi that supports 18Gbps+ speeds for 4k display. Also, if you are using Linux, you will not get 60Hz, which is my case. I think drivers in Linux are responsible for that and not the monitor.Thank you."
4,"I have been using the monitor for 2 months now, and it has not given me any problems. The build quality is good. Sound quality could have been better, but for a monitor that costs only Rs 32,000, this is a minor nitpicking. Overall, great monitor. Go for it."
5,"Using it for my hackintosh setup, and gives u the retina display at 2k resolution. Colours are accurate, brightness is more than enough, HDR is a hit and miss. Fits in well with the wfh setup and being 32"", really does help manage organising windows very well."
5,"The monitor is excellent and delivers performance as expected.The only unconvincing item is the Power Adapter Plug which is BIG. Usually all of computer equipment fits in smaller 5/6AMP plug. AT last minute when you know that you need big 15amp size socket for 5/6amp power plug then you have to arrange it separately.I suggest either to include it, or highlight in product specs so that we can be ready with it in advance."
5,I bought this monitor for my series x and it's awesome thank you benq
5,Awsome monitor. Got what I was expecting. Note that before buying check whether your laptop/desktop supports 4k output. Otherwise it will show only 2k or HD resolution. Dell Inspiron 3521 doesnt support 4k output.
5,"Great Picture quality thin bezel, sturdy stand with multiple ports (2xHDMI, 1x DP, 1x USB-C, headphone socket.The colours are great with good saturation. Probably one of the best 32"" 4K monitor at this price."
5,"The product is really good, since the size it little big it can give you a pain in the neck.Resolution is excellent, but without windows scaling it will be difficult to see the text. But on higher scale its crisp and clear. Not all softwares are scalable, text can be blurry sometimes.For programming I say better go for a 2k resolution antiglare monitor, that should be a best buy coz the text gets real small in this 4k displays.For entertainment this will be perfect buy."
4,"Well this monitor is not meant for gaming. You can still play games with vivid details @4k, but due to low refresh rates, response and fluidity wont be like other gaming monitors.HDR in 4K is just cherry on top.For media consumption this Monitor just hits all the right points."
5,"Hdmi cable Missing .. only 3 cables (power, type C, Display cable)Good all in one entertainment monitor.Able to play in 4k ..cool"
4,Product packaging is goodDelivered on timeBlue eye is Good for office workFinds it good for learning purposeSpeaker is not audible even at close distanceMissing height adjustment is bit minus but not required in most cases as the screen size is bigger.
3,"If you are using a MacBook Pro like me, you would hate this display. The VA panel just can't give you good colours and the viewing angles are very poor. Go for any IPS monitor instead."
5,"probably the best for the price. Because it's not ips panel ,viewing angles are not good but very good contrast ,sharp and clean display, no edge bleed, accurate blacks."
5,"The picture quality is excellent and it's a joy to use a 31 inch 4k screen. Volume is a little low, but a very good monitor, probably better than most others available for the same price"
5,Good picture quality
5,Good
5,Good value for money
5,"Excellent monitor, nice and decent, value for moneyDead pixel - not found in naked eyes :)Thank you BenQ and Amazon both."
5,Breathtaking views and ideal for both gaming and multitasking. Videos come alive with the screen. Though it could improve with colors at an angle.
5,"Good display and great picture quality , and better colour representation"
1,Too big for office work environment
4,"due to COVID - 19 my office instructed to WFH for few weeks and I need an office like setup at home for my busy workday. Bought couple of these monitors and an Amazon Basics dual monitor stand for mounting these monitors. The whole setup compliments my office desk.Pros: - Matty finish (good for programming / development use) - 75Hz refresh rate - LED backlight (night time you can some light bleeding, but during day time / under proper light no difference) - VA Panel (no details about VA / IPS panel either in the documentation or Samsung website) - Colour reproduction is awesome - Mount option available - Frameless Design (looks great)Cons: - No Audio out port (as mentioned by others). You can't use it for other use cases (like tv) - Limited connectivity options (no DVI / DisplayLink port), only HDMI or VGA - VGA resolution is not good when on MAC (I tested Mac Book Pro only, don't know about others). HDMI is recommendedNeed to check the durability."
5,"Got this monitor after going through almost a week of research. Wanted to buy the LG 24"" as the Samsung curved one has a VA panel and I have seen it, the colors were not that great in that one  but at the last moment I saw this from Samsung. My expectations were high from Samsung and it did match my expectations.Pros:1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look.Cons:1. The stand is not adjustable, I didn't expect it to have adjust hight option, but at least adjusting the inclination angle option should be there for an monitor.But it's a great buy at this price point. I got it for 9999. You can go for it. Everything else is really good in this one.Edit: after using it for 6 months, I am impressed with the picture quality and colour reproduction. I didn't face any issues till date. I was so impressed that I got another one to have dual monitor setup :)."
4,This is one of the best displays that I've came across at this price range. The only problem is that you cannot adjust height of the display like most monitors.
4,"CONS (only 2):1.Viewing Angles are NOT OK.Of course it is not an IPS panel. If it's an IPS, there will be a clear logo. There is no mention of the same on official product specs either. It could be a PLS panel.2.Gaming modes: 75 hz. Useless, just marketing. No difference at all. Note: My testing was based on a dedicated graphics card with appropriate settings. Max output was 72 hz. Beyond that, screen will blankout, become non compatible.  However, you will not find any difference compared to 60hz and 75hz. Maybe you will see a difference if you place the panel under a microscope or some highend slow motion camera purely for purpose of panel testing. Its just a marketing myth (irrespective of brands). You can find significant  difference from144hz onwards.PROs:NO BACKLIT BLEEDING across the screen. I tested with a pitch black image file with full brightness settings and various angles in a dark room environment. So no issues at all.Panel is matt finish, so no screen glares to an extent.Color reproduction is very vibrant. Somewhat 70% close to HDR 400 although its not a HDR screen.Overall Build quality, fit and finish is excellent. Very slim bezel with simple modern design and appeal.9.5 K is an excellent price.Package and delivery was good."
5,"Picture quality and viewing angles are awesome, frame less design looks great, but stand is not adjustable and backlight bleeding is there, replaced, and the new one also has bleedingEdit: Returned the second one and purchased again, 3rd monitor has no backlight bleeding"
2,Received Yellow shaded screen and got replaced thanks for that & On Amazon website on Technical Details Origin of country shown as India but on the box its not made in India its some other county.
2,Good monitor but the major issue what I've faced is unable to adjust the up & down height adjustment. Just fixed position.
1,"Neither bad , nor Good . For the price its ok . Color is faded a bit but for 10k . Its ok .Backlight bleeding is there , but very little, can be ignored (I am picky about backlight bleeding) . I came form a TN panel, so color is obviously better but the punchyness strains the eye a lot .Overall a nice monitor to go for . Didnt give 5 star as previously I saw a dell monitor (forgot the name) about 5 years back . That had better color but 7 ms response time which was bad .Imp : dont go for 1080p in 27 inch monitor if you are looking for new purchase. You will see pixel . 1080p is best till 24 inch .Update : got a dead pixle today . Thank God within return period . Dont know how long this will last ."
1,"After reading blinding issue review. I trusted Samsung and it was my mistake. I have two monitors one is Samsung and other is Dell, but to be very Frank the samsung has worst quality. I don't know is it specific to model only. I request you do not buy this product."
3,"The product is having major backlight bleeding.The first unit I got had little backlight at the bottom and I replaced it, and the second one I got had bleeding from all directions. it was just worst."
5,"I have been using this monitor for a week now, primarily for work and a little bit of gaming, and I am quite impressed by what it offers for the price (I got it for 8500 during prime day).Pros:1. Deep blacks give great contrast ratio2. Matt finish minimizes reflections3. Freesync and 75hz are good additions for gaming4. Very slim bezels on 3 sidesCons:1. No vertical height adjustment2. Color accuracy could be better out of the box. It is apparent in the pic where you can see the difference in green color of the leaves on the laptop screen and the monitor. But since i am not doing any color sensitive work, I found it acceptable."
1,Old model (LCD Technology) and New model (LED Technology) is the exact same price.I ordered the newer model of the monitor and received an older model. Within 1 hr asked the Customer service team  No: 1to change my monitor they couldn't help they openly said they can't do any changes to my order and cannot do refund or exchanges.They are playing with words that mentions 7 day replacement but that's puts where there is other wordings like warranty so people mistake themTeam 2 of customer service came on the phone and they said they can help and guess what they ordered a replacement of the same model and serial number. That's not the way Customer service work. Why would I need the same model and serial number replaced again when I have the same thing in my home delivered about 1 hr ago.3rd Team said they cannot order the newer model and cannot do a exchange and cannot do a refund of the money as well.So basically I should keep what I ordered and paid.I shouldn't have bought it in Amazon to be honest just useless team and if they can't help the client who has paid 10K for a monitor they should be bothered about clients going to other E platform sites.
5,I think this is not a IPS display as there is no mention of IPS on the box nor in the manual and description.After a Little bit of research i came to know that Samsung has its own version of IPS technology and it is called PLS technology which is very similar to IPS hence i got very similar image quality.Overall inshort:Pros:1) Punchy Colors.2) Contrasty image (some may not like).3) Wide Viewing angle.4) 75 Hz refresh rate (72Hz freesync on).5) No Backlight Bleeding.6) Really thin bezel for price.7) One Joystick botton to control all features.8) Cable hook provided in box for cable management.9) Quite good design.10) Blacks are quite good not best. Cons :1) It is little bit pixelating kinda okayish as its 24 inch but higher than 24inch it might get worse.2) No height adjustment only tilt feature.3) I think its not as colour accurate as IPS because image looks quite punchy maybe you have to adjust setting for accuracy.4) No one tap button Power off as its a two step process.5) No onscreen software control available.6) No audio out from display.7) Stand is glossy and matte plastic combo which is okayish.8) Only HDMI and Sub DVI no Display port.By the way it can be overclocked to 83Hz max and HDMI cable is provided in box.Overall good Monitor for its price as i bought it at ₹9500.
1,"12-05-2021 - Amazon delivered the monitor in one day but received defective product, upon complaint amazon expert verified the issue and initiated replacement immediately.13-05-2021 - received replacement. Problem with this is it's not at all monitor for daily work. Even with '0' brightness i can't read a word doc for more than 5 mins. Definitely some issue with brightness. Note: i am on 75Hz. Requesting for return and Amazon acknowledged that. Thanks to AmazonIssues -No sharpness(looks like CRT monitor)improper RGB balanceThe LCD panel also having some issue as able to some overlighting patches in the bottom."
5,"Pros.1. Samsung screens doesn't need a intro. Even other mobile manufacturer's are buying screens from samsung only. So screen quality is top notch😍.2. It is a IPS panel, viewing angles good. Inky black. Good contrast. Great brightness. No backlight issue most important to choose this.3. Comes with hdmi cable and power cable. No VGA anyhow I don't need that, but if you need you have to buy it separately.4. Installation is easy and wall mountable. Planning to make it as a second tv after WFH over 😝Cons.Price again it is not a cons. Would have been great if it is little cheaper.Overall great purchase and good Monitor"
5,"This display is classic Samsung. Contrast-y, bright and sharp. The actually frequency is 72.9 Hz whereas advertised as 75 Hz.The picture modes are good and offers a dedicated Game Mode - where all the sliders are maxed out.The FreeSync is a boon, it improves the ghosting observed and minimizes any screen-tearing.The fixture is robust and looks sleep, except there is a slight screen wobble when I types at my max speed.The cable management behind is good and the included HDMI cable is a welcome.The bezels are stunning and movies/games look seamless.I like the display, 9/10."
5,"Good monitors,  I bought 2 monitors for a better dual screen experience.  Although this is basil less, the black edging is significantly lower compared to the other monitors I've used at work.The backlight bleeding is very less  , Infact it's the best of what I've seen so far. (photo attached has reflection)The viewing angles are great. I do not see much difference in color when looked at the display from the sides.The monitor automatically selects input devices. Can be controlled in the setting menuOver all, for 9k -10k this is a good  monitor for the price rangeDownside: no dvi"
4,"I have been using a 27"" LG 4K IPS primary monitor that costs 40K+ and a cheap 20"" Samsung TN secondary monitor. The secondary monitor has been showing some signs of old age, and needed a replacement. What I wanted was an affordable monitor that had reasonable picture quality and over all build quality.To be honest, I only expected an average performer in this monitor, and was pleasantly surprised by it's image quality. The colours are vibrant (don't expect the quality you get from a premium monitor) and it has more than enough brightness.My premium primary monitor, while having excellent colour reproduction and pixel density suffers from shoddy quality control -  I had to replace it five times in the span of 18 months due to various issues ranging from terrible backlight bleeding, colour non-uniformity and image retention. So when bought this rather cheap Samsung monitor, my expectations were not that high. But it outperformed my expectations. For the asking price, this is a steal.The good:1. Adequate image quality and colour reproduction. Bear in mind that it is not factory calibrated.2. Excellent blacks - Even though Samsung says it is an IPS panel, I suspect that it is indeed a VA panel, because I have never seen an IPS panel that is able to render such deep blacks as this monitor does.3. Really good brightness4. Relatively lightweight5. Almost no bezels6. Adequate viewing angles7. The VESA mount bracket is on level with the surface, unlike some LG monitors where the VESA screws area is depressed which would make it incompatible with some VESA mounts.-----* The pros listed below this point are specific to my monitor, and may not hold true for every one as these things are dependent on QC and is based on your luck.6. Only extremely minor backlight bleeding - so minor that you'd often fail to notice it. My 40k+ LG monitor has major backlight bleeding issues. So this is a major relief for me.7. No image retention issues8. Excellent Black and White uniformity. Grey uniformity is only average.Cons:1. The included stand is of low quality. It has sharp rough edges and mold marks.2. Tilt is very difficult to execute. You have to apply a lot of force to tilt the monitor, sometimes I felt worried that I might damage the monitor.3. Not so great pixel density. Being only a 1080p monitor, 24"" size makes the pixels too big which force you to stay a bit farther away, otherwise the text does not look smooth. This is not a problem for watching videos or playing games.------* Following cons are specific to the monitor I received and other devices may not have these issues4. Dead pixels - Mine had 5 dead pixels which were prominently around the top right corner. I wasn't bothered by those though.NOTE:When I first turned on the monitor I experienced some contrast related issues. The monitor was unable to render certain shades of grey and looked indistinguishable from white. It turned out that this was caused by the setting 'Black level' - mine had it set to 'Low', and once I changed it to 'Normal' the issue was gone."
1,"I  ordered this product on 16th of this month, I was waiting to for this very eagerly. Finally i received it today and installed, Initially i played few HD videos i liked the picture quality. Later I wanted to do my office work so i connected my laptop and then i got resolution issue i tried to resolve it but i couldn't. When i read the documents (work related word files) i found there is  another issue like sharpness, i was not able to concentrate while reading.  I tried to resolve the issue but i couldn't. And i finally decided to return this product, so i contacted amazon technical team, but i am not happy with their suggestions, they are asking me to use one more week, when i have made up my mind to return this product. I spoke to three people and everybody suggested the same. It was just a waste of my time and energy,  because they were not giving exact solution.I am very disappointed."
5,"I’d say this is a great monitor, I use it for gaming with my Nintendo switch and use it for editing photos and videos for my YouTube channel, which I have a video review on at Parikv99. Picture quality is really good and build is superb as well. Only things missing are an audio out port, but that doesn’t bother me much since I use my headphones anyway and height adjust. Great, value for money monitor that I recommend if this is your budget."
5,"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.Need a little tweak to make this really great.When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution."
5,"This is a gorgeous monitor on this range, I bought it for my office use. It was easy to setup.Picture quality is difficult to say, my laptop shows sky blue color but monitor shows in turquoise color. Tried all the settings, not sure there's a color problem with my hp laptop or Samsung monitor.There's no adjustable stand but can be wall mounted - the way I wanted."
5,Great product! Got it at Rs.9499 without any offers. Package arrived in 1 day. Eco friendly packing. Monitor has eye saver mide which is great and brightness can be increased or reduced as per comfort. Looks nice of the while and display is problem free.I didnt see any noticable light leakage in the screen edges as some posts say. Probably its miniscule.
3,I bought this samsung S24R356FHWXXL 24 inch monitor and Its build Quality was nice. But one problem I found was its color was not accurate and giving bluish green shade. so It affects my designing work and I requested return. So as per their policy they replaced it with another monitor same model. But the problem was still there. so again returned and I gone for Benq monitor. It gave me very good color accuracy and satisfied with the result :)
4,"Rcvd the product very fast.Negative Things:1. Screen Is fixed type you cant not adjust it horizontal or vertical.2. While connecting with laptop as second screen refresh rate gets only 71.90HZ, contacted customer care, reply rcvd as extending the display across your screen and tv then you will of course experience a bit of a decrease in performance.Only the good thing got it in 8500rs in amazon sale."
4,"Bought it as my second monitor.Big enough for normal office works. Have played FPS games and the experience is decent.Steal at 9000/-I don't know why it is listed at 13,000 right now. Don't buy it at this price. There are better options out there at this inflated price point."
5,"Excellent product. Though I am little sceptical whether it is IPS or not. Good colors, really bright for indoor, anti-glare. You will enjoy viewing it. My unit has a tiny black dot on the right side, I believe a foreign particle in between the layer. But I dont mind it. It does not have back light bleeding. Right side portion is little brighter than the left side if you are viewing black. Tilt mechanism is little weird. Otherwise really good product."
3,"Text from far looks good but if you are using it upclose this won't cut it. I have a macbook pro, i think i might be spoiled by those crips display. It's not atall a bad panel but for my use case i might save up to buy a 2k or 4k panel, 1080p ain't cutting it."
5,Good product. No backlight bleeding issue. If you need a good quality monitor go for it. You'll not be disappointment.
4,"So, my first attempt of buying this product was not good. The monitor had screen bleeding after few hours of use itself. Returned and got a replacement.Pros:Love the look, design and curve around the edgesNo screen bleeding with the replaced monitorDisplay is goodOverall happy with the price point and product.Cons:Stand is not adjustableThe button is on the backside which was difficult to find at first and not so great to useBrightness level is too much even if I decrease it to a minimum, but I have got used to it now after few days.Overall, worth to buy especially for the price compared to the competition"
5,"I am Software Engg by profession was always thriving to get a bigger screen monitor, now is perfect time to maximum the useage of this perfect product from Samsung during this WFH culture.Samsung always know for their product durability, monitor looks sturdy, good build quality, good picture quality as well. You cannot tilt or adjust monitor that’s the only where felt the disappointment which not of a major deal breaker."
1,"Ordered a unit on 3rd April, received with multiple dead pixels on it. I was not sure about the dead pixel policy but worrying that it may get worse in the future I opted for a replacement. Oh my was I in for a surprise, the replacement unit had a physical defect along with a dead pixel. Returned the 2nd unit as well, and took a refund due to ""Only one replacement policy"". Both units had Sept'20 as MFG date. Samsung needs to improve its QC or Amazon delivery guys need to handle the package with care."
1,Very poor build..Ants entered inside the display within 1month..can't believe it.. very very very cheap materials used..cheap thin plastic around the display is very fragile and loose!! Is this really from samsung??!!! Or fake one?
1,Bright area at bottom edge of the monitor
3,"I thought I'd use it as a secondary, vertical monitor beside my primary 27"" WQHD IPS. I couldn't stand it.The panel is not that great, very little headroom to tweak it to display accurate colors. Cannot even set gamma manually, just some presets. Then, the PPI is also low enough to look unpleasant. Samsung claims it's an IPS, but I suppose it barely makes the cut.Find something better for your money."
5,"After checking all monitors from HP and LG in this price range, finally decided to go with this model. Major reason was the price as I got this 24 inch mod for only 8.5k during prime day sale!!!I will divide the review between pros and cons-Pros:1. Cheapest 24 inch full HD IPS monitor from a premium brand2. Picture quality is excellent, viewing angles are great as it has IPS panel3. Bezels are almost non existent which gives a premium look4. Setup is easy, hdmi cable is provided instead of vga which is a plus for using with most modern devices5. Only one button operation For controlling brightness and contrast etc.6. Cables can be arranged with the provided clip7. No weird backlight bleeding8. Wall mounting is possibleCons:1. Stand takes little extra space due to the design of it2. Minimum brightness could have been lower3. Tilting range is limitedIf you’re deciding between this one and LG, you can go with either one as both are almost same."
3,"Its is really a good monitor in the price Range, but cant adjust the height or neither can be tilted.Picture quality is really amazing.The monitor I got had too much IPS glow from bottom (clearly seen in night) and had few dead pixels. so, I had to return it.Sometimes my eyes were hurting on watching this monitor, although brightness, contract was at the minimum level.For Dual WFH home setup, yes its good, make sure that the monitor is placed 3 feed approx from your sitting place to get a decent view and not hurt your eyes.Rating  -Monitor Build - 7/10Picture - 8/10Gaming - 8/10WFH - 7/10"
5,"I was really worried during the shipment of this product. Appario are great sellers and I always trust their listings, but 5-6 days for just dispatching??Ummm... is it because I got it way cheaper than the price listed?But the product arrived safely and it works amazing (lucky me). The display is really crisp n clear and the details are great! Compared to a VGA 18 inch monitor,  I can really see n feel the difference.Although you can't change the monitor height, the default tilt is pretty good (screen is large enough that you probably won't need to change anything).My take - definitely go for it (if u get it under 10K)"
5,Why is it blue in colour?? Is it damaged. I just got the product now
4,This is a great monitor. I switched from 19.5 and this feels huge compared to that. The picture quality is very good and watching videos is an absolute delight. It also has a vesa mount for hooking it on stands or wall. Its not really thin compared to some of hp monitors at that price but it feels sturdy. But the stand takes quite a lot of space and is spread out and its overall a bit heavy
1,"Product discription is missleading. Its not a LED monitor. clear a cheap quality LCD. piture quality is too poor. Veiwing angle is not good as its cheap LCD. Seller / Amazon kept the item discription smartly to misslead the customers. They make the policy hard to contact them. Unable to detacjlt HDMI port. Not able to use as extended display.Instead of take a quick action they inveatigate the issue they are misleading the customer. Should mention clear product discrpition. product is not worth more the  2k, years back technology. smartly kept mrp and give discount to people. After they make the policy such that you have to take hell lot to contact them and return for refund. This is totally misleading the indian consumers who may not know much about the product technical details."
1,Please do not order this product as it is an LCD not an LED. I had a talk with the customer service team also and they asked me to return this product. This review I am putting just to make you aware that DO Not Buy this product as the description is misleading.
5,"I am giving my review after 1 year of use.Pros:-1. superb picture quality2. Wide screen which feels premium one3. Affordable at this price range ( I bought this for ₹5,000 during offer period )4. Comes with HDMI port5. Blue light filter6. Wall mountableCons :-1. Poor Viewing angle not suitable for people who searching for an TV like Monitor. But if you want are in search for productivity. It's the best.2. Little bit cheaper because of plastic build.3. I think this pc is not suitable for office works because the back side of the monitor is worst you can go for DellBut if you are a student and searching for only productive work monitor. I swore this is the best one.Thanks for reading 🤠🤠🤠"
1,"Worst monitor that I have seen in my life and when I say this I mean I have used non branded chinese monitors, cheap monitors from Indian brands such as Zebronics, Intex, Micromax, etc..Viewing angles are so bad that I had to sit infront in center of the monitor to get any work done, I wasnt able to see anything from sides or it was blurred if I moved to the sides, I wasnt able to see anything atall from the top.Built quality it so bad if you sqeez the bottom plastic bezel ripples are seen on whole screen. Also monitor is so light weight and imbalanced that even a little touch can make the monitor tumble and fall.Overall very bad experience with Aopen. If you are planing to go for a cheap monitor save your money and go for Zebronics or even Dell.Also Amazon has only replacement policy for monitors you cannot return this monitor for a refund."
1,"Don't buy this product, picture clarity is poor.can't find the acer brand name anywhere!!!very cheap quality... display contrast and britness is higher and no option to reduce the screen light.This product shown in description as eye protection shield is in it,but while using this monitor my eyes are straining so much because of law clarity,high brightness and contrast.Already tryed to control the screen brightness and contrast through the system settings but clarity reduces very badly....!!!!👎👎👎👎 all-over wasting time and money.. that's it..."
4,"I purchased this as a second monitor but to my surprise, I am using it more than my Acer 222hq. The monitor has a mat finish screen and so working on it in brightly lighted atmosphere is not a problem. I have not used it as gaming monitor. But, watching fhd movies/ Videos/ images are pleasant experience.However, the built quality is not up to the mark and the monitor panel gets hot after some time ( just like mobile phones). Don't exactly know how long it will be o.k. But, there are 3 years warranty from Acer. Let's see.One thing I mention, if you want to do your daily office job from home, with a monitor with economic pricing, this one is the bestI am doing my daily office job for almost 8 hours with it and no eye straining."
4,"Review for 22CH1Q 21.5-inchHeard Aopen for the 1st time and as it was associated with Acer went ahead with its purchase even though I went through some very bad reviews on Amazon. Not sure if people actually meant what they said but there was actually some wrong things mentioned by people in review, eg. HDMI port not available, but in actual its with HDMI port. One thing which hold true from reviews is that the viewing angles are not good and you see white at the bottom of the monitor screen while working on it.1) Its 21.5 inches2) HDMI & VGA ports. No USG or any other sort of port3) No speakers4) Display is too bright and need to be adjusted to very low brightness and contrast5) White display at bottom while working on the monitor6) Sleek and thinOverall at the deal price on Amazon, its worth for basic use. If you want to use for gaming and other heavy stuff, this is not the monitor and you need to invest a lot more and buy a higher end monitor."
1,Video Player is loading.
5,"Very good color reproduction, full HD 60hz display, supports both vga and hdmi connections, no audio input ports, comes with only vga cable in the box. Lots of customization features in the built in menu which I have not tried yet. 3 yrs warranty by Acer backed support centers. I got this for only 4K during amazon sale so very happy with this purchase as I mainly use it as external display for my office work and sometimes watching movies. Combined with wireless keyboard and mouse it makes a very nice home office setup!Note : I had to order replacement on first monitor due to vga cable connector issue and the seller promptly issue a replacement monitor which was delivered the next day."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Good display for the price i got it in deal at 3800 with sbi credit card.Full hd 1920x1080p resolution.5ms response.60 hz can be overclocked.Flickerless technology.Tiltable and wall mount.Hdmi and vga.Only viewing angles are bad.But no complains at this price point.If you re on tight budget then buy it in sale dont buy in normal days.There are 80% negative reviews the reason is that they paid high amount like 6k 6.k in the past.But i got it in 3800 rs for me its great coz i dont have high budget.My main work is college work and some gaming purpose for me its ok ok monitor.
1,"While the price was attractive, very poor quality. The circular base-support on the inside has a horse-shoe-type mould which was so poorly designed that it wouldnt sit properly even on the flattest of surfaces.I decided to return the product, for want of a better quality, but couldnt do so as there was only option to ask for a replacement and not return (not sure if this is an amazon problem (or) Acer's policy). I was forced to order for a replacement. However i then found an option to return the order via the new replacement order screen.If you are looking for some quality for the money you are paying dont go for this."
5,"Don't expect much from it. It's just a part of your budget PC. For me it's a value for money product. Don't confuse, its a LCD monitor with LED backlight only. It comes with one power adaptor, one VGA cable, HDMI port is given but cable is not provided. No audio port available. Hope you find this review helpful."
4,"Positive - the monitor was delivered very next day. It is pretty light and the screen look sharp as well. I think it is a decent monitor in this price.Not so positive - The screen can be tilted only few inches backwards which i find bit annoying. Wish it cold be more flexible. Also, the screen color selection is limited as well. Recommended from my side."
5,"It's a product that is simple, smart and does the job.Pros:1) Has Hdmi and Vga port both.2) 22 inches is apt screen size.3) Supports screen extension, you can have two screens.4) keys are behind the TV screen, so you get full viewing experience5) it is extremely sleek and viewing angles are good.Cons:1) I couldn""t find any. It is a monitor guys, stop being too critical about it.I got is for 4200 inr"
5,"excellent monitor and I just paid ~Rs.4800 after discounts. very thin and light weight, its really bright that its nice to enable the bluesheild to reduce the blueness thats harsh on the eyes. it has multiple modes like internet, sports, cinema, game, text etc. it feels like a TV. resolution is crisp and nice. Recommended purchase."
5,Very good monitor at this price. Acer provides good quality monitors at low price. Its LCD monitor and only backlight is LED. This is clearly mentioned at backside of monitor. Viewing angle has issues but i am comfortable as most of time i am looking straight at monitor.
5,I purchased on big million day 4700 Rs 21.5 inch with card offers. Really great deal. Really worth. Use for office work. Very lite weight less the 1 kg. Simply the best. No speaker. HDMI and vga port available. Only vga cable inside box. Power adapter very small like mobile charger no ground and length around 1 - 1.5 metres. Color production is good for this price range. Simply buy it if u want less price with reasonable monitor. Worth for money. For office work it's more than enough. Belazles bit thicker compare to ips monitor. YouTube FullHD videos very awesome. Viewing angle reasonable. Don't spend money for electronic. Good to go.
1,"Acer please stop making pathetic products like this. Don't get me wrong, Acer's other monitors are top class like Nitro series and predator but particular low budget product is not good not even worth 1 k and your charging 4k . Poor quality picture colors, bleeding white light , excessive backlight which cannot be fixed by the horrible old fashioned menu it has.the circuit design itself is faulty gives out unnecessary lights. Stop making AOPEN."
1,Monitor is surely not worth the 4500/- price tag let alone the MRP which is optimistic at 7900/-. Received an open box with 2mm crack in LCD panel inside in the display. Cannot be bothered to return as use is in office for employees so will ignore.
3,Product discription is missleading. Its not a LED monitor. clear a cheap quality LCD. piture quality is too poor. Veiwing angle is not good as its cheap LCD. Seller / Amazon kept the item discription smartly to misslead the customers. They make the policy hard to contact them. Unable to detacjlt HDMI port. Not able to use as extended display.
3,"Feature wise one issue: the power chord is proprietary 5v power brick rather than usual monitor power Chord,And the viewing angles are very bad, not specifically for this monitor but for all tn pannel monitor in general.When seen from an angle more than 40°, the colour seems to be inverted. Even when viewing from close distance , you can see the colour difference in center of montior and top due to angle difference in viewingFor using as Monitor it will serve the purpose but for media and video, when you want to sit back and enjoy from a distance , this won't work fine"
3,"The product is OK for this amount, but the picture quality is good only in a straight view. If you little tilt the monitor up or down the picture look like a photo negative. And also note it's not a full HD resolution monitor. My opinion is if you have a budget below 5k then you will go for this monitor. otherwise please don't choose it."
2,"It is Aopen and nowhere you will find Acer. If you are looking for a monitor to use as a cctv or something like, then go for it; but if it is for daily usage, not at all good... Excess of brightness, issue with colour, low picture quality, you can make the difference in few minutes, if you have experience with other monitors. Tried all possibilities to adjust contrast and brightness, no way acceptable, returning the product.Edit : Monitor replaced, most of the issues linked to picture quality disappeared, but still the perfection is not there in color. Green appears as pale green, so as orange n red.Also need to adjust our chair as monitor cannot be tilted, a slight change in position makes the vision uncomfortable."
4,"Seems good. Btw where is the serial number of the monitor mentioned?  I find only a blank space against the column, serial number I'm the label.fixed at the back of the.monitor.. is the long 25 digit number I find above the barcode in the label, the serial number? The 7-dogt number I found in Amazon's.invoice is said to.be incorrect when I filled it up for the end-user for the 3 year warranty"
5,"The monitor is thin and lightweight.Power supply is not a direct AC power cord instead, it has a DC power adapter hence the monitor is thin and lightweight.Power buttons and menu controls are located at the back of the monitor and might be inconvenient for some.Has both HDMI and VGA ports."
1,"Had dead pixel when I opened it. The build quality is poor. The plastic bezels were not solid and were flexible with gaps visible.Only good thing is that the bezels are thin. Its light weight, maybe why it's build quality is bad.I would recommend you to get the Acer FHD monitor which costs around 6k."
1,I bought the monitor as an extended screen for my laptop for WFH arrangement. But the display of the monitor is very poor. Excel sheets are not visible properly and are flickering which causes very painful for eyes.Its only apt only for CCTV monitor in your societies nothing else.Moreover amazon only has replacement for this product no return policy.
5,Just to clear this is lcd monitor with led backlit.Pretty decent monitor. I use it as second screen while coding and it serves the purpose well.We might have to set the brightness manually everytime but that is okay for the price point.
1,Dead pixel problem. Text getting blurred. No uniformity in color distribution. Upper half the screen has raddish tint. Lower Half is brighter. Don't go for this model. Viewing angle is bad for the people who use spectacles. Not good for long use
2,"I hope it is full-Hd but only hd with low picture quality,There is small lining in the screen which proof duplicate product.fake product and fake review. i had this product .Please Don't buy it for good reason i m telling you.if u want to buy go for another company like Dell,Aoc,Benq so remember Acer/Aopen is a worst product."
5,"Picture quality is good.Blue light mode is present along with eco,game mode.Can use it for long hours(not recommending).View angle is good.At first time of use brightness will high reduce it using menu option.Worth for its price."
5,"Review after using at least for 1 month, --it is amazing monitor for this prize, it's working perfectly. I always love Amazon ,they make sure that a proper and  perfect product arrives to us which we have ordered, I have always got good product's from them, don't go with bad reviews just believe in amazon."
5,"Decent monitor for the price range. Actually the first monitor had a pixel issue, but got a replacement monitor which works perfect.. Brightness level is good, has a slim construction and also, love the anti- glare coating. Don't listen to other reviews saying this is an LCD monitor. LED monitors are basically LCD with LED blacklight..."
1,"This is an LCD monitor imported by ACER. It's typical of cheap imported screens. It's too bright with no real control over brightness or contrast. It has a lot of ""funda"" features which serve no real purpose. It's not a LED monitor, it's an LCD. You're better off paying 1000 more for one of the more reliable brands on this same platform. I returned mine!"
3,Initial impressionsA Gud Product at this price pointA Clear MonitorPerfect suit for my Home OfficeA Great alternate to my LG monitorFor those who are screaming that its not a LEDKindly read the description clearly its LED backlit not an LED monitor they had mentioned it as an LED backlit not an LED monitor its an Decent LCD with LED backlitThose who don't even know what it is kindly google it before reading some reviewsKudos for those who cry for misunderstanding their description and Saying it as a worst productIts a Pretty decent product though would update a Review after long usage
1,I have purchased this 21.5 inch one month ago at 5299 prices and today they raised it to 6499.The display quality was very pathetic and found some dead pixels.The blacks look like grayish. for no reason in every monitor I have seen a pale shadow around the borders.I'd suggest going to branded ones.
1,"Not good for photoshopOnly good for ms officueWorst monitor that I have seen in my life and when I say this I mean I have used non branded chinese monitors, cheap monitors from Indian brands such as Zebronics, Intex, Micromax, etc..Viewing angles are so bad that I had to sit infront in center of the monitor to get any work done, I wasnt able to see anything from sides or it was blurred if I moved to the sides, I wasnt able to see anything atall from the top."
2,First time when it's start with in the second I realize that I have made a big mistake by selecting it. Can't work on it. Good to switch to Laptop screen. Very poor picture quality as TN Panel used also viewing angel very poor. In summary don't buy this item.
1,"I purchased this product to use as a monitor for my laptop during working. When I connect the VGA cable to the laptop, I feel an earthing sensation in the laptop. When I remove the cable everything is alright. I had connected many other monitors to my laptop and I am facing this issue only with this monitor.I tried to replace the monitor and get a a new one. The result is same. Now I want to return the monitor and get the money refunded. But the option is not available.Amazon should not sell such sub-standard products"
5,I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)If you're a gamer do not go with this one.Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.Thanks for reading.Don't forget to check out the channel :)
5,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning dealFollowing are my observations:1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.Monitor has following ports:D-SubHDMI PortDisplay PortLine-in port and3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphonesThis monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!"
5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.Pros:- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.Cons:- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.Let me know if you need to know more."
4,"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure."
3,"The monitor is well built.  Quality is also good.  However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff.  The fonts will look blurred.  It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution.  24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes.  If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones.  Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!"
5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24” inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn’t even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.I found the feature “Low blue light” and “Brightness intelligence technology” - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to “Low blue light emission”.In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can’t say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen."
5,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )Pros:1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's  from dell.2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that4. Brightness is way too much high5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)Cons1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you."
1,"BenQ ships this monitor with a LARGE 16A power plus which needs an AEH point. In India, such power outlets are only provided for Refrigerators, Owens, Geysers and similar electrical equipments that need high Amperes. A monitor does not need 16A. Why is BenQ shipping it with an unusually big power socket forcing customers to buy additional converters? Can BenQ or Amazon answer this question?"
5,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are  buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbageI gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through."
5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)2. Contrast: 603. Sharpness: 54. Gamma: 55. Color Temperature: Normal6: Hue: 507. Saturation: 50Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start,  you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels)."
5,"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing .."
5,"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.My overall experience with this monitor is amazing."

1,"I purchase this monitor on Oct 21,2020, I could not able to switch on the monitor due to  3 pin power cord(cable) is not able to insert any of my switch box or extension board which is big and not fitting and I contacted the Amazon customer care they said better to buy a power cable or plug separately which is really not expected from the Benq and I felt 16A cable unnecessary here, please consider this point while buying this monitor."
1,After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.
1,"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help."
1,"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it.  After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time.  In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours!  I returned it after four days of wasted effort.  May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415.  The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same.  Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain!  The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!Can't comment on gaming capabilities."
1,"I brought this product thinking the best and I made a great mistake, I picked this over DELL that I repent till now. The first 10 days the product was good after that spotted a small line in the middle of the screen. I have registered a complaint with the team REF: R200301312 and no one bothered to reach me till now. Escalation number 9560055022 was also not reachable. If you want to spend your hard-earned money put in a well-reputed brand."
4,Pros:1. Tiny bezels2. Great colour composition3. Good collection of input options4. Vesa mount compatible5. Pocket friendlyCons:1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight3. Menu control system UI is very bad
1,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I’ll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.Coming to monitor:1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.2) It claims it is an IPS display but it’s just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you’re sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.4) And about speakers I’m still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.I don’t know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I’m starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it’s ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it’s the product itself. Anyways I’m not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.Either ways I’m returning it never to buy this product again. I’ll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products."
3,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,The ports, there should have been at least one display port.Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.I am disappointed.Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display."
1,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me"
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.Pros-1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.Cons-1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2× HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?JUST GO FOR IT."
1,"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.Poor aftersales support."
1,"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor  became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about."
4,"I know you guys must be wondering why my review title says ""Dont buy"" but I have given 4 star rating to this product. It's because this product comes with a 16A 150V power adapter. In usual cases we do not have 16A power output available to work with monitors. So please make sure you have 16A 250V plug point available. I had to purchase separate power cord to work with this monitor. Also, in the description it was not mentioned that it requires higher volt output plug which was a conflict because the product was not returnable only exchangeable."
5,"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD"
4,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.The good -- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.- The viewing angles are excellent.- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.The bad -- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!"
4,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ₹17,500, a good ₹3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.EDIT: Please ignore the following paragraph. Turns out I am wrong. But it doesn't affect my final rating for the product.

Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more."
5,"First Things First:You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/Replacement under warranty:My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.Coming to the monitor:My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia."
1,"I ordered the item on 24th June and got delivery on Delivered 30-Jun-2020. Amazon Packing was excellent to avoid any damage to the item. I started using it on 6th July. On 12th day; Friday 17th of July, there was a flicker on the screen which was hardly noticed. On Sunday 19th July afternoon there appeared vertical lines covering 3/4 of the screen from bottom.  Reached Amazon to check what next; as 16 days replacement period after delivery date expired, I was advised to contact BenQ customer service. Sunday being a holiday for BenQ customer care; I opened a complaint with BenQ customer care, hoping to get a resolution.Manufacturing date of the product is April 2020 and product having 39 month warranty from manufacturing date or invoice date which ever is earlier is the only hope to get this one working again. Fingers crossed. I'm not giving any rating as of now; as it is too early to comment either pros and cons of the product. Will write a feedback after the product is fixed and continued usage for a month or so.&&&&&&&&&&&&& experience after monitor replacement.&&&&&&&&&&Replacement item received on 18th August. Using the item till then for 5 days a week almost 9 to 10 hours. It’s time to rate this product... it’s a great product and happy with the purchase. No issues with the replacement item at all. Overall I recommend this product if you are looking for a good monitor for daily use."
4,"I have purchased this item from Amazon, I have paid Rs.7890/-Pros:1. Design which will attract you first.2. Eye protection display3. Sensor to adjust brightness4. Dual HDMI5. It comes with a small speaker (Don't expect a good one, but within budget this is a good thing)6. Audio Jack if you needed.7. 3 Years warranty8. Cable management deckCons:1. Brightness is saturating when you watch netflix or youtube.2. No HDMI inside package, instead you will received old VGA cable.So basically it is perfect for budget.## If you are a Macbook user and want to use it as external display then go for it.Tested:1. MacBook Air 2015 (Os Catalina) - Working with (Amazon Basics Mini DP cable and Bluerigger)2. MacBook Air 2017 (High Sierra) - Working with ( same above )"
5,"""A Normal (Not a Gamer or an Editor) User's Perspective""✅Design : Almost Bezel-less seems Attractive.✅Panel Quality : Excellent (No bleeding and nice Blacks for an IPS).✅Picture Quality : Excellent Colors (Can be tweaked up or tweaked down using Control buttons according to the preferences).✅Connectivity : HDMI (In the box) and VGA.✅Audio : Speaker is not worth it but 3.5mm Audio Jack is useful.✅Other Features : Brightness, EyeCare Sensor (Some might find it useful)✅Assembling : Fitting the Stand is a Two-Step process (Just follow the Manual) also Wall mounting is possible it seems.✅Mfg Date : March 2020.✅Seller : Appario Retail Private Ltd (Safe Packaging and Quick Delivery)✅Conclusion : At ₹9490, it is ""THE BEST"" surpassing other so-called Tier-1 Brands atleast in terms of Features."
3,"It’s a great product for the price but terrible service in Chennai. The monitor I received has one display port and one HDMI and the display port isn’t working. So I called BenQ customer care and was put in touch with the local service provider. But the local service provider refused to even come take a look at the product and tried to resolve all my queries through phone/WhatsApp! He gave me all the most obvious solutions that any person with electronics knowledge would try before calling customer care—maybe he assumed because I’m a woman, I don’t know even basic things about cables and cable quality. Even after I tried to explain that I’ve tried everything he was suggesting, his only advice was to buy more expensive cables. Very annoying and ultimately futile."
4,Good product...Best affordable 24inch monitor at this price range. Grabbed it for 8800! The 75hz works fine. The stand is not upto the mark and adjustable but can't complain as the price is reasonable.So overall a must grab 24inch monitor for 9k range
1,"Unboxing my monitor, I felt very happy to see it.but as soon as I connected it to power and switched on, I was shocked to see the lines on the screen Packing is not good. Immediately I called Amazon technician.. he told me not to worry. but the return process will start after the servers will get speed up. Next day again I called customer care, then that lady told me  your return process will start two days later..then a boy came to collect monitor and insisted to verify the product and suggested me to call customer care once again.. and why I  had  not returned the product with in a hour as if I know his address"
5,"Review after 1 week of usage.I bought it for work purposes as an extension to my working laptop. For 7.2k, this is worth it. Sometimes watch youtube videos and clarity is pretty awesome.I would recommend you to go for it. If I am not updating this review that means it's still running fine."
5,"This has vesa mounting point which i was looking for and the weight is not that high so it can be acccomodated easily, the picture quality is good enough for home office like solution."
5,Excellent clarity
5,"good build quality and have better picture quality then lg 430 model, no screen bleeding, uniform colors spread, only issue i felt is little poor viewing angle lg 430 has better and seller did really good packing, box arrived intact with company logo written on sealed tape"
5,I am using this as an extended screen to my laptop and it's worth it.
4,I like this product and I use in cctv monitors
5,Pretty decent monitor. Came with HDMI cabl but no VGA cable included. Have to buy seperately. But truly recommend.

1,Broken
4,Little bit heating. Overall good product. Working well without any problem. Value of money. It is Good for long use.
5,Being a gamer...i needed a monitor and this came in..i took it...so here is a small review. The monitor is nice. Its good lookinh the picture quality is good (note: purchase it if are going to game all day long. Don't buy it if you are going to watch movies and all) The refresh rate is good. Its written 21.5 inch its 22inch.Pros :VA Pannel quality is really good.Not soo much blackbleeding.Good Refresh rate.Hardy Built.Good amount of ports.Anti-glare coating is perfect.Cons:Viewing angles are sometimes terrible. (But still great for a VA pannel)A WEBCAM can be provided.At last of are going to buy this for gaming go for it..and if you are buying this for watching movies and all dont go for an IPS monitor.
5,"Out of the Box colors are not good..I had to manually set the colors with Nvidia panel...VRB set to extreme loses lots of colour details its set to normal for best...75hz refresh rate is good....Blacks are deep not grayish. ..I have nvidia gpu so no freesynce ......Display is finger print magnet.....Cons...The monitor buttons are hard to use it is recommended to download display widget software from Acer site....VRB lose brightness and colours..there is ghostig too.New..I changed the rating to 5 star from 4 star.This mobitor is really...Unlile anyother I see.No backlight bleed and No VA glow..deepest black you ever see.I actually order another one, will receive It at 28 aug..Then my build will be complete."
4,"Excellent gaming monitor. Came with a VGA and HDMI cable. Running great with 75hz refresh rate. Very crisp and rich display, looks amazing while playing games!Edit: After using for some time, I found that there is an issue with using AMD FreeSync on this monitor. Apparently the refresh rate used for FreeSync does not work well with HDMI and needs a DisplayPort which is missing on this monitor, so we need to turn the feature off otherwise the monitor starts showing black screen for any game or application running in full screen."
3,"Gaming:-Buy this monitor for gaming if you don't care about your eyes. To achieve 1ms (measured 1.7ms MPRT though it isn't mentioned in specification whether it is GTG or MPRT) response time it uses VRB. Which is a new technique to reduce response time by strobing back-light and that makes eye strain.Other than Gaming:-It has a response time of 12.7ms without VRB. And watching movie also a horrible experience. YouTube, NetFlix and Watching movie isn't recommended according to my experience.Real Bad thing:-What I was not expected from this price point of VA panel Monitor is ""Color banding problem"". It happens to lower color bit depth of monitor and in specification nothing mention about bit depth or color bit. At windows display settings it shows 8-bit but appears like 6-bit. By ignoring this problem color performance is very good, exceptional color performance for VA panel.Good thing:-The Black Level which is very Impressive. No back-light bleeding of panel glowing like IPS panel. Black are real rich black. I watched some HDR sample from YouTube which was amazing. Color is really good and should not have any major issue with professional work.I bought this for the black level. I tried off of IPS glow and Gray Black."
5,"Got the 27inch monitor for Rs 8800 after the card discount. No defects or issue found with my unit, although tamper protection from one side was broken. Writing this review after 10 days of usage.Things i liked about this monitor - 1. Best bang for the buck (27 inch monitor below 9000 rs)2. Decent built quality, plastic quality feels nice & robust3. No backlight bleeding4. No Ghosting5. 75Hz works flawlessly6. Good contrast ratioThings that needs to be improved1. 1ms VRB is a marketing gimmick, you wouldnt be able to use VRB as it makes the screen dark2. Color setting needs to be calibrated out of the box3. Monitor wobbles slightly4. 72% sRGB color gamut (Not to be used by designers)5. No audio out port from monitor / no inbuilt speakerOverall, if you get it for less than 10k it is an awesome monitor. For budget build, close your eyes and take this you will not regret."
4,"Great for the price, the viewing angles are pretty good considering it's a VA panel. Colours out of the box are pretty horrible but after doing some colour calibration and setting the gamma to 2.4, the screen looks pretty great. Just increase the saturation for all colours by 10, and set the gamma to 2.4"
5,I think if you are on a tight budget and want a gaming monitor for your setup then this is best asPros --Zero frame display-Blue light filter- easy menu and setting- 1 ms response time- 75 hz refresh rate- colour are also nice- v stand design looks amazingFor me this is the best monitor on this budget so no cons from my side.There is no -backlight bleeding or dead pixelAlso i had a acer monitor which i bought in 2011 and its still working so i trust acer more than any other company.At last this is the best monitor for gaming in this budget
5,"I have been using this product for about a month. This is the 27inch monitor from Acer.This is a decent product for the price range of about 13K. I use it for coding as I need a bigger screen to have multiple editors on them.Overall, the Youtube 1080p videos look sharp and clear. There are a good number of tuning knobs to suit settings to your convenience. The 75Hz display helps in keeping images sharp.The HDMI and VGA connectors are good too.  I'd recommend this product without any second thoughts.Although if your desk and room permits, I'd recommend a 32 inch."
1,So the monitor is not the sturdiest. The screen plastic is bulging out from the top (weak adhesive) but this was from day 1 so I didn't bother with it.But 3 days ago screen started flickering and showing that black dead spot.Upon contacting the service center to claim warranty they asked me to show the BIOS screen as proof that this is not a windows issue.I mean c'mon! I know they wanna give a thousand reasons so that they don't have to do a replacement but that is just down right stupid. So stupid that it sounds like they'd say ANYTHING callous to delay the warranty claim process as much as humanely possible.
3,I dont know why... But there is a gap between display and the body of the display. U can push the display inward to fill that gap but that is not permanent. Overall display quality is gud but if u are lucky enough to get the product without any manufacturing defect. I will upload the photo for reference.
4,"Hello my dear Gamers, I see you are on your hunt for a Gaming Monitor, something which is the best trade off between Quality and Budget... If the answer is yes, then you have arrived at the right place, because right now, in this review I will be doing just that for you...Let me mention some assumptions, so that its very clear for whom this review is good:1) You're an avid gamer, not a casual one... Coz if you casually play games it might not be your need to get more performance...2) You're PC specs are mid range... Coz If you are gonna have a 165 hz monitor your PC needs to pump out atleast 100 fps, for it to be worth it...3) Performance is of importance to you as you may be playing esports like cs:go or dota 2, valorant etc. Or even SP games like call of duty, assasins creed...Welcome to my review... I hope this review will be helpful to you in your gaming venture, and take your game to the next level...So for starters, let me tell you guys that I have purchased this monitor 2yrs ago, and people who have been following me, might know that all my reviews get testing time of at least a year... So the reviews are well tested on my side...I see some of you in doubt wondering about me being real gamer, some asking ""You're a gamer? Prove it...""So guys, I am an avid gamer from my childhood, and have played all the popular game series like COD, Assassins' creed, Bioshock, Half Life 2 series, Far Cry and tons of more. My favorite Esports include DOTA2 and CS:GO...So guys I had been using this monitor for 2 years, and in my opinion when I purchased it, this was the best bang for buck product, 2 years ago I could say it was wise decision to purchase this product, its price was lower, its performance was adequate for that time, but guys I would not consider it the best in 2021 or hereafter, You might question me why, why would such a nicely priced monitor from a renowned brand like acer, not be good choice, why indeed?Guys the simple answer to this is ""165HZ""... Monitors of  today are 165HZ refresh rate, 75 hz is getting outdated day by day... Guys when I bought monitor 2 years ago, there were 144 hz monitor not 165hz and the price difference between my 75hz and the 144 hz was a lot more than it is today between a 75hz and 165hz...Just remember this fact guys that the difference between a 75 hz monitor and 165 hz monitor  is so much greater than the difference between a 60 and 75hz monitor that its simply cannot be ignored... And guys the 165 hz monitor are only selling for 3-4K more than 75 hz. In my humble opinion its more worthy to buy a 165 hz monitor... Coz Higher refresh rate does matter guys... Atlest in esports, all the esport players might agree with my opinion I guess...I played on 250hz monitor for a few months as I was playing DOTA competitively, and it makes a massive difference guys... Higher refresh rate is better... I know I might not have to tell you guys, as you all might already be educated enough about it...But while making decisions some of us may fail, and so here I am to help those people, give them my helping hand by making the things very clear in front of them so they invest their hard earned money on the best product and get most value of it....If you are trying to switch from a 60HZ monitor then guys it will not be worth it, I would suggest you that instead you save more money, and try to buy the 165 hz one later...if your buying an entirely new PC and your budget is not allowing a 165 hz monitor, I would recommend that you either adjust with your current pc, and save more money so that you can get the 165hz, or if you are not having any current pc and this is your first one, well then you can try to maybe buy the CPU for now and connect it to your TV maybe... And later buy the 165HZFinal verdict: This monitor is not bad quality wise or anything, it is nice monitor but is outdated... Only if you are a casual gamer then this monitor will be good for you, otherwise 165hz is the present and future guys... Try to get it if you can...If my review helped you that means it was successful, if it didn't I share my apologies, but I had tried to explain it all in simplest language... You can google for any doubts you have... Have a nice day guys... GG"
4,Love it connected to my laptop this was worth the purchaseIt's generally 75hzCan be overclocked to 76hz nothing more1ms response time1080p vn displayColours not badShipped proper and came the next day even doe it said it would take 3 days I'm happy 😊Very fine bezelCan be mounted on a vesa arm.
1,"This monitor is not at all like the product described in the description. The colors are not at all accurate and good. I would have rated 0 stars if the option was available. The angle of viewing is also not great. You have to see it from the middle. The black color is grayish.If you are buying this monitor for gaming purposes, do not buy it at all! I rather suggest you buy IPS monitors which have accurate colors.Overall the product is ok, if you do not care much about the colors then it is a must-buy.The colors can be changed according to your need."
5,"I received this product today. I will edit this review after using it 1 month.First day experience :Monitor Big enough for gaming (27inches).Picture Quality is good. I played GTA V and the experience is quite good. Try to keep the monitor at distance from you while gaming. Because I know once we started gaming we never end, so even it was said to be anti effective to eyes if you play for long time It might.2 hdmi and 1VGA ports are given, so you can connect your old pc or laptop and you can switch them on your screen easily by using a Joystick 🕹️ button given backside of it. Best for console too.For watching movies, I can say if you want to buy it for watching movies (I mean for general uses) then go for it. Because of the monitor picture quality and its size you will get nice experience.Let's talk about build quality. At first time I saw the monitor I had a feeling the screen glass is a bit low quality one later then I checked it and It was fine. The weight of the monitor is Not bad. Actually the monitor was not supposed to be that much weight. They used quality materials (not that much) to build it.For some people who are using these kind of monitors for the first time. Don't be harsh while attaching the stand. There is a button in there just press it and push the stand with little force.A small suggestion, if you're buying this for gaming and you have any mid range or further low end gaming pc then try to buy small one."
4,"My experience so farSize:-21.5 inches is more than enough for me, although there is a 27 inch option.Display technology:- VA panel with deep blacks but bad viewing angles. The color accuracy is also fine for the price.Brightness:- 250 nits is good enough for my basic use with less ambient lighting, but might not be enough for you.Performance:- it has a refresh rate of 75 Hz and a natural response time of about 21 ms because it is VA, but acer has used 'VRB' technology to achieve 1 ms, but brightness will reduce significantly.Price:- The best price to performance I have seen for a monitor in some time.As long as it is between 8000 and 9000, it's a really good value.Conclusion: Recommended for casual gaming and basic use, but if you are planning anything more than basic work, look for IPS panel monitors for work and movie watching and TN panels for faster response times."
2,"Got red pulsating pixels all over the display as soon as I attached the HDMI cable. Tried with VGA cable, it was fine. Heaved a sigh of relief! Ordered another cable next day. It works fine on the new HDMI cable. A suggestion to the seller, please do better quality check on the supplied accessories. Free doesn't mean you just throw anything in the box. Really disappointed with quality control! Deducting one star because of the incident.****UPDATE****Bought another piece for a relative. Defective HDMI cable supplied again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Downgrading the rating from 4 star to 2 star!"

5,What a product man! You will instantly spot the difference between 5k full hd led and 8k acer gaming led.. difference is huge truly value for money! Build quality and sharp design added rough gaming look to my setup..it will come 59hz by default..set it to 75hz by windows display setting by going into advance display setting! Maybe i will help some buyers! And download acer widget tool from acer site for easy monitor access..good day
1,"its audio not working, can anyone tell me how to play audio from monitori have connected same via hdmi cable"
5,"I had wanted a monitor for my WFH as well as for gaming during leisure time and found this one suits well.But do note that this just a plain monitor without any support for speakers, USB, WiFi or Bluetooth. Supports only video incase of Chromecast or any other casting devices."
5,"A very good monitor for the price with a refresh rate of 75hz, supports freesync and 1ms response time.Includes power cord, HDMI cable and VGA cable. good packaging. Does not have speakers..."
5,Working pretty beautifully and I am very satisfied upgraded from 1366 to 1080p its a big upgarade fomlr mr go for it  😀  in extreme vrb lowers brightness but gives 1ms latecy good size and I upload videos edited it on YouTube channel OjusPlayZ it has arrived 2 day ago only and is working very fine !
5,"I won't go into tech specs. But the monitor will not dissappoint you. It's VA panel, but you'll hardly notice any difference in quality.I use it for programming. Texts are crisp and quite good.(-) It wobbles a bit on the stand, but that should be fine for 27 inch monitor.I would highly recommend for an affordable 27inch monitor."
4,"Everything about product was good,, but the stand which they provide little poor, for 27 inch monitor capable of stand is not good. For little shake of computer table monitor oscillating like spring coil.They provide VGA cable, HDMI cable everything,,Seller from Amazon is better than flipkar for this.First I order same model from flipkart,, they not even packed the product 8 days since I order.But I got the product within 2 days"
5,I bought this as a monitor for my home office and it does the job excellently. Colour reproduction is accurate and the occasional videos look just as good as they would on TV.
5,"I brought it for my work purpose and found its true value for picture quality, brightness can be controlled well and with reduced edges, it looks slimmer. Great buy, I am pleased with the product in my 2 weeks of usage"
5,Better than Samsung..Value of money....Build quality of the product is very good enough for this price range...No one is better than this 27 inch product in this price range...Contrast and risponse time is as specifications....No colour bleeding in this panel....Don't think twice ..Do order .....Thanks Amazon for your service..
5,"I am a avid ps4 gamer and have had 2-3 cheap budget gaming monitors around the same price as this, and without a doubt i can safely say that this is the best purchase i could have made, this monitor has an amazing response time amazing color quality and most of all it has a lovely screen, with a very minimal budget, if you have a budget between 5-10K i highly reccomend you to buy this product as it's just amazing, well so far on this ive used a PS4 Slim and a nintendo switch, both seem to work flawlessly and when it comes to playing on the ps4, games like call of duty run on a steady 60 fps with rarely any FPS crashes"
5,"Its6 perfect. I don't see any shortcoming as some are saying about this. It's a perfect for casual normal work. Good bright colours with good viewing angles too! (nobody sit in a diagonal position in front of the monitor)Overall, the best in this price bracket. Not much of a difference in IPS and VA. Both looks same. It's just if you place both the panels side by side, then only you'll feel slight difference otherwise it's VA panel is as good as IPS.Go for it!"

3,"I would have bought a different one if I had a choice at that time, this was good value for money. Overall a good Monitor although do not like the power source."
5,"Picture qualityis very good, respone is very fast.No flicker in pictures. Very good."
5,"Beautiful product. It's a must buy!The picture quality, the color precision, the touch and feel, it feels amazing to have this on my desk."
5,"I got it for around 11.5K. At this price point it feels like a great competitor to Benq IPS monitor.PROS:--------------------Sturdy AF monitor stand:This ensures that the monitor is sturdy and minimizes the wobble. It has a better stand most of the other brands at this price point as they all offer plastic stand, the wobble from which would definitely be noticeably more. I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.-Good Picture quality:Out of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.I didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.-Thin Bezels:The bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.-Budget friendly:There are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point. Zebronics has definitely done a great job here.-Indian Company:Although this may sound really stupid but this was one of the reasons why I actually bought this monitor as I wanted to try something new, specially from an Indian brand and I am actually impressed. Hence this long review.-Included Aux cable:This may not be useful for everyone, but it was good to see someone include a aux cable out of the box since this monitor has a audio out port at the back.-Vesa Mount:Can't praise Zebronics any more at this point.CONS:-----------------Only available in white color:I feel this is mostly depends on personal preference. I personally prefer black monitors as watching media on them feels more immersive.-Buttons on the side:The adjustment buttons are available on the right-hand side of the monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup then you have to make sure that there is no other monitor on the right hand side of this monitor since that would hinder your ability to do any adjustments using the side panel buttons. This somewhat beats the purpose of a slim bezel monitor.-Only VGA included:Most of the modern devices have HDMI as the standard video output port. Zebronics could have included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA since HDMI is a better standard to use than a VGA. (they don't differ alot in terms of pricing).I fell this leads to decreasing the price difference between this monitor and some other monitors as they already have HDMI included out of the box (Benq) and you would have to buy a seperate HDMI cable with this one.-No monitor adjustment:I don't think there is any way to actually adjust the monitor but the more than sturdy monitor stand kind of makes up for this con.[PS: A great purchase and would definitely recommend this to my friends and family]"
1,"The main issue with this device1. It's not FHD or HD, this Delhi made local product.2. ""It has 500000:1 dynamic contrast ratio for deeper blacks, brighter whites and rich colours"" it's completely fake. It's not true. This device is unable to display black colour properly.3. Assembling: Bottom side screw not properly tight and screw hole is not on proper position.4. Power adapter: 100% Local5. Power Cable: 100% Local"
4,Pro :Big screenpremium lookcon :1. brightness light make stress on eye even you tried to downgrade the brightness. not sitting work have an issue2. inbuilt speaker very low. even not auditable if you want to listen anything voice.but i am satisfied with overall  performance.
5,"Reviewing after a month of use, 60Hz 1080p display with very slim design. Display brightness is also good, Not using for gamming. but you can have decent output for that as well. most importantly it has 27inch display, which is definitely better to look at.Only issue I found that if you have a poor electricity wiring or no earthing, display turns off for a while when switching fan/bulb on/off (happened only once, might be due to low voltage supply). Also if you accidently touch the pin of your charger (Type c or B any) to stand of the display (which is made of metal) then it flickers. Disappointing!!!Apart from this issue, I found the display very well, no issues further."
5,That's my 15.6 inch laptop next to this monitor. It's very helpful for my office tasks and also to watch HD movies. Although I had to replace the monitor on the very same day as it didn't turn on. But got the replacement the very next day so no complaints on that.
5,Best for working don't purchase for gaming but best for working value for money best buy for it professionals
5,"This is a superb monitor, with good quality and cheap price tag.  Picture quality is good. Speakers are little disappointment, but what else you could expect in such price. Packaging was very good and secure and delivery was timely as well. Overall it’s a best monitor in this price range. Go for it."
5,"I bought this 27"" inch zebronics monitor for trending purpose and I m very happy to buy this good looking monitor"
5,Everything was good but quality was not up to the MarkCons - no warranty card received 🥺
5,"I must say . The best monitor at this price . 27"" for 12 k is just mind-blowing .I hope this monitor stands the test of time."
5,Best in price. Quality is ok according to price.
5,Awesome and good looking
5,Best monitor
5,"Worth the money and good quality. The stand is a little wobbly, but except that it is really good."
5,Good product
5,Awesome product.
5,Amazing desktop for show off andbest design build quality and best brightness level amazing desktop after all very less bezel or you can say bezel less
4,"Just to give you the expectations, the one the seller deliver is different. this monitor does not allow to tilt it forward and backward like others in this price range. The speaker is just a namesake, even the mobile speaker sound better than this. I have never used this monitor speaker, its bad super low voice, no one can hear. the button for brightness and contrast adjustment is complicated to use.Best part, it looks good, takes less space, the overall quality is good"
5,I think price is slightly high but quality screen size and design all is look fabulous.
5,Display was quite good
5,the monitor is very awesome
5,Really like it
5,i suggest buy under 15000 rs is best led
5,Best monitor ever
4,"It is a white frame and white plastic body at backside. I prefer black only. But the LED tv is slim in size,  frameless are beauty and stand design is more attractive. It would be helpful if the seller spply a wall bracket and a HDMI cable instead of VGA cable which is outdated now days."
5,Super
5,nice picture
5,Sandaar i like superb
5,Nice
4,"Its entry level monitor, not 4k, disply quality is poor compered to top brand like Dell,zebronics failed to compete with dell, samsung, LG"
4,Using after 15days..my decision is correct.. Quality and price are really great and perfect suitable for photoshop and video editing ( my opinion)
4,"Pros :- Nice product , ultra-slimCons:- little tilted , no height adjustment"
3,"I would give 5 stars for looks but 3 stars for picture quality as images looks washed out, contrast is not that good. Another najor drawback is that there is no tilt adjustment which would have been fine if by default the monitor didn't point slightly in a downward direction. As u can see in the image I had to manually tilt it backwards to resolve this by putting some cushining below the stand, 2 cardboard pieces u can see at each end. If u r looking to wall mount then I dnt think this should matter as I am assuming that monitor won't tilt downwards then, but I can't say as I haven't wall mounted it. I did a lot of research before buying n thought of giving this indian brand a chance but since there is no option to return this product I have kept it otherwise I would have returned it. Dnt go for looks, go for picture quality and buy any other brand."
4,Good
4,"Amazing Product. Really worthy at this price Range, Overall is is Good.Inbuilt Sound can be Improve a Bit..its Too Low...Rest is Great"
2,"Valur for money except for aux issue but won't recommend buying.Audio aux port doesn't work.Replaced the product received in another week but for new monitor also audio aux port is not working.Most people doesn't test it.I don't know if it works at all or just for showcase.Tried with aux cable that was in box ,tried other aux , earphone as well."
5,Trust me if you are looking for a DECENT PICE AND QUALITY MONITOR I would proffer definitely  because I was really scared of the comments which I saw above but when I received the product I really loved it for the money what I have paid it is fine because you do get the same size monitor with higher price BUT THIS ONE IS DEFIANTLY WORTH OF BUYING IAM REALY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT FROM PACKING TO DELIVERY PERFECT.
4,Display complaint
3,"THIS IS 4TH DAY REVIEW AFTER PURCHASE, DONT PURCHASE BY SEEING SPEAKERS, VERY VERY POOR QUALITY WITH 100% VOLUME ALSO YOU CANNOT HEAR, VERY BAD PERFORMANCE.PICTURE QUALITY IS GOOD,LOOK WISE ALSO OK, VERY SLEEK."
2,"Its installation and setup on table as well as on the wall is very confusing. There is no space/screw...for wall mounting. I tried to buy a wall mount for this monitor but could find one anywhere. I also visited its service center in Nehru place (New Delhi), surprisingly they also do not have any idea about how I can wall mount this monitor. Other wise in terms of design and look it's a good monitor."
1,"Please do not purchase this Lenovo Monitor, false description of product. and poor quality and poor customer service from Lenovo.1.  The monitor stopped working after 3 weeks. When raised complaint with amazon they refuse to refund.  and when raised complaint with Lenovo they took the complaint but provided NO solution even after 1 month of chasing around. The customer care simply said that the part is not available. Hence, they can't provide refund or monitor replacement.2. The monitor is not bezel-less, product pictures are misleading. Fool customers with bright looking pictures.3.  Monitor support only 60hz refresh rate @ 1080p and but the description claims this monitor to be full HD 75 Hz monitor.4. Heavy flickering.5.  Lenovo customer Care is horrible. demand daily followup for even a simple update. but no Solution.[ No support from Lenovo ] .It's a fake warranty. The service centers don't service monitors. And customer care is horrible.  Don't waste your money for Lenovo. It's like a sarkari office fooling you day on day on."
4,"I loved the design of the monitor and the sharpness of image it could produce. Was extremely satisfied with the purchase but suddenly the unexpected happened. My screen started flickering and stripes started showing up, even some ghosting occurred (see the images attached). I appreciate the seller that they accepted my return request and I got my refund without any fuss.Other than the bad experience with the unexpected flickering of the screen, I was really very happy with the monitor (which caused the 1 star)."
3,Am getting problem with my Mackbook pro. When I am using resolution 1600/ 900 color is coming yeloow. Only color coming 1080p am getting proper colour but moment it's feel all fonts images all pixel out. Can u help me to support
1,Do not buy this monitor simply it’s waste of money and waste of time.When I turn on for the first time it looks good with normal resolution after 3mins the screen goes warm white.I Resquested for the replacement but still I’m not satisfied.Worst seller😡
5,"Well i am totally impressed 😉 Picture quality is nice and crisp , Haven't tried playing any high graphics games but no issues seen with casual games. Bezels are thin though the edgeless feelings isn't there still the overall display looks neat..Connectivity is limited to HDMi and VGA serves the purpose for me as i will be mostly using it to coding and office worksAudio Out is there to connect speakers , The monitor also have speakers which are okayish nothing fancy good to listen slow and casual music and accept meetings calls , There is no bass though its somewhat better than  usual laptop speakers.Overall a nice product and i can recommend it easily..."
3,"Initially I ordered Lenovo Q24i-10 last week and it was delivered next day and but I got defective product(Display not turned on) so i spoke with Amazon customer care and made troubleshoot but not able to resolve it  so they agreed for replacement. i got the replacement product with in 2 day am Happy on Amazon Customer services.i was excited about this product since it was released in Jan2020 but after working for a day little disappointed. Product was made in very stylish look but Display was not so Great but it will be Average, Menu option were so poor and have decent Speakers, so if you have any idea of going to this product check other products below 10k and released in previous year hope that products also will have same Quality."
4,"Things I like1. Excellent looks, Minimalistic design, and edgeless screen2. Good color saturation3. Matte finish screen4. Blue light filter for eye comfort for long sittings5. Screen size of 24 is great to work withThinks I DONT like:1. Text is not as crisp. I guess higher resolution would have done better2. No wall-mount capability"
4,"Awesome monitor design wise but average picture quality.This is one of the best looking monitor and saves lot of space if you're primary source is connecting with a laptop. I used for both Mac and Windows and it works better on a windows machines with AMD FreeSync. Little bit disappointed with the quality of display overall as it is not a high quality panel and you will notice a little bit of pixelation especially while browsing and on texts although it is a 1080p panel, but serves the purpose for basic use. The inbuilt speakers are added advantage and okay for basic use, don't expect home theater like sound quality on a 3W speakers.Overall: 10/10 for design and 6/10 for picture quality and for the basic IPS panel"
3,"I received the monitor fairly quickly (2 days - thanks Amazon). picture quality is excellent and glare is considerably reduced compared to several other monitors in this range. It has a slim profile so does not take up a lot of space on your work desk. However, here are some cons:1. This monitor is not height adjustable neither can it be pivoted (from left to right), which means that the description on Amazon's product page is incorrect. This is very annoying as one of the main reasons I bought this specific model was that it claimed to be height-adjustable. It can be tilted a few degrees from back to front, but most people will find this feature to be pretty useless;2. Viewing angles are poor - anything more than 45 degrees in any direction and it fades. Great if you want screen privacy, pointless otherwise.3. The holes in the base where you insert screws to fix the monitor's stand to the base are poorly machined. In my case, one screw refuses to go in fully and the monitor's base, therefore, stands at a slight tilt. It's hard to notice unless you go looking for it, but it's still a manufacturing error.4. Speakers are below average. I had to crank up the volume to full to hear a YouTube video while sitting in a relatively quiet room; bass is non-existent. To compare,  I bought a Dell E2420HS a month ago with broadly similar specs and that has outstanding sound. I'd bought it for work, but ended up using it to watch movies."
5,"Works great with my lenovo laptop, since resolutions match. Had some trouble with my Mac though.The speaker output is adequate for meetings, I haven't used it for anything else yet. Sometimes the speakers are not automatically discovered after laptop wakes up from sleep, but replugging the hdmi cable worked.Happy with the purchase at the price point. Doesn't have height adjustable stand, not a major gripe, since most stands wouldn't have met my requirement.Looks great, works great. Go for it."
1,"The inbuilt sound is not working, and lenovo customer care is worst. They wont help you, they dont know anything. Just some stupid people sitting with phones. Dont buy lenovo products at all, worst service."
2,"In configuration it's mentioned 75 Hz, but it's not 75 Hz it's 60 Hz, Don't cheat customer's"
5,Excellent product both in terms of performance and looks. Extremely satisfied with the display.  Hva been using the HDMI port extensively with my laptop and it works perfectly. The hd and uhd quality videos are displayed with good effects and it's a wow experience when you play 1080 quality youtueb or other videos.
4,"This is a great monitor for this price.Pro's:Great size and buildBrilliant design, looks sleekGood Resolution, clear text and imagesCon'sHeight of stand cannot be adjustedSpeakers are not too great, but not badAll in all, if your use of a monitor is to program, just watch shows on Netflix, or just use it as an extension of your screen, I would recommend this monitor highly.HOWEVER, if you're an avid gamer or have anything to do with design, I think there are better monitors out there, probably at a higher price tag, maybe around 15,000 INR"
4,"Loved the monitor, it is sleek, has a good picture quality, however it is advised not to rely on the speakers cause they are just for normal use, you can have a separate speaker set to have an overall premium sound quality. it is adjustable but not in terms of height. so that's a drawback. Other than that I think it's a great monitor for work from home and movies.  And to those saying it is a Chinese product, I totally agree but name an alternative to this? No Indian manufacturer can produce at this cost and quality yet, someday I'm sure they will. let's hope it comes soon!"
3,The display itself was good very sharp and natural....but the display flickerd and vertical lines started to appear just with 3 days of usage...saw similar issues being reported by other users......with the this much price dont take risk.
5,"Have been using the product for about a week now, and thankfully no problem has come as of yet. Sure the picture quality is not top notch but you can't get 2K quality for 12k money right? For what it costs i would say the quality is amazing. The texts looks crisp enough and the pictures have an average-good color quality. Coming to the design and aesthetics, this thing is amazing. In whatever table or desk you keep this, it instantly becomes beautiful and professional/creative. I haven't faced any issues like light bleeding or lines as of now(1 week). If anything happens I'll be sure to update it here :)Update: The monitor is good, but there's a small catch.. this monitor only has a ONE HDMI port. So in today's world in which we're juggling bw work and personal laptop this monitor makes it difficult."
3,Product is good.  But I didn't like the packaging or I think they have given me a returned product. Proof is you can see in the first two pictures the sticker which is in bottom of the monitor came out. It's not glued properly.Second thing the bottom part of stand does not look new. There are lot small/big scratches.I wasn't expecting this...Otherwise product is good. You should buy it.
4,"Looking at the advertisement, I felt that this is the best product, however after getting delivered, it reached 80-90% of my expectation. Overall, it is a good product, but over-hyped with the advertisement."
4,"Excellent picture quality. The anti glare is very effective as well.However, my son says the fps varies when he plays games (which apparently does not happen while using the laptop screen). I haven't found any cause for complaint except for the speakers which are just there to tick a check box."
5,I purchased this monitor for my desktop PC. As promised Amazon delivered to me before time and I am happy with their service. The PC has every feature i was looking for and it is useful for my purpose. Amazing colour and display. The added advantage is the sound system which is built in.
1,"Please don't get impressed by the advertisement, the product is not good by any means. Not worth buying. Poor contrast, poor brightness, poor picture quality. Yes the design is really good. Ok for light uses, but heavy usre should look for something else."
5,Reviewing after 4 months.Nice monitor for office work.Don't expect so much from speakers. Speaker is just OK.Rest everything is great and worth the money.
1,The display got damaged just after a day of usage. Looks like lenovo has used low quality parts in this one..
1,"Monitor display turns blue with lines. Worst customer service by Lenovo. Suggest not to buy this, not worth the money. They don't have monitor servicing in bangalore and no engineer visit option as well. No clear mail communication."
1,I am trying since installed the monitor with PC but don't know wether sound is there or not in monitor as tried with Aux cable also but there is no sound from the monitor. Is it my monitor is faulty or my pc is faulty but as soon as I connect with other speakers sound plays but not ⏯️ ng sound through monitor
3,"Bought this monitor after so much of study and finally, I am ok with it, however, its sound quality is not at all ok.One will able to listen from 2-3 feet distance from the monitor with a normal low-quality sound.So when you compare this with similar other monitors, it is not up to the mark... not as expected in terms of its sound quality."
5,I received the order in time with good package. It have option to protected the eye.Even still now I don't  not found any issues.
1,"I have ordered this product and got defective product, I am trying to replace/get refund since 28th sep 2021, every time Amazon customer support creat picup, till date more than 7 pickup have been created but no one came for pickup.Please do not order expensive products from Amazon. Very bad experience.Horrible sevice by Amazon."
4,"Monitor is looking very stylish and picture quality is awesome. I selected this monitor because among other features it also has inbuilt speakers which was missing in most of the other brands and models.But, the sound quality of the speakers is very poor. I can say it is below average. But apart from that everything is good. If you don't worry about the speakers quality then you can go for it. Very worth."
3,Nothing fancy except look. You cannot adjust height...serves the purpose... Worth of price?
5,It's an amazing monitor ... With premium build quality all metal stand and excellent picture quality
3,Actual bezels are more thick than lenovo is marketing.
5,"Excellent display quality, sleek and item as described on Amazon. Sound comparatively low as compared to other monitors"
4,"Wonderfully packed, nicely finished, clear performance for now, hoping not to see any problem.Just silken experience while handling the package and using the product."
4,Display is nice. Using on 75hertz with macbook 16. Sound output could have been better. Mind it u cannot move it sideways but top and down only.
5,Price is bit high- but product is awesome- very satisfied
1,"This is NOT a full HD monitor, as the product description says. I purchased this product and had to return it back. Also the in the Q&A section, the seller is again giving wrong information about the product being 1080p."
1,Received in damaged condition. Though it would have solved my purpose. But now have initiated return.
4,Not IPS display. Viewing angle is very narrow.
5,I like that product too much. I was confused by reviews to purchase or not but one its deliver I realised 50% reviewers are wrong product is very good in cost. Excellent quality.
4,good product but definitely needs a lot more improvement but i think in this price range its okay
4,My laptop screen got dameged and stoped working. So i am useing this as support screen for my laptop. My purpose is solved.
1,Just after three weeks my monitor having a green line on the screen. Please replace this. Don't buy.
1,Don't like returning procedure too much Questions.and not to buy again anytime . And no response as at

5,Fit and forget using as CCTV monitor

5,Value for money
1,QualityNot full hd
4,I like it because it is small but smart the specs are outstanding at this price range having VGA and HDMI both
2,Products is good but not a full HD
1,The product is showing red hue in background instead of normal and cannot read characters.
5,"The monitor looked great when i opened it out from the box. Setting the stand up was so simple, no tools required. It came with the VGA cable, HDMI Cable, power cord, installation disks. I connected the monitor to the power socket and the monitor turned on. There were several big cracks on the screen. It was very disappointing to look at. I connected to the computer anyway to check. But the cracks still remained. Setting up the monitor as a external monitor to my vaio laptop was also very easy using the HDMI cable.  Just go to screen resolution option from control panel and select Use the external monitor as primary display. But the cracked screen is a big disappointment. I have placed request for a replacement. Hope the replacement is good.Edit1: I got a replacement monitor. Which has been working absolutely perfect so far. The replacement process was hassle free."
5,"Having worked with multiple monitors for quite a long in my office, I really got used to work multiple monitors setup.I always felt incomplete while doing my personal stuffs without an additional screen. So I did my research and decided to buy this. Kept this in my wish-list for about 2 months and ordered during Oct 2018 sales @ 6400 after all discounts.The monitor is really nice looking, sharp colors and picture quality, and energy efficient. Comes with both VGA and HDMI cable.I do really like it but if you are looking for a gaming monitor, you would probably want a monitor with comparatively lesser refresh rate. Although, I do not feel any issue while general gaming."
1,The seller Appario is not responding to mails. The monitor stopped working and i can't claim warranty because there's no serial number mentioned in the invoice. Unsatisfied with the product and the seller
5,Only one word........ Very sexy
5,"Initially I needed the a monitor to connect to my laptop for writing code and development purpose. However, I'm currently using this to play latest games in HD on my PC and the dispay is quite serene and vivid. The external appearance of this monitor is also good and it looks very sleek with this metal finish. Overall I'm very satisfied with the performance and display of this monitor, however the only con it has is a loose and weak mount. The join between the display and mount isn't of great quality and the monitor shakes a little even when placed on a perfectly flat surface. One accidental touch and it moves in all directions. The join should have been more firm and a better screw would have kept it intact. No complaints at this price and it's a perfect deal so go for it. It's unarguably the best 22 inch monitor in this range. Even beats the corresponding Samsung curved monitor when it comes to quality and high quality gaming."
1,"after i purchased it one & half year of usage, monitor got problem, it gets input button pressed automatically and screen shuts off and on continuously,  seller wintel systems updated wrong serial number on invoice so i had to waste 2 weeks to get new invoice from seller, negligence of seller & amazon! And next comes big torture by HP support through watsapp and also call, first of all guys who work in first level support have very minor technical knowledge and when i bought them new invoice, i gave them invoice and screenshot 5 times, still they didn't update it in the case id 5025070550, sheer work negligence, no way available to escalate this issue, Regretting badly for buying a HP product. Seller, HP whoever are only interested in money, once you buy it, they don't care anymore. Better stay away from HP products."
5,"Surprisingly, it's a really good screen. I was having a mixed feeling until I receive the product. The reviews here are confusing and really misleading. If you get a damaged product, don't give a bad review, it might have happened in transit. You return and replace, then write review. It's more than good for what you pay. Loving it. Easy to install, simple and clear instructions provided. Comes with power chord, VGA and HDMI cables."
5,"Awesome monitor, comes with a even better packing with all components completely sealed and protected. The monitor is surprising thin with just less than 1cm in thinckness, the lower portion which holds the circuit is little thicker but still much less than many other monitors. The resolution, clarity and viewing angles are great and produces sharp and clear text and images. Only drawback i felt was the fixed lower part of the stand which compels the monitor to be away 5-6 inches from the wall, but that I think is to maintain the balance with the stand, over all not much a problem if one has a little bitter table and can keep the monitor away from the eyes as much as possible."
5,"Update: Switched to HDMI input and display is perfect. VGA output on my system or the cable (or both) could have problems but over HDMI everything is great.I am not a web designer but I think the colors on this monitor are very good. As mentioned by another reviewer, there is a mode that reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the monitor which is good for reducing strain on the eyes when working late into the night. I use the monitor mainly for programming, some web development and watching videos.---got this monitor a few hours ago. connected it to my laptop with the VGA cable and i am seeing significant banding in the regions of the screen which are mainly white/bright. this is really distracting. I am going to wait for a cable i ordered in order to be able to use HDMI with my laptop (it is a mini displayport to HDMI cable, my laptop doesnt have an HDMI port) and test again. If I still see the banding I will initiate a return/replacement."
1,"High Blue light, pixels are not so perfect, you can't work on this monitor for long time, it looks to be just HD display only, I don't feel the full hd quality, it's below than what it really suppose to be... Not much suitable for whole day office work. Getting heavy eyes straining even after a short time usage.... I don't have return option, so have to adjust with it.... Its slim and very fance just hardware."
3,"I would have returned it but, I guess I am too lazy to do that. Don't get me wrong. This is a really great monitor. There is one huge flaw in the piece that I have received though. The sliding lock mechanism that holds the screen on the stand seems to be broken. This means that the screen might slide off if someone rocks it. I guess they are deliberately selling faulty products here on discounts. I am giving it 3 stars."
1,First I received a faulty product!then I verified it with pictures with amazon representative and then he initiated a replacement order.but when the delivery man arrived with a new package he asked me to verify the product again!I told him my problem and showed the defected product.But he could not understand it.He did not gave me the replacement product and canceled my replacement!Update: I initiated a return of the product but no response from amazon. I want my money back!
4,"Just bought this product for home browsing, and working on programming in the evening time. Packaging was job well done and shipped a day before projected time line by Appario. Products from dell and hp doesn't look shabby either. IPS screen as you all know its advantage and disadvantages over tnt and others, is minimalistic in aesthetic, haven't seen any dead pixels yet, decent refresh rate for my purpose, and screen reflection is minimal. VGA and HDMI IO connector lines with respective cables comes with the package along with driver, and power adaptor cable,  Overall a good product."

1,"3rd class category!First I have ordered and they gave me damaged piece.Then have replaced me same product. It will be running good, but on the 21st day it's getting vertical lines on the monitor.Strongly recommend no to buy"
1,"I was really excited when I got this monitor, but in just one day started to have issues with dark colours. There are pink dead pixels on any black image, and it's getting worse overtime. Sometimes the screen just shuts off for a second and turns back on. There's something really wrong with this display, I have ordered a replacement."
4,"I have two of these monitors, both ordered from Amazon.The monitor is a great for work but it is not as good for watching movies.When you have dark moments while watching a movie, the whiteness from the sides of monitor is clearly visible.Some people may find it annoying.Other than that, its a good product for its price."
5,"Hello,I am writing this review after 9 months of purchase. I got it for less than 7.5K during sale. This has been one of the best purchases I have made so far. I use it as secondary screen for my MacBook. Sometimes I feel that this monitor's picture quality and color saturation are much better than Macbook 2015 model's picture quality. One of the best feature is anti-glare.Only issue I found is the monitor stand. There is vertical adjustment. You cannot use it with other monitor stands. For this you need to buy a separate clamp to use it with other monitor stand. This is true for all the ES series models.You won't regret buying this monitor.Thanks,Raghav Nayak"
2,I returned this monitor without even checking the picture quality. The stand is poorly designed. It is shaky and leaves the screen in tilted position. My first call to amazon to request a return left me totally unsatisfied after going through cross-examination with the agent. But the person I talked to on my second call was lot more helpful and started the return process rightaway. Amazon should understand that people spending 5 digit sums without seeing the product and just reading the reviews which are greatly suspect - those buyers have right to be unsatisfied if the product doesn't justify the price paid.
5,"The monitor provides clear, crisp and strain free viewing pleasure. I had already purchased the HP 4K 27” monitor and was happy with the build quality, design and viewing experience. That’s why I decided on this monitor for my child’s “study from home” experience. It’s a great buy and will certainly help parents who are looking at a monitor for their child’s desk"
1,"Left one is my old monitor HP22ES, Left one is the new monitor HPM22F Strongly recommend not to purchase. Picture quality is not good. If you are graphic designer / image editor pls dont buy. Display Colors are absolutely wrong. In the name of eye safe they produced a green display."
1,The warranty is only available for 5 more months.Its kind of cheating.Amazon should check the warranty for all these kind of products.
4,"Overall aesthetics (looks) is pretty impressive when you see it in person, Way more better than the pictures or videos. Anti-Glare screen is awesome, Image quality is good.For designer's, I don't know but i felt coulour to be more yellowish, idk why that too without night mode.Had lots of light bleeding with black background, might be because of the transportation which is not noticeable with colour screen much.Overal all good monitor for this budget for daily usage or for those who require a bigger screen, i just felt for designer's this might not be the best choice in terms of colour. (maybe its just me)"
5,"Absolute Thin display, edges could have been reduce little bit, while working edges visible on 3 sides , bottom edges also very less. nice look,HP packing was very nice, though it is recycle material cable material could have been improve more.Amazon packing was worst, they supply with extra large box with no safety packing inside those extra space, instead they can ignore amazon's extra packing. that will be save environment, useless big box without safety items.Thanks amazon for fast delivery.product release at may2021, how the product reviews is written at 2 years( which mean from 2018 2019 onwards)before dated, really confusing me to choose this product and buy, suggestion to amazon to post related product review. with lot of confusing after reading review now i am satisfied with purchase.please post related review to related product and images also."
3,"Picture quality and build quality is awesome but there's backlight bleeding. The replacement i got had the same problem but way worse so i asked for a refund. Everything else works fine, no flicker and good brightness."
1,Picture quality is not good. If you are graphic designer / image editor so pls dont buy.White colour is ok .But Grey colour looks black ya dark grey.
4,"I purchased this monitor for personal and office works. It has good display, reclining angle (only upwards and downwards in landscape orientation). Not of so much weight. Installing it on a desk on its stand is so easy. It came with a setup CD having supporting software. I'm yet to test ""Anti-glare"" functionality fully, so not rating that feature.I have a concern regarding warranty. I got a monitor which was manufactured in August, 2018. Amazon claims that product has a warranty of 3 years, I purchased it in April. I lost 7 months of warranty period on checking in HP website. For that, I'm rating it as 4."
5,Awesome monitor. Looks very classy on a table. Easy to connect and use. Color reproduction is good. Sturdy stand. I'm not a gamer so no idea if it is good for gaming. Great for working on office tools and surfing side by side. The slim bezels are quite thin. Could have been a bit more brighter. It also has blue light filter to make it easy on the eyes. Comes with an HDMI cable and VGA cable.
1,"This product is really awesome but, due to manufacturer defect in my pics, after 3 days monitor was automatically blinking continuously, may be piece is faulty, overall clarity of this product is awesome don't think much go ahead"
3,"This product stopped working after an year. This monitor also had an issue of shutting down the display for few seconds and recover automatically. Either I got a lemon or pretty bad luck. Either way I am at lose.The company replaced unit under warranty.  And, the new unit is working as expected so far. Probably I have received a defective product initially."
5,Its a great monitor for office work. As it has an IPS panel viewing angles are bright and efficient. Anti-glare works great. I've given only two stars for gaming as it comes with a 60 Hz display and gaming nowadays demands atleast 120 to 144 Hz display. Still best monitor you'll ever get at this price point
5,I bought it for my parents. I had two old laptops whose displays were not working. So I decided to get this to get those laptops to use.  Picture quality is very good. Even with VGA connection I feel like I am having 1080p picture quality. Feels great when you see on this monitor. Bezels are thin. Also the screen size is bigger as compared to laptop. Go for it. I just wonder how the hackintosh will look on this monitor which will be ready by next few days.
5,"I bought this for around 8500 bucks and been using it for over a year and a half. The monitor is awesome at its price point. However, the control buttons on my screen started malfunctioning. But HP service was great and they replaced the monitor altogether. Overall, the picture quality is great. The bezels are thin except at its chin. Looks aesthetic."
1,"I purchased this monitor a year and a half ago and was impressed initially. Over the months however, quality has degraded completely to the point that there are hundreds of dead pixels and white/green/pink/blue/red lines all across the screen at random places, which flicker and move about the screen.I will update this review if and when HP honors their 3-year warranty policy."
5,I must say that I am impressed with it. The monitor is really easy to assemble and you can set it up within minutes. One HDMI cable and one VGA cable is provided by HP in the box. The monitor is quite thin as compared to others in this category. The overall performance is amazing. Colours are bright and the LED display looks beautiful. There are buttons at the bottom of the monitor to adjust the display settings as per your requirement. There’s also a blue light option which you can switch on to avoid stress on your eyes. This is a must buy monitor in the 22inch category.
1,"Build quality is poor,In description it's mentioned 75hz, but doesn't go beyond 60hz"
5,Perfect secondary screen for my trading setup. My purpose was to monitor the stock movements.. meanwhile I do my daily office tasks on my mac.
1,Purchased it a while ago. It was fantastic to begin with but after 2 yrs it started giving problems.. flickering button etc. It can happen to any monitor but most surprising part was pathetic service. Could not trace call centre no. The one got was not valid. What's app chat is just for show 24*7. They don't respond to it in hrs. Dont know what to do now. If I would have been aware of pathtic service I would have chose some Chinese prod which is cheaper without warrenty.
4,"If you are in market looking for a good sleek monitor under 10k, this is it !!  II have had this monitor for about an year now with only 1 small complaint(mentioned below). But apart from that total vfm. The sleek design gets a 10 on 10 from me. and the immersive experience that comes along with thin bezzels is like a treat to eyes. HP well done.Issue: I have this monitor connected permanently to my Lenovo thinkpad laptop, but I keep facing this random issue, where the edges on the monitor are blurry(not hardware issue) The solution to which is go in the monitor settings and hit auto adjust. I have tried different cables and monitor."
4,"It's a good monitor for both work and play. But picture quality could've been more vivid. It supports HDCP on HDMI connection so you can watch Amazon Prime, Netflix in HD or higher quality graphics. Also not a choice for hardcore gamer, but for casual or occasional gamer it's perfect..."
5,"The below reviews are based on my usage after approximately 1 month & have included some comparisons with my other monitor Acer RT240Y(the left monitor is Acer in my photos), as both are similarly priced. Please note that this is a 2020 model for Dell, and mine was manufactured in March 2020. It comes in the box with HDMI cable, so that is a good thing for plug & play!Pros:1) This is E2420HS which the seller provides,which actually is supposedly a costlier model than E2420H, which is a good thing!2) Loved the height adjustment for the monitor (can be seen in the photos) which I don't get in my other monitor RT240Y. I liked this!3) Speaker of this monitor is surprisingly good! Of course,it does not have enough bass or anything for music playback, but for Skype, usual content, movie watching etc this should do very well.4) Packing for this model from seller is absolutely top quality!Cons:1) NO 3.5mm audio jack for the monitor. So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output. Liked it better on my RT240Y3) This is mostly nitpicking, but the monitor swirls sideways on the stand. I wanted the entire unit more Sturdy if possibleOverall, a good buy & I can definitely recommend. I am super surprised on the speaker quality for this monitor so that overcomes all cons for me personally."
2,The placement of input ports - HDMI and power are badly placed - struggle to connect to input devices - mine also came with loose power port connection so with slightest movement the power would get disrupted.. Also no Bluetooth ports or anything and sound output is low .. not worth 10K that I paid for ... also had to buy 15 to 5 A. Plug converter to use in the house else u will have to unnecessarily occupy the ac/ iron plug points ... Make sure u have one before the 10 day return policy wanes away
5,"Dell E2420HS. Yes, it is E2420HS, as the product images suggest (but description is of E2420H). It is an awesome product. Side bezels are thin, has in-built speakers. There are no Display Port, but HDMI instead. We can use it as TV also, by adding ChromeCast hardware through HDMI port. Great deal..!!!"
2,"No It does not have a display port, wrong information by seller. The main reason for me to buy this is item two ports HDMI and DP , it does comes with only HDMI and VGA."
2,"16 AMP plug provided, No VGA provided.. in this lockdown where will go and buy these two items and test it .. not expected from apparoretail .. very bad ... Spoiled complete experience.."
1,product details are completely wrong as given in the details. As it has been written there is an USB PORT which is present in the monitor and while we checked on DELL site and even talk to the customer service about the issue they clearly mentioned that the product does not have any USB port as mentioned in the product details in amazon. And the support service of amazon does not have that much of idea regarding the product they r selling.
5,"At this price, the only one i could find with all features1. 24 inch2. Adjustable height and angle3. Had speakers4. Vesa compatible5. Hdmi and vga*Speakers* are very low volume so i don't use them, quality is also not that great but ok ok. You probably won't get much better at this price.*Build quality* is a bit light, it shakes a lot if you shake it. It's mostly plastic and does not feel very solid. But, i only notice this when i was installing and when i try to adjust the height. For something that stays on your desk all the time, it doesn't matter much anyways, so i won't make a big deal out of this oneIt switches input automatically when input changes so it works well with multiple inputs.As for *screen quality*, when it stands next to my U2412 (which is an ultrasharp) i can see ultrasharp gives much better colors compared to this monitor. I had a tweak lot's of color settings to make them match up. It's not possible to match the color settings with an ultrasharp.So do understand this is a cheap monitor and the colors will look a bit faded/yellowish when stood next to a better monitor.That said, if you keep it standalone, you won't notice any screen quality issues at all! Your eyes will adjust and you won't notice any issues.Even i use it daily next to the ultrasharp i don't notice the quality difference unless i am actively looking for quality issues.I would say for this price point the feature set you are getting is awesome 👌.  If you are on a budget, go for it you won't regret. If you can stretch a bit more, you should be able to get an ultrasharp for maybe 7-8k more (maybe even less)"
4,"Good monitor in its price… but can’t be compare with LG’s picture quality.Good for office use..,Surprisingly good stereo  speaker in it.., enough for my office desk ( not a loud speaker, maximum 5 feet only audio hearers., but that’s what I want..,  )I am using for this monitor as a alternate display for my laptop.., Text are not looking sharper but not bad at all..Mainly I used for its height adjustment feature, and it really works well…No more neck pain 👍Overall a good monitor with average picture quality compared to lg"
3,"First I brought Samsung led monitor 24inch I got replacement and returned due to it have back light bleeding and patch of grey circle and dead pixels.. Then I gone for Dell 24inch it doesn't have baseless border no fear of light bleeding but the 1080p 60fps video on VGA and HDMI was not that good compared to Samsung it have 1080p video quality of crystal clear ... In Dell the 1080p video are blurry and not clear . 60FPS is also lagging not smooth on full screen. I mainly brought it for working purpose so I ignored and using it now.For good picture quality and movie , gaming lovers don't buy Dell you may dissapointed in the fps and video output..For working professionals it is good most office use dell only go for it... For 10.3k it is not worth I think , if video quality is good and fps is smooth I would give 5 star to this.PS: height adjustable and speakers are just gimmicks... Personally I don't find use of height adjustment and speakers. I use my own sound system instead of it. Inbuilt speakers not good as 2.1. If you find dead pixels dell policy states"" it is common to have 1-4 dead pixels ""."
3,"This monitor comes with a 15 AMP plug as if we have to run a geyser! Ridiculous. Whoever is buying this product, please be aware of this limitation. I have not checked with an adapter, not sure if its safe or will it blow up the warranty.Update on 18-aug - Dell says there is a government directive to provide 16 AMP plugs with monitors. This is per ISI standards, which still perplexes me. So they have no choice but to provide a 16 AMP plug. I have purchased a plug that fits into a 5 amp socket for the monitor spending 300 rs, seems to be working well. Looks like this is the norm."
4,"I purchased 24"" DELL monitor. It was delivered within couple of days and price was also very competitive. Easy to assemble.Two issues 1) The monitor came with 15 amps power plug which is not suitable for 5 amps power socket at homes. Fortunately I had 5 amps power plug from my old monitor that came handy to swap.2) Outer package was damaged at several places, however the inner packings [ looks like they were the original DELL packaging] in good shape and hence the package survived transportation. Not sure why the outer package is so much damaged for branded electronic items."
4,"Works well for general use. Also does a decent job of videos & movies. Speaker is an advantage. Easy set up. Must use good quality cables . Works well with DP to HDMI cable also. Had a glitch with a 3 port HDMI  switch, but worked fine after changing to a better quality switch. Height Adjustment is the best part. May not suit Gamers."
5,I bought this monitor at the wonderful price of 8500 only. Thanks to amazon and SBI credit card for the discount.Speakers quality and sound is amazing.Ergonomic design of monitor gives perfect look.Superb pictures quality.
2,"Huge 3 pin plug! Why ? Can't fit in ups or power strips.Yellowish off white tint. Deal breaker.Absolute pain to contact non existent dell customer support. Can't email or chat, call center calls get disconnected"
3,Overall Monitor is good in terms of built in speaker and height adjustable design. Picture quality is not as per spec. Display doesn't look like not as per LED monitor standards. Also there is white color bleeding  appearing at the top left corner of the display after 3 days of use.
4,Good monitor for daily use. Good feature of adjustable height. Using it just for an week now. No issues as such. Easy to assemble. 16a power chord provided. Please ensure you purchase a 6 amp to 16 amp converter before purchasing the monitor.
1,Someone wrote in Flipkart that Dell has given 16amp plug as if we're using the monitor in Kitchen and Bathroom!! Just wanted to mention that here. Don't buy this unless you have the big plugin used for Geyser and Grinder :-D
2,"display is good , but the in built speakers are not good"
5,"Very sturdy monitor, ready to use out of the box with easy stand mounting screws, has comfortable height adjustment. The pack had a HDMI cable. Advise to users, ensure you get a power plug adapter to suit your home 5amp socket while buying. After long research I bought this and am very happy with the decision. Good for WFH use."
4,"Monitor comes with HDMI and VGA Only, not DP, VGA and HDMI as mentioned in the description. I am using the monitor with multiple devices which needed DP cable connection, hence purchased it, but now i have to buy a convertor to use this monitor. Rest everything is great. The Height adjustability and FHD display and sound... Another Minus is there is no 3.5mm jack to connect external speakers to the monitor directly."
4,Its a good moniyot for the price offered. Suitable for notmal office wotk and entertainment purpose. Well built. Will lsst long for sure.
4,"You can adjust height accourding your comfortInbuilt speaker quality is awesome.When you touch it or its accessories like wire, hdmi etc you will feel quality of DELL.16amp socket di h power k liye, pahli baar kisi monitor m dekhi h,"
5,"I have been using this monitor in my office. this is very good for text based works, like coding in IDE or terminal. This does not create pain in eyes. It has speakers as well in it."
2,The power cable !! 16 A for a monitor for home users and no mention of it in the product spec as well.
5,You can buy Samsung LED display with extra 2k by adding to price of this display. LED monitors are better than LCD. They don't hurt eyes as compared to LCD monitors does.
5,Picture quality is good. It's height adjustable and has both vga and hdmi port. Very good for office work.But they gave 15 amp power cable and vga cable was also missing. I had to buy both the cables separately.
4,1080p resolution is not good enough for 24 inch screen. Sometimes there’s visible pixels but many times it’s not noticeable. The picture quality is good. Overall product is very nice considering price segment.
4,"Monitor is good but like many other monitors this one also comes with 16 Amp Power cord which usually doesn't fit in our normal switch boards, Have to purchase separate power cord."
4,Picture quality is good. It's inbuilt speakers are fine. It has one HDMI port and one VGA. It doesn't have USB and Bluetooth. It has height adjustable and tiltable features. Overall it's a good product.
3,"You need a 15A socket to fit the power cord. While 32 inch HP monitor comes with 5A pin, why this 24 inch monitor need a 15A outlet? Can the supplier clarify?  Frustrating!!!"
5,"This monitor is perfect for the working professional, additionally, it has an inbuilt speaker, not that good quality but works perfectly if you are IT professional. Clarity wise it's perfect for work, watching movies, playing games etc."
2,"It comes with a 15 Amp power plug, now where am I supposed to go and get 15 Amp to 5 Amp converter during this lock down in bangalore."
1,Received damaged product and they refused to accept return
5,Video and text quality is superb and  inbuilt speaker quality is also good.A ll things are available as I was expecting
1,"I didn't like this products at all, I have found this Damage products,There is Irregular White line appear on the Screen,I don't recommend this to buy From Online,"
4,Display and speakers are most like and only rotation is missing
3,Low volume speakers and also picture quality is not good
1,Current supply  wire is not good to dell monitor it is worst
5,Excellent so far and especially speakers as pointed out by many.
4,Speakers are normal. I am not satisfied with screen there should be more mode and contrass ratio of B/W is less as compared to other monitors.
2,If you are selling product in india then make sure you provide commonly used power cable size .....Power cord is not compatible with home sockets ...if so many negative review about power cord then why don't provide appropriate cable
4,The power cable received with the monitor is larger in size and doesn't fit into any household socket. I had to buy a new one.Otherwise monitor is awesome.
4,"Size of monitor is decent, looks big.Clarity of the picture is not so great, you can see that in the attached image.I have played a 4k YouTube video, clarity looks pretty good but it's not same with the image.Installation the monitor is pretty straightforward and easy installation.Monitor comes along with HDMI cable, power adaptor."
5,VERY Clean & Crisp Picture Quality.You can choose what picture quality you want.Totally Love it!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
5,First I want to thank Amazon for delivering the product one day before the alloted time.Packaging of the product was very niceScreen was much bigger than I expectedPerformance wise I would not be able to comment untyi use to for fee more days.
5,They have mentioned ---Hardware Interface USB Type CBut there's nothing as TYPE CLED is good no doubt
5,Its a beautiful monitor. I have always LOVED dell monitors and their calibration with colours. I have not touched the default colour setting it has come with.Its very easy to assemble and setup. The screen is bright and good enough for my work requirements.It does not come with AMD Freesync or with NVidia GSync tech and I was not interested. NOT A GAMING MONITOR!!!In all a basic monitor for daily use without the bells and whistles and sometimes simplicity is the best.
5,"As expected.... Brand is always a brand.. Dell is goodScreen clarity is goodWide viewing angelAnti glare is okGaming.. Am not gamer, but I play very less graphic games, it's work well in itOverall worth buying"
5,"Very nice monitor, worth the buy. This review is being written on the second day after buying. Shall update if things change over a period of time.Delivery and packaging was neat. Assembling the stand is pretty straight forward and easy.Only problem is that the plug is bigger for a normal household plug point. Had to buy a converter pin."
5,"Good clarity power cable is not suitable , it's plug is big size .And remaining everything is good only"
4,Quite good in this price range. Only problem the bigger size of plug in power cable. We cant use unless you plug in 16 amp borad which usually use for high watt utility like Fridge AC etc
1,"I am not able to connect this monitor to my desktop but when I connected other monitor its connected, request you to please exchange the monitor or take the monitor return."
4,Both the cables are not compitable with regular sockets.Please replace the cable
2,The product cannot be returned if you don't like it. It has only replacement option. another disadvantage is it has 15A power code for god knows why. I am not running an AC or motor. No computer desk will have 15A power point. It doesn't have any tilt positions.Picture quality is average not worth the money.Good part:Came in good packaging. And DIY was pretty easy.
4,"This monitor is light weighted, true HD, anti glare and price is also good. The only thing i found missing is No Audio Output. If there will be an audio port where we could connect a speaker it will be super awesome and make ot more useful. Still it is good choice if you are seeking a monitor for safety of your eyes ."
5,"Bought it for WFH, I use as a 2nd bigger screen to project content from my work Laptop and it servers the purpose very well. Will recommend the product."
5,Picture quality is good. It should have 5 ampere plug and not 15 ampere. Also if power backup of couple of hours battery would be great.
4,Seen reviews saying 16A plug  but came with normal plug only.
5,"Ordered with double mind, but quality screen size everything is good .Good for students and people who work from home..Only cons it comes with 15amp plug so had to spend another Rs. 100 to change the plug.."
4,Good monitor... But didn't understand why the 15amp power cord.
4,It has good clearity and good colour production but keep in mind it has big plug of 16 ampere so you have to prepare for it
4,Awesome
5,One of the best products bought from Amazon. Gives Tv like feeling.. No complaints till now.
4,Everything is ok but no auido jack which is very disappointed to me...
5,Delivery was before time and the product came well packed. I purchased it for my home office and its serving the purpose well.
5,Great quality of product
5,Good
4,Value for money
5,Eyes don't get tired even after full day use!! Awesome product of Dell
5,I am using this monitor since more than 2 months now and it's working good.
5,Product is good but the seller isn't good as I got invoice with different serial number which is not good.
4,The power cable is not fitting well on the monitor side
1,The plug is not compatible with my indian plugs
1,The product has come with a power cable not suitable for normal 5A plugs. Making a socket of 15 A for keeping a monitor is somewhat awful
5,बहुत अच्छा है।
5,"It is the best monitor in this budget, very cool to eyes."
2,White seems to be yellow. Not good screen. Dell should work on quality or should scrap this product.
1,Power cable comes with 16A
5,Good Monitor
4,Yelloish White; RGB Colors are not proper even on replacement product.
5,Needed product with both vga and dvi port to work simultaneously. And it does. Great picture quality too.
5,Superb
1,Too much screen bleeding issues

1,Too much screen bleeding issues
5,"If you're the kind of person who is using it for watching movies(especially at night), for casual gaming, and for general purpose usage, this is the best 27"" monitor that you can find under 10kRegarding the VA panel, the colours are punchy, ink-y blacks with zero backlight bleed and viewing angles are decent to good.. I doubt you'll get the same level of blacks and contrast on an IPS panel at this price point let alone 27 inchesAnd yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.Also, this is not colour accurate or HDR compliant nor has HRR but for a general user, these compromises are acceptable for the price you're getting it. Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feebleOverall, I'd recommend this monitor over any other 24"" monitor available at this price category just for the sheer VFM and quality panel that it offersAnd for people thinking about viewing angles as this is not IPS, check out the Lizard pic that I have attached in 3 different angles and trust me, it's not bad and it's definitely a great tradeoff for the deep blacks and zero backlight bleed that it shows head-on which no IPS panel in this price or even 2 levels higher cannot match. Also to note the fact that the monitor will be viewed head-on (+ or - 10 degrees) 95% of the time"
5,"Picture quality is superb, but you have to keep a distance of minimum 3 feet from the display.75Hz on hdmi doesnt seem any different from 60Hz.For continous hours of work, this monitor is perfect.For light gaming, its good.For videos, excellent.I havent tested heavy gaming, so no idea.The images are taken at one finger distance from display.(~3inch)Your eyes wont feel any stress reading/working on this monitor."
1,"Product is very low quality. I received the product on 21April,2021 and it is less than 9days and screen is showing vertical lines.Vertical lines on screen are due to loose connection which do appear after years of usage but within 9days speaks about product quality.Please avoid this product."
5,Fantastic monitor. I went with VA panel as I needed it for watching Netflix. No issues connecting to MacBook. It also works well with Apple TV. Turning off Apple TV puts it in standby mode. Picture quality is nice. I use DCR and the contrast is great. I use it on 60Hz through HDMI port. I couldn’t find 75Hz setting and don’t have VGA cable to test that.
5,The product is amazing. The screen can be customised to your personal preference. It can be wall mounted as it is Vesa capable. I have it mounted on the wall. It is very ergonomic as I can use it for both work and personal use. I am impressed at the monitor for the price. It is definitely value for money. The picture quality is amazing. I mainly wanted a monitor to be mounted on the wall and with my budget this was the only one offering this option.
5,Amazon & seller did a good jobExcellent monitorPicture clarity is greatThis monitor is anti-glareIt wasn't mentioned properly & no one was able to clarify either.60hzIt has AMD free syncI never thought Lenovo monitor will be this great. But it is. And I am happy recommend this to everyone.
4,"Guys I am using this monitor for more than 2 months now. Picture quality is absolutely great considering the price point. Obviously if you are graphic designer/ video editor or gamer then you may need a better refresh rate 4 K monitor, but if you need this for day to day work like WFH and using as secondary screen then go for it. I do watch you tube videos' on this as well no issue so far.3 sides bezel are really very minimal, so yeah its stylish looking monitor.Monitor base is actually bit big so pro is that it will give you monitor a strong base and con is it will take good amount of space at your desk. But for that you can go for any monitor stand.Overall Thumbs up."
5,"I wanted to wait one month before reviewing just to see how well it holds up, so far so good, can't complain for price to performance ratio you are getting what you pay for or even more, i got it in 10k and i would say that it's worth it, i have not tested for gaming but i consume lot of media i have hooked up MI Box and my laptop with Hdmi switch. So far the picture quality and colors are really nice. Worth a buy.."
1,"SUDDENLY FOUND BLACK DISPLAY, never know this is not an onsite warranty, & can't upgrade my warranty. don't buy this. 1st time used Lenovo product, very bad experiencedNow, it's been 42 days I reported to Lenovo, Lenovo keep saying we will replace your product since last 30 days. Will update the review if I get the replacement in this life.Very very post sale services, everyday I'm calling Lenovo."
5,"I had ordered this monitor as an upgrade from my existing 20-inch monitor and woah, 27 inches does make a difference. This monitor is actually good for my usage - the work from home setup that's been going on sometime now (and might go for sometime more too). Look out for the generic Pros & Cons below.Pros:1. Value for Money - this is apparently one of the best monitors for the given price range2. Anti Glare - 100%3. Perfect for WFH setup, app developers, etc.4. Perfect for people who'd like to see their ""Excel"" spreadsheet in wide mode5. Supports high DPI6. Thin Bezels (compared to those old age monitors) - except for the Lenovo branding in the chinCons:1. Really not ideal for gaming - you should look for a Gaming Monitor with higher refresh rates and higher resolution2. Don't get me wrong FHD is all good, but it would be great to have the resolution bumped up to 2K3. There is only one connector supplied (of course a HDMI connector). In case you are upgrading from an older PC, you might need a VDI connector 4. Support is restricted to 60Hz in case of VDI (75Hz is supported only in the HDMI mode)5. Might not be suitable for ""color"" perfect situations - such as designers"
1,"If you are looking for work from home setup, for God's sake please don't buy this product.- Video quality given by 1980 1080 is terrible.I'm basically a game developer. This display quality is never suited for purchase!Bought this today and my eyes have starts paining by sitting for about an hour!Please see to this product from somebody else before buying this."
4,"The display is fine for most users, but it's a little bit dull.Like as if it doesn't have anything modern(IPS, LED, HDR)for online work and data/documents, it'll be fine.But if you're working on anything adobe/design the colors are not accurate.Also, not preferred for movies and pictures as well. Other companies have better-LED monitors at a little more prices."
4,"I wanted to buy a monitor for working from home. i am usually used to having dual monitor setup at office so i was thinking as to what to buy.Then i came across this monitor, for a price of Rs 12000, it sure felt little higher. But after getting the device to home, it is just like a TV and is very easy for me to ditch my laptop completely backside and use this as my only monitor.27inch feels bigger for a couple of days, might also give you mild headache and dryness in eyes.. but once our eyes get used to it, its difficult to go back to small monitors / laptop screens.Performance wise, the display is good, nice viewing angle...Since its VA panel, contrast is much better than IPS panels that i have in other monitors.75Hz makes it little more better, but not much though.It has served me perfect for office work, though 1080p is slightly lower resolution since you can see the pixels also on some scenarios!For gaming i do not know much, since i m not gaming on this, but looks very nice to watch movies as well.Just wanted to have another HDMI port.  now you get 1HDMI + 1VGA...Packaging was nice,  delivery was on time.. so no complaints on that aspect."
5,All things are good in this monitor. But if they also provide inbuilt speakers then it would be too good.This monitor is good for programming with big 27” screen in low budget
5,"I've been using IPS screens for a long time now. I was a bit skeptical before buying this as this is a VA panel. But the product exceeded my expectations in all possible ways.Extreme high brightness, superb contrast, Adequate refresh rate and super thin bezels.I've been working on this for 15 days now and I'm finding it to be really helpful with the larger screen space for multi tasking. Also, I tried CS-GO only to find that this screen is much better than an IPS displays which usually have bad color reproduction and backlight bleeds.The best part is the price. At this price, I think you can't get a better 27 inch screen"
4,The monitor is good and bright enough. Good value for money product. But the black levels are terrible. The blacks look greyish.I expected decent black levels since it is a VA panel. But thats the only caviat. Otherwise the colours look great. The viewing are great for a VA panel. I doubt is it VA or IPS since blacks are terrible and viewing angles are great. And i cant notice pixels in normal distance and iam happy about it. Its sharp and crisp. And there are display controls provided at the right side bottom of the monitor. Thats a plus. Overall value for money product.
1,"The product does what it says,its a cheap 27 inch monitor.The colors are nice,build is pretty sturdy and everything is great,BUT i get terrible headaches from this.Now i don't know if its because of the panels used,or because its 27 inch or some other reason,i cannot use this for more than 30 minutes  without getting horrible headaches.Amazon wont return or replace this,so it pretty much deadweightin my houseAgain the monitor does seem pretty good,and if you think you wont have the problem i mentioned,go for it."
5,After long research I found this product for the budget…after using for 10long days for heavy productivity as my laptop second screen and it works good and best in this budget .the only cons I seen in review is no speaker but which I know and purchased the product so I given 5starAnyway after 3 months I will try to write my updates
5,"I have been using it for work/play since 2 - 3 weeks. Works brilliantly, the screen size makes it easy to read through code and notice issues. Recommended for programming. Also been gaming and watching movies by connecting it to my ps4. Really good experience, image/color production is great for the price. AMD sync seems to be doing an amazing job here with 4ms latency. Only thing i wish was if it had inbuilt speakers, but it does come with a 3.5 mm output, so i connect it to a speaker and use it. So overall very pleased by the product. 5 stars for the size and price."
4,"Value for money. Baught 27"" Lenovo D27-30 monitor at 9999/-. After using it for more than 2 weeks I am happy with the product. The picture quality is good although product quality should have better.Overall it is good monitor at this price to work from home for IT professionals."
3,Actually I thought that it would be small. But its too big for me. Could not visualize whatvthe size would  be. 27” is too big. I reached out to Customer Associate but refused to return. Otherwise product is good
3,Replacement monitor also delivered with 60hz refresh rate.  So quality check not done.
5,"Monitor is excellent for the past one month.  The issue is that, its not comes with VGA cable, only HDMI cable is available.  As, most of the CPU is are not supporting HDMI, u have to buy a GOOD QUALITY VGA cable, else the resolution results in the monitor.  Apart from this everything is good enough."
5,"It maybe Made in China but so are your shoes,car engine parts and probably even your toilet seat...so chill. Its a Fantastic product and the biggest screen you are going to get at 12k, tax included. BUY IT! BLINDLY!"
2,Not apt for gaming or graphics designing. No true colours. Backlight seems high brightness. Just can use as a resource monitor/TV
3,Not the best clarity. It is fine for my day to day job with coding etc. using a hdmi with my laptop the display seems to be a bit hazy.
5,"Im writing this review after 2 months usage. Packing was good. There is 1 HDMI cable , Power cable, monitor in the box. it can be used using VESA mont.i got this 27"" monitor  for 11,999 - which i feel its a great deal. This is perfect use for my WFH. Simply go for it..!!"
4,It's  perfect  for a photographer 😍 it's  helpful for video and her working like accounts it's  build quality  is 👍 and best part is this product is best in this price so i will recommend  to buy this product
4,"Screen is good. Don't have speakers, webcam, mic."
5,Cant find a 27inch monitor for this price. Pretty decent for office work. No speakers included so you may need a separate speakers.
2,Black is not black on this monitor and the colors are not good. Useable only for documentation
1,"Ordered this monitor, but can't use it since the power adapter itself is missing!Have to wait for replacement now"
1,"The power cable ,I think which is very essential was missing, and I was not able to return the screen.Also the corner is of the screen was also damaged."
3,# Resolution is not suitable considering the size of monitor.# suitable for movie and internet browsing.# looks is attractive.** Any horizontal line rotate 5 to 10 degree in AutoCAD application after that this line like stairs step....
5,"First let me answer some of the question you might have.Resolution: 1920X1080Refresh rate: 144Hz with FreesyncCurve: Really curvy!Screen: Matte finishConnections: 2x HDMI 1x DP ports 1x 3.5mm headphone out (i think)The refresh rate makes any experience butter smooth - from browsing to gaming to video editing.Gaming is just crazy immersive with the screen size and curve. I initially wanted to go for a 4k display but the clarity on this is amazing enough, just make you don't mess with the settings unless you know what you're doing or else some features like ""Super Sharpness"" will add sharpness to parallel lines in applications like AutoCAD which will leave you blaming the monitor instead of yourself."
5,"The monitor is very calm on the eyes. Working long does not tire the eyes. The frame refresh rate is good and I am able to obtain close to 144 Hz at 1080p. Being happy with the performance, I am also happy that my Nvidia graphics card's gsync supports the freesync of the monitor and I am getting good performance."
5,"This is my first time investing in a gaming monitor and I did not want to spend silly amount of money on a display, as I primarily game on PS4 pro in my living room on a 49 inch TV.. Due to my recent addiction to COD:Warzone, I felt the need for a higher refresh rate gaming display and ohh boy this screen turned up to the party just right!!Pros:The screen brightness is exceptional!! I have to turn it down to 40-50%.Colour accuracy is good, not the greatest but you can easily fiddle with the settings to your liking.Navigation joystick is the best I've used to tweak settings.Freesynce works perfect with the provided HDMI cable.Solid 144hz refresh rate.1440p feels sooooooo good. Will never go back to 1080p!! It's like viewing the world with prescription glasses on. People with glasses will know what I mean😝Immersive experience with the curved screen.Minimum screen bleed which is visible only in complete darkness. Not visible in daylight.Cons:Build quality is ""OK"" Especially the stand.No USB ports.Curve takes a bit of getting used to.Slight ghosting only while scrolling through text, bit annoying.One bright pixel, only visible in total black blackground. Have to search for it.Investing in a 2k, 144hz gaming monitor does not make you a good gamer.. hahaa 😂Note: I had a weird problem with my JioFiber broadband internet. Speed dropped nearly 90% on 5ghz wifi network after connecting this display to my laptop but worked fine on 2.4ghz frequency. I was really disappointed as I loved the display and was considering to return it. After doing a bit of research, someone recommended to change the frequency channel from my rourter settings as the frequency from the monitor may be messing with my wifi frequency. After changing the channel of my rourter, everything works flawlessly now!!"
4,"Black is a little off , too much backlight when screen is filled majorly by black still cant complain given the budget. except that i am pretty happy with the product. No dp cable comes with the monitor only hdmi is provided so will have to buy that separately. 32inch is really too big if you are using it primarily for computing purpose. having used it now i feel i should have gone for 27inch. even for gaming 27inch or go for 34inch ultrawide rather than this since it is too big. it is awesome to play racing and fifa like games.. but action and shooting games wont be a strong point. Movie watching and media consumption is where it really strikes gold the picture quality is awesome colours are vibrant wouldnt missout on 2k since this monitor more than keep up in video playback. Speakers are just a feature to be listed on description list. I feel even high volume headphone might sound higher than 3W inbuilt speaker..will have to buy an extra speaker or use headphone. The quality of speaker is laughable but i expected that. But the volume level was so low that you couldnt hear even if you sit 1m from monitor."
1,First of all I received an open piece with Seal carefully tampered. With multiple indications that the screen has been touched or used by someone already. Refer screenshots.After carefully opening the package I tried checking the contents with the Checklist. None was missing. My assumption is that someone returned the product which has been directed to me. I still tried assembling the monitor assuming if there is no compromise on quality I have no issue.After assembling I found out that THE FREAKING SPEAKER IS NOT WORKING ON THIS MONITOR.Why the heck do Amazon direct a defective product to prime customers?I got the product delivered in less than 18 hours of booking.Is it like once you received the defective product the delivery team things ...Oh.. Theres another customer who has ordered same monitor.. Lets delivery this defective piece to him.. May be he dosent notice it.. and we shall let him have it..? Is is the thought process of Amazon nowadays?
5,"Excellent for office work. Cannot adjust height so you will have to adjust your chair height, and I also had to use stool for my feet as they no longer touch the ground. It's ok I can buy 400 rupees stool instead of buying another monitor which is 20 more thousand in cost for height adjustment. Got this for 16500 in Deepavali discount sale and Citibank credit card. So it is an excellent buy for me.Building audio with this monitor is joke, don't expect anything."
1,"We ordered a monitor and within 2 weeks it automatically cracked. Spoke to the service department and no reply but to buy another one. We bought another one, and coincidentally even this display of this one cracked automatically within 2 weeks of use. So finally bought another brand."
3,"I am writing a review after 3 months of its use, The volume of the speaker is too low and there is no appropriate option to adjust blue light which is too much impact on my eyes, this having day mode and night mode, in day mode it,s contrast is too high and in night mode its convert in yellow light, I feel which is also hazardous for our eyes than blue light.  while in its product description it's especially highlighted blue light reflection and eye sever mode, but I did not found in real ground picture quality is good and other things are good"
5,"Acer ED322QR (black)- The product details doesn't clarify this but based in monitor settings and AMD Certification, do be advised that this is a FreeSync Premium and not the regular FreeSync model.This is a major plus for the price it is being sold. Apart from that on a budget this is a great VA Panel, does about 270nits, not too bright. The colors aren't so punchy or over saturated, also you need a dp 1.2 cable for the FreeSync Premium to work on Nvidia cards, remember to turn off the vsync while gaming.Also you can install the Acer display widget to control the picture modes, set vsync to specific applications, am not sure what's the use of split screen function though.One negative is that, you need to hold the joystick in the rear for 5 seconds to switch this off (who ever designed this, what were you guys thinking).For 16.5k this is an awesome buy tbh!"
5,"I was using Lenovo G530 for over 5 years now and it was becoming sluggish and erratic after 5 years of use. I am programmer and use the laptop mostly for programming and the Lenovo G530 served me well. I had a Acer 20 inch monitor paired with it and that monitor gave me no issues whatsoever in the last 5 years.  Anyways, I recently upgraded to a new Lenovo laptop Ideapad Gaming 3 equipped with AMD Ryzen 7 4800 H which I bought online from Flipkart and its an amazing machine but when I received the laptop I saw that it did'nt had the old VGA port and only had HDMI port. I got a VGA to HDMI convertor but it did'nt work. I had no option but to get new monitor. I kept on browsing for several days and finally I shortlisted this Acer 32 Inch Full HD Monitor because I used to see huge monitors connected with macs in Apple store so I thought why not I should get a huge monitor too ? After comparing specs , reading countless articles I finally got this one because the price point I got it at was amazing, the size is good, its curved and looks awesome. I don't play games on laptop and don't watch movies etc (apart from short youtube videos) so I really don't care about the ultra clarity from a budget monitor. It was chekcing all the tick marks for me and I got it and I am pretty happy with it. Its working as its expected to. Looks hot when everyone sees it. Costed around 15.5K on amazon, 32 Inch, Full HD, Curved. What else do you want ?"
5,Its a great monitor the only 1 thing you need to remember is the socket  pin is bigger than normal so incase you are wanting to plug this to extension board you will  have to buy an additional 5x15 plug which will cost about 50 to 100 rs. Rest I don't see any cons in this
3,Very low volume.There is no option to slide up/ down.There is no option to swivel sideways.There is no option to tilt to increase/ reduce angle of view.
4,Good Monitor forGaming and VideoMay not be suitable for work.
3,"Only problem is screen dpi, u can sometime see pixels.. if ur not into text work then there is absolutely no issue."
5,Awesome product.Viewing angle is good.And thank you for awesome packaging. Nothing was damaged.
1,Recieved a damaged product! Have placed an replacement order! Lets see how the upcoming product is going to be! Waitng

5,Awesome product.. I love the monitor..
1,Video Player is loading.
5,Perfect in all aspects! Worth it for the price.
5,Simply the best 144hz curved monitor at this price range.
4,blacks are messed up. you actually realise how bad and outdated 1080p is after using this.

5,"If you're the kind of person who is using it for watching movies(especially at night), for casual gaming, and for general purpose usage, this is the best 27"" monitor that you can find under 10kRegarding the VA panel, the colours are punchy, ink-y blacks with zero backlight bleed and viewing angles are decent to good.. I doubt you'll get the same level of blacks and contrast on an IPS panel at this price point let alone 27 inchesAnd yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.Also, this is not colour accurate or HDR compliant nor has HRR but for a general user, these compromises are acceptable for the price you're getting it. Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feebleOverall, I'd recommend this monitor over any other 24"" monitor available at this price category just for the sheer VFM and quality panel that it offersAnd for people thinking about viewing angles as this is not IPS, check out the Lizard pic that I have attached in 3 different angles and trust me, it's not bad and it's definitely a great tradeoff for the deep blacks and zero backlight bleed that it shows head-on which no IPS panel in this price or even 2 levels higher cannot match. Also to note the fact that the monitor will be viewed head-on (+ or - 10 degrees) 95% of the time"
5,"Picture quality is superb, but you have to keep a distance of minimum 3 feet from the display.75Hz on hdmi doesnt seem any different from 60Hz.For continous hours of work, this monitor is perfect.For light gaming, its good.For videos, excellent.I havent tested heavy gaming, so no idea.The images are taken at one finger distance from display.(~3inch)Your eyes wont feel any stress reading/working on this monitor."
1,"Product is very low quality. I received the product on 21April,2021 and it is less than 9days and screen is showing vertical lines.Vertical lines on screen are due to loose connection which do appear after years of usage but within 9days speaks about product quality.Please avoid this product."
5,Fantastic monitor. I went with VA panel as I needed it for watching Netflix. No issues connecting to MacBook. It also works well with Apple TV. Turning off Apple TV puts it in standby mode. Picture quality is nice. I use DCR and the contrast is great. I use it on 60Hz through HDMI port. I couldn’t find 75Hz setting and don’t have VGA cable to test that.
5,The product is amazing. The screen can be customised to your personal preference. It can be wall mounted as it is Vesa capable. I have it mounted on the wall. It is very ergonomic as I can use it for both work and personal use. I am impressed at the monitor for the price. It is definitely value for money. The picture quality is amazing. I mainly wanted a monitor to be mounted on the wall and with my budget this was the only one offering this option.
5,Amazon & seller did a good jobExcellent monitorPicture clarity is greatThis monitor is anti-glareIt wasn't mentioned properly & no one was able to clarify either.60hzIt has AMD free syncI never thought Lenovo monitor will be this great. But it is. And I am happy recommend this to everyone.
4,"Guys I am using this monitor for more than 2 months now. Picture quality is absolutely great considering the price point. Obviously if you are graphic designer/ video editor or gamer then you may need a better refresh rate 4 K monitor, but if you need this for day to day work like WFH and using as secondary screen then go for it. I do watch you tube videos' on this as well no issue so far.3 sides bezel are really very minimal, so yeah its stylish looking monitor.Monitor base is actually bit big so pro is that it will give you monitor a strong base and con is it will take good amount of space at your desk. But for that you can go for any monitor stand.Overall Thumbs up."
5,"I wanted to wait one month before reviewing just to see how well it holds up, so far so good, can't complain for price to performance ratio you are getting what you pay for or even more, i got it in 10k and i would say that it's worth it, i have not tested for gaming but i consume lot of media i have hooked up MI Box and my laptop with Hdmi switch. So far the picture quality and colors are really nice. Worth a buy.."
1,"SUDDENLY FOUND BLACK DISPLAY, never know this is not an onsite warranty, & can't upgrade my warranty. don't buy this. 1st time used Lenovo product, very bad experiencedNow, it's been 42 days I reported to Lenovo, Lenovo keep saying we will replace your product since last 30 days. Will update the review if I get the replacement in this life.Very very post sale services, everyday I'm calling Lenovo."
5,"I had ordered this monitor as an upgrade from my existing 20-inch monitor and woah, 27 inches does make a difference. This monitor is actually good for my usage - the work from home setup that's been going on sometime now (and might go for sometime more too). Look out for the generic Pros & Cons below.Pros:1. Value for Money - this is apparently one of the best monitors for the given price range2. Anti Glare - 100%3. Perfect for WFH setup, app developers, etc.4. Perfect for people who'd like to see their ""Excel"" spreadsheet in wide mode5. Supports high DPI6. Thin Bezels (compared to those old age monitors) - except for the Lenovo branding in the chinCons:1. Really not ideal for gaming - you should look for a Gaming Monitor with higher refresh rates and higher resolution2. Don't get me wrong FHD is all good, but it would be great to have the resolution bumped up to 2K3. There is only one connector supplied (of course a HDMI connector). In case you are upgrading from an older PC, you might need a VDI connector 4. Support is restricted to 60Hz in case of VDI (75Hz is supported only in the HDMI mode)5. Might not be suitable for ""color"" perfect situations - such as designers"
1,"If you are looking for work from home setup, for God's sake please don't buy this product.- Video quality given by 1980 1080 is terrible.I'm basically a game developer. This display quality is never suited for purchase!Bought this today and my eyes have starts paining by sitting for about an hour!Please see to this product from somebody else before buying this."
4,"The display is fine for most users, but it's a little bit dull.Like as if it doesn't have anything modern(IPS, LED, HDR)for online work and data/documents, it'll be fine.But if you're working on anything adobe/design the colors are not accurate.Also, not preferred for movies and pictures as well. Other companies have better-LED monitors at a little more prices."
4,"I wanted to buy a monitor for working from home. i am usually used to having dual monitor setup at office so i was thinking as to what to buy.Then i came across this monitor, for a price of Rs 12000, it sure felt little higher. But after getting the device to home, it is just like a TV and is very easy for me to ditch my laptop completely backside and use this as my only monitor.27inch feels bigger for a couple of days, might also give you mild headache and dryness in eyes.. but once our eyes get used to it, its difficult to go back to small monitors / laptop screens.Performance wise, the display is good, nice viewing angle...Since its VA panel, contrast is much better than IPS panels that i have in other monitors.75Hz makes it little more better, but not much though.It has served me perfect for office work, though 1080p is slightly lower resolution since you can see the pixels also on some scenarios!For gaming i do not know much, since i m not gaming on this, but looks very nice to watch movies as well.Just wanted to have another HDMI port.  now you get 1HDMI + 1VGA...Packaging was nice,  delivery was on time.. so no complaints on that aspect."
5,All things are good in this monitor. But if they also provide inbuilt speakers then it would be too good.This monitor is good for programming with big 27” screen in low budget
5,"I've been using IPS screens for a long time now. I was a bit skeptical before buying this as this is a VA panel. But the product exceeded my expectations in all possible ways.Extreme high brightness, superb contrast, Adequate refresh rate and super thin bezels.I've been working on this for 15 days now and I'm finding it to be really helpful with the larger screen space for multi tasking. Also, I tried CS-GO only to find that this screen is much better than an IPS displays which usually have bad color reproduction and backlight bleeds.The best part is the price. At this price, I think you can't get a better 27 inch screen"
4,The monitor is good and bright enough. Good value for money product. But the black levels are terrible. The blacks look greyish.I expected decent black levels since it is a VA panel. But thats the only caviat. Otherwise the colours look great. The viewing are great for a VA panel. I doubt is it VA or IPS since blacks are terrible and viewing angles are great. And i cant notice pixels in normal distance and iam happy about it. Its sharp and crisp. And there are display controls provided at the right side bottom of the monitor. Thats a plus. Overall value for money product.
1,"The product does what it says,its a cheap 27 inch monitor.The colors are nice,build is pretty sturdy and everything is great,BUT i get terrible headaches from this.Now i don't know if its because of the panels used,or because its 27 inch or some other reason,i cannot use this for more than 30 minutes  without getting horrible headaches.Amazon wont return or replace this,so it pretty much deadweightin my houseAgain the monitor does seem pretty good,and if you think you wont have the problem i mentioned,go for it."
5,After long research I found this product for the budget…after using for 10long days for heavy productivity as my laptop second screen and it works good and best in this budget .the only cons I seen in review is no speaker but which I know and purchased the product so I given 5starAnyway after 3 months I will try to write my updates
5,"I have been using it for work/play since 2 - 3 weeks. Works brilliantly, the screen size makes it easy to read through code and notice issues. Recommended for programming. Also been gaming and watching movies by connecting it to my ps4. Really good experience, image/color production is great for the price. AMD sync seems to be doing an amazing job here with 4ms latency. Only thing i wish was if it had inbuilt speakers, but it does come with a 3.5 mm output, so i connect it to a speaker and use it. So overall very pleased by the product. 5 stars for the size and price."
4,"Value for money. Baught 27"" Lenovo D27-30 monitor at 9999/-. After using it for more than 2 weeks I am happy with the product. The picture quality is good although product quality should have better.Overall it is good monitor at this price to work from home for IT professionals."
3,Actually I thought that it would be small. But its too big for me. Could not visualize whatvthe size would  be. 27” is too big. I reached out to Customer Associate but refused to return. Otherwise product is good
3,Replacement monitor also delivered with 60hz refresh rate.  So quality check not done.
5,"Monitor is excellent for the past one month.  The issue is that, its not comes with VGA cable, only HDMI cable is available.  As, most of the CPU is are not supporting HDMI, u have to buy a GOOD QUALITY VGA cable, else the resolution results in the monitor.  Apart from this everything is good enough."
5,"It maybe Made in China but so are your shoes,car engine parts and probably even your toilet seat...so chill. Its a Fantastic product and the biggest screen you are going to get at 12k, tax included. BUY IT! BLINDLY!"
2,Not apt for gaming or graphics designing. No true colours. Backlight seems high brightness. Just can use as a resource monitor/TV
3,Not the best clarity. It is fine for my day to day job with coding etc. using a hdmi with my laptop the display seems to be a bit hazy.
5,"Im writing this review after 2 months usage. Packing was good. There is 1 HDMI cable , Power cable, monitor in the box. it can be used using VESA mont.i got this 27"" monitor  for 11,999 - which i feel its a great deal. This is perfect use for my WFH. Simply go for it..!!"
4,It's  perfect  for a photographer 😍 it's  helpful for video and her working like accounts it's  build quality  is 👍 and best part is this product is best in this price so i will recommend  to buy this product
4,"Screen is good. Don't have speakers, webcam, mic."
5,Cant find a 27inch monitor for this price. Pretty decent for office work. No speakers included so you may need a separate speakers.
2,Black is not black on this monitor and the colors are not good. Useable only for documentation
1,"Ordered this monitor, but can't use it since the power adapter itself is missing!Have to wait for replacement now"
1,"The power cable ,I think which is very essential was missing, and I was not able to return the screen.Also the corner is of the screen was also damaged."
2,Screen bleeding is a major flaw. Both ordered and replaced product had this issue so returned it for refund.I suggest buy from local shop and check for bleeding before buying it.I bought a Samsung monitor from local shop which is 1.5k expensive but checked for bleeding issue before paying for it and also stand is more sturdy.But it also depends on your requirement and if your eyes can tolerate bleeding then you can go ahead with this product. For me it’s very annoying.There are people who believe that bleeding is a normal thing but trust me it’s a design flaw or damage product.For me paying so much money for a defective product gives no satisfaction rather pay a bit more and get a good product.Only take away from my review is that don’t settle for a monitor having screen bleeding even if it is minor.
5,"First of all, don’t mind the reviews about screen bleed issues reported, either they have got a defect batch or expecting too much from a 24inch monitor worth 8K. Has it got screen bleed? Only if you are looking for it, that too in completely black screen, nothing disturbing of that sort. If you’re looking for exceptional viewing experience spend more and buy an advanced monitor. With this monitor you get what you pay for and some.When I was booking the monitor there was deal of the day happening and the price was 8100 and when I ordered I got an instant bank discount of 800rs, so I got the monitor for 7300, which is a killer deal for this monitor.Coming to the package, it was really well packed, monitor was completely protected by thermocol and packed inside one. Very good packing. Mounting the monitor was just plug and play matter. No height adjustment. You get HDMI and VGA cable with it, I connected through HDMI cable, that should give a better viewing experience if you have got a good GPU. Power adaptor is also of good quality.I was using AOC 19inch monitor before and this sure is a big monitor and will get some getting used to. HD videos are splendid and games play rather well on this screen, this is not a gaming monitor, but for what you paid, you won’t be complaining.I did a monitor screen test online and this monitor passed the test with flying colours.Extremely happy with my purchase and I will update if any issue crops up."
4,"This is the best 75hz 1080p ips budget panel for now,But there is just one flaw that made me give this product a 4 star instead of 5, and that is the screen bleed,If you buy this monitor for more media consumption than gaming, you will definitely notice the screen bleed happening in this monitor and you can't do anything because it's an lcd panel.If you don't mind it then it's for if you're on a tight budget."
3,"I returned the monitor because of annoying backlight bleed of display but the replaced monitor was same issue. My first purchased monitor imported date was june 2020 and second one was april 2020 that means different production batch, but the same bleeding issue found. This is a series manufacturing defect I think.. may be I am more sensitive to light bleeding. But my old samsung monitor doesn't have this issue, still working....Pros: *Natural/realistic colour reproduction* trending new design* A+ grade energy star certified* Value for moneyCons: Noticeable screen Backlight bleed"
5,"Got this monitor for Rs.8300/- with amazon instant discount, Not gaming segment monitor but got it all. 1080p 75hz,IPS panel,AMD Freesync. No Complain."
5,Didn't have lot of expectation when I bought it. It was supposed to be my secondary monitor. But after using it for few days. I must say I am totally impressed and satisfied. Very soothing on eyes for long hour working and pretty decent for gaming.
4,Video Player is loading.
5,The borderless finish is really impressive.I would say it to be the best product in this price range... As an IPS panel users may feel a bit of whitenning type of view comparing to a TN panel... I also purchased a same sized Dell IPS monitor of higher price & I didn't feel any difference between the picture quality...
5,"Best 75hz IPS display 1080p monitor at 8.5k budget.I was bit skeptical when I planned to buy this. But, then I compared lot others like LG, ACER,SAMSUNG then concluded with this.Believe me if I say this.. It's awesome. 🥰Vivid displaySharp tones of brightness and contrast.Bezel lessAdded bonus - If you are looking for a vesa mount monitor this will look epic.Just buy it.! 😇"
5,"Very good display.. whole body of the monitor is plastic but no complaints ""a value for money product""."
1,"I had high expectations from AOC and without any doubt I placed an order and got delivered within a day, thanks to AmazonHowever when I plugged in with my system I was disappointed what I saw -Screen bleeds everywhere for dark and grey backgroundsScreen bleeds becomes more prominent and annoying under low light.Placed return right away."
1,Never ever buy this product - No value for money. Worst product ever used as Monitor - There is no sharpness and clarity - especially the text appears weird on the screen. It causes discomfort while looking at the screen as the display is distorted.Another reason not to buy is that they offer only replacement and no return - one can imagine the trauma if you cannot return and buy another one.
5,"Best monitor in this price range, Am using it as external monitor for my laptop.. no bleeding or any issue detected in my piece by gods grace. Thanks to appario retail & Amazon ..."
5,Picture quality is excellent. Eyes will not strain even after using continuously for 10-12 hours of usage. Right choice for CAD applications. Base plate could have been metal/aluminium reinforcement. Overall very good FHD monitor.
4,WRITING THIS AFTER 3 DAYS OF BUYING ✌️👍It has a screen bleeding issues ... But It's Looks only when black Background on screenPicture Quality AwesomeWall MountableHDMID.SUB... GOT IT IN BIG BILLION DAYS 8200 RUPEESSIDE FITTING IS NOT WELL ... BUT ITS NEGOTIABLE ... BUY IT ... IT WILL NEVER DISAPPOINT U
5,Just go for it in this price range. Picture quality is good. Also have sRGB and many mode for adjustment.AOC known for Monitors and did the job done.You barely get 24inch ips with 75hz monitor and also give two cables HDMI and VGA.I compaired alot and got it. And I'm satisfied for this purchase under 8.5k.😀
5,"Value for money 200percent very good just go for it if you are going to buy a monitor under 10k the best one is this , i am very happy with this product display was amazing , better than my hp laptop really my phone not got photo clearly but monitor was amazing"
5,Best monitor at this price range and you can feel the difference between 60 and 75 hz if you have the eyes for it
5,I bought it for 7100 after using coupon and Amazon pay credit card.Picture quality is good. It takes little bit of time to get used to such a big moniter.As a programmer POV they screen size adds more space to work on. Recommended for people having budget under 8K-10 K
4,No speakers available. But picture quality is good.
5,"Every thing is goodLow cost 24"" best budget monitor."
4,Only one problem that i found is screen bleed. Picture quality is good. Average TFT...
2,Backlight bleeding just go and buy some other monitor.. inside bookelt also not provided correctly.. waste of money
5,It's really good and met my expectation.
5,Its Awsome
5,Comes with both HDMI and VGA cables.
5,Wonderful for this price. Great picture quality. Blue light filter is available
5,Picture quality is nice. Default contrast value is 50 but have to reduce it if room is dark. Contrast and brightness can be further enhanced by using the bright frame.
4,Not the best build or picture quality. Can do better in this range with other monitors on discount.
5,Full hd and excellent panel quality...
1,Only giving 5 star to appear on top.Only monitor was delivered. Misleading discription too it just has VGA port no HDMI provision. And as mentioned in title big beast fast charge data cable is not provided too.Amazon should not allow such misleading vendors. Very bad for such a brand
1,"The product that I ordered never worked. I guess it was a defective  product. I was hoping that there would be a customer care number or some helpline which would help in sorting the issue. But, alas that too was not available !!!"
4,"No HDMI cable, no HDMI port available. No free cable available."
1,See how the new monitor is working and then order please
1,Bad quality screen view. Please replace or refund
5,Using with desktop. Good
4,Very good
1,Worst
1,HDMI cable not provided but mentioned
5,Got the monitor from oceans trade company and the packing is good .. Received new product and hdmi cable was inside the box as mentioned.... I dnt know about others and their bad review from my point of view for this price we get 720p HD monitor ... I connected through hdmi and the display is so good and vibrant.. Also the picture and video is sharp played 1080p vids.. The only drawback is the price rs.3800 original price before covid 2900rs.
1,Don't but this product. They will first send you old used and defective  screen. Then you will have to get it replaced. Even if you by any chance get a good piece the picture quality etc is poor.
3,"I just received the product yesterday, it's worth buying for this amount, I bought it as screen extender from my laptop it's light and easy to store. Please note that this screen is not HD or support s 4k, it best for work purpose not for movies/vedio editing etc."
1,Vary vary bad product. Screen break don't buy ..please blacklist that seller from everywhere
5,What a purchase..Best monitor for 720 p gaming...But you can get vga or hdmi it's random.
5,"Nice packing, and very fast delivered before date..."
3,Great product 1280px rate...Best in price for cctv usage...Would suggest dnt buy if wanna use for video viewing rather than cctv
3,"It's okay, not very good quality but yes not bad also average"
3,Not good but average of price
1,Display Quality not Good
1,Received Broken/Danaged
5,good
1,Does not work
1,The product was shipped defective with internal issues . Don not order from this seller .
5,Nice picture quality and brightness. Worth for money
1,The product was not good and it was damaged
3,Good monitorBest for low budget pc.
5,cctv monitor
1,Very bad quality
5,This price is good productFor basic work this is valu for moneyI recommend for normal work this product
5,It really good for work. When I have buy this monitor their was no review of this product. So i get nervous but still I go for it with product. Becoz it's less in price thats enough after purchasing and getting this product by looking the package i get relief it was perfect packing so it wont get destroy the monitor. After using this product i recommend everyone to use this product might be it brand that's not sound well but use it you will get belief yaa that it's product to everyone of u.
4,"First thing I noticed is this: I was able to use it with higher resolution than the specified resolution.( Specified resolution is 1280 x 800. I was able to use this monitor in 1680x1050 @ 60Hz )Many colors will disappear if you change the brightness from standard factory settings.But, in factory settings, it looks good and worth for the money.There was visible brightness difference between two corners of the screen for the piece I bought. So I applied for replacement .In short, I like this light weight, low-power, relatively higher resolution monitor with HDMI for this price."
4,"Good monitor, works perfectly.There were two or three dead pixel spots that missed their quality control. Else works well"
5,Good one for the price only con is can't go uhd resolution no problem I only use 720p but it can go further than that...
4,Very sleek and slim. Indeed a very good Monitor!
3,Not good
5,Good quality monitor. Hdmi cable provided.
5,"I'm a full time Developer and I needed a bigger screen because staring at small texts all day long on a 15inch screen is not good enough and it strains my eyes.Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.Not only for programmers, if you a media consumer then this is a great choice at this price.You should go for this product."
2,"Pixelated text and fonts cause headache while working or browsing. The system settings and menu is also pixelated, so it's not the issue with specific operating system. I tried connecting with windows, linux and Mac but pixelated overall appearance in all. HD videos appear good, without issues but I mostly work with text while coding and browsing, so it's waste of money for me. I trusted LG after reading lot of good reviews but no-one pointed this pixelation and blurry text/fonts issue. I hope my review helps others to make informed choice"
1,I was misguided to buy it saying it's made in india. Once I received it I got to know its actual china made. Had it keep it as it was not returnable.  Amazon please mention where the product is made.
1,"The MRP as per the product detail is Rs.18,000. The MRP affixed on the carton of the monitor is Rs.13,900. which is less the price actually charged in the website Rs.13,999. The Snap of MRP sticker on the carton of the monitor is attached."
4,"The overall picture quality is quite good. Look and feel of the monitor is also good. It has a good level of brightness and contrast range. I use it for my job and spend more than 10 hours per day using it. But I don't feel any strain on my eyes. The height of the stand is perfect for me.However, there are two issues:1. There is some light bleeding (see photo)2. Speaker quality is very badAlthough I didn't expect the speakers to be of great quality, it still disappointed me for how bad they sound.But it has an audio port, so it should be ok. I haven't tried the audio port sound though.If you are ok with these two issues, you can go ahead with this one."
5,Colors are very accurate!I can also adjust the sharpness which will make things even sharper and clear.:::VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:::To get the best Picture experience you have to change some of the settings. As the factory settings are verybad-Keep the contrast to 50 and brightness to 80 or 90-Keep the BLACK level to LOW OR OFF this will give you a washed out effect if you keep it High don't use it.-Set the Picture Quality to WarmCheck the 2nd pic for more info try to keep it same as mine.
4,"I had done quite a research before I bought this monitor and if you believe me this is the best monitor in this price range...Cost varies from 11K to 11.5K, features and design are obviously mentioned in the product description and each of them stands true.The speakers are good. I checked and there is no backlight bleed in my monitor...The look kills it and it's worth every penny you buy it for..."
2,"I just bought this monitor, and I know that this can run at 75hz of refresh rate, so I changed the refresh rate to the 75hz, and then I saw these wired green lines and screen trearing thing this only happened when I am running the monitor in 75hz settings, and when I dropped the refresh rate to again 60hz it becomes normal, and there will be no issues then, I am using it with my i3, 8th gen Lenovo Laptop with no dedicated GPU. I don't know why this is happening, maybe my monitor has some issues, if anyone is facing the same issue, please reply or otherwise I have to replace this one."
5,"Its a good monitor which uses IPS panel, so colors are accurate and viewing angle is good. Refresh rate is 75hz, but its 60hz out of the box, you would need to set it up to work at 75hz. I mainly use it as a second screen with my laptop for web development, but have tested games like Call of duty Warzone and CSGO. Sadly, none of them reach 60hz on my laptop. Upgrade from 60hz to 75hz does not feel significant otherwise in day to day computing. If gaming is the only purpose and you have GPU that can push games to 100 FPS or more, then 75hz display will be a bottleneck. Look for 144hz."
1,Backlight bleeding issue worst display
5,As LG is the main player in the field of displays and this time too I was not disappointed. It is a good monitor for both developers and gamers. We have an option for fine-tuning the settings for the monitor and there is also an out for speakers.
1,Ordered 1st one that have a horrible backlight bleeding and there is a gap between the panel and frame at the bottom right corner got replacement with another one and this have a opening at the top the panel is not glued properly light is leaking from the gaps at the top and this too have a backlight bleeding at top and bottom which is easily noticeable when screen gets dark
5,COLOUR ARE TOO GOOD TO LOOK ON THIS MONITOR WITHOUT ANY BACKLIGHT BLEEDING.
1,I have not used it so far but I am giving rating just because it's not 24 inch. It is 21 inch monitor to which company is claiming of 24 inch.
1,"My monitor has fog like stains(the monitor is just 3+ month old it had it from start but it was not that visible at the start), and the panel is to be replaced, today is 21st day after I complained to LG service the technician came 2 times 1st time he documented took pictures of the problem and made the request for the panel after 10 days when I called customer service again they gave me 2 phone numbers to call both of them did not pick up even after calling 5+ times, after calling to customer service they sent the same technician to open and take pictures of the panel and now when I called them yesterday(20th day) they said your request is cancelled then they said it's open they said some senior will call me yes they called and said they will coordinate with me and the technician, now its been 24 hours the same thing happened and they are playing possum again, I complained to head of customer service in India or something and registered my grievance online, my lg tv which was not in warranty was repaired just in 2 days paid 5k the monitor is in warranty, this is how LG works carelessness everywhere they wont extend the warantee so u have to just shut up and bear with them even if its your loss"
4,"If you want a 24 inch IPS display (measure screen diagonally ie. BottomLeft corner to TopRight corner) for entertainment like watching movies and serials etc, graphic work like Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator etc and also want to play FPS games (4ms ResponseTime, 1ms MBR, 75hz) like CSGO and PUBG and have a Rs10,000 budget then this is the screen for you.The delivery came in a double carton packaging...when you open a gift box and there is another smaller box inside the gift box..ya this amazon delivery packaging was something like that...the inside box was the original LG carton...i received a factory sealed brand new LG 24"" monitor.. assembled monitor stand, attached power and hdmi cables and changed Monitor Settings Screen Refresh Rate to 75hz (RightClickMouse> ScreenResolution> Advanced settings> Monitor> MonitorSettings ..change.. ScreenRefreshRate to 75Hertz) ..That's it and you are done. (If you using Nvidia then one more setting should be done: Open Nvidia ControlPanel..then under Manage3D Settings, Background Application Max Frame Rate, sellect ON and keep at 75 FPS...this will help screen tearing and playing games will be smooth..also suggest to keep V-Sync ON)If I am asked whether there is anything that I didn't like about the monitor I'll say everything about it is just great and thanks to LG..However if I'm told to find 3 faults on this particular LG monitor and that my life depends on it; then and only then I'd point out these three CONS:1. Even though Stand is wide, grippy and looks to be made of very high quality material and holds screen firmly anchored on the table...the screen is kinda wobbly on a RicketyTable..(like a bobblehead toy-figure on a cars dashboard: the figurine does not move or fall but the head is constantly wobbling) but do not fear my lads the built quality of this LG monitor is made of good quality material and look is SOLID.2. The sound is different..volume is loud and clear but something about it is wierdly different..no equalisers in settings only some MaxxAudio but enabling it made audio kinda hollow sounding so may have to twerk PC software equaliser settings.3. The HDMI cable plugs horizontally at the back so it protrudes defeating the very purpose of slim design and I wonder how someone can wall mount this screen.[Note: If you want to buy screen primarily for gaming CSGO, PUBG etc then suggest you to read difference between TN and IPS panel; TN panels have a better response time while IPS panels have better viewing angles and color reproduction.. my brother went for a 24"" ASUS brand TN panel monitor and it's ResponseTime is 0.5ms having 165hz and the difference in advantage is huge nearly cheating types but the problem is the screen is very dull looking so not much fun while doing graphic work and watching movies etc]"
1,I hereby want to declare for the welfare of my fellow amazon customers that this product that I am writing review of comes with free dead pixels and bright pixels however the quantity of each is determined on how lucky you are till now I have replaced one monitor first one had SIX DEAD PIXELS and now to my amazement second one has 4 DEAD PIXELS and 1 BRIGHT PIXEL and 2 STUCK PIXELS so if you are bored in quarantine and have spare time to replace this product repeatedly then please buy.
5,"I did my extensive research and this is one of the Finest 24 inches Monitors out there on Amazon.Design : 9/10Bootup speed : 9/10Features : 9/10Inbuilt audio : 7/10 ( There is no Bass, just like normal computer speakers, but this is what is expected from a monitor)Picture Quality : 9/10 ( Best for an IPS display with Full HD resolution)If you want to buy a monitor bigger than this , go with 4K resolution. With Full HD the max screensize you can look for is 24"" inches.Got this Beauty around 11K.Either watching movie, doing WFH or gaming, It works like a charm.NOTE : Height is not adjustable, you can only tilt the monitor screen as per your viewing angle."
5,"Using this for office work. It's a great monitor for my purpose.Only problem I see is its ""Made in China"". If I had realised this, I would have opted for something else"
1,"(EDIT: As many reviewers have noted, there's a dead pixel issue appearing now after 2 months of use. Disappointed as return is no longer possible!)First monitor I've purchased. Extremely happy with it, using it as a secondary display for ease of WFH.Easy to install but feels a bit flimsy on the thin stand. Liked that there are 2 HDMI ports, for multi-purpose use (laptop + Chromecast). The matte screen + multiple screen viewing mode options make it easy on the eyes. Thin bezel is a bonus, picture quality is top notch."
4,"I bought this product on 25th and recieved it on 28th.delivery was decent.i used it for 3 days and writting my initial impressions.1.Why i bought this monitor?I needed a monitor for my video editing and web development.my main concern was colors and contrast of the display.I could only spend 15000 or less. so i looked for an ips display between 22 and 24 inch.And this was the best option for me.And i am not a gamer so the response time was more than enough gor me.NOTE: if gaming isn't your priority, avoid gaming monitors at all cost. Their colors are very pale and flat.2. What is my experience with it?The monitor is wide enough and stands on the surface decently.It has a little bit of wobble(monitor shakes if surface moved)but not that it bothers you.its minor.The colors are crisp and sharp.looking great while editing.99 percent srgb.great display.3. Color calibration.In the product description it says that this monitor is factory calibrated but it was looking like some low quality TN panel when it came out of box.It took me 20 mins to calibrate the monitor with good colors. after calibration it was looking awesome.You can calibrate as per your needs.here is the settings i use.Brightness 70 percent.Sharpness 40 percentContrast 70 percentGama mode 3Temperature is best at cool. But you can also set it at medium if you are uncomfortable with some extra bluelight.4.Build quality.The monitor is sturdy and robust.white finish was awesome.ports are working fine.i tested it for 2 hours for dead pixels,backlit bleeding,ips glow,pixelization,rendering and resolution.I have to say that it performed decently in every test.few issues.1.Little backlit bleeding on top right.2.ON SCREEN CONTROL is not supporting on this monitor.i downloaded the specific software from LG website allocated for this particular model.But its not supporting.i had to use bottom button for calibration and it took me ages to finish.3.if your are not habbituated with big displays your eyes may hurt a little at early stages but its ok. 2.5 feet distance recommended.4. The stand could have been more stable.5. Bottom bezzel.Most importantly, the bottom bezzel was not glued to the display properly.the screen was going inside while touching on the bottom screen.There is a 0.5cm gap between screen and bottom bezzel.i have to find the nearest lg service center to get it fixed.Other than these issues this is a great monitor at this price.you should definately check it out."
5,"Got the monitor for approx. 6000 during the sale. Replaced once (Details afterwards). Amazon sent me a used monitor, really disappointed at it. Even the invoice of the other person was there in the box.I ordered the 22 inch model because honestly there is no use of having a 24 inch monitor in Full HD resolution, it needs more resolution to get better ppi. The display quality of the monitor is excellent at the price range (even through VGA port). Color reproduction is very good & viewing angles are great too.3-side (top, left & right) bezels are quite thin & the bottom bezel is also of negligible thickness with LG branding. Overall thickness of the monitor is also quite less & aesthetically looks good with the curved stand.Navigating the monitor menu is easy with the joystick button provided at the bottom of the monitor.Now coming to the only flaw this monitor has, which basically is a flaw with the IPS technology. The monitor i received first had some yellow tint on the lower left corner of the screen (& quite negligible on the upper left & right corners) when viewing straight & increased/decreased on changing viewing angles & was only noticeably visible in dark backgrounds or playing games with dark scenes in a dim lit room. After research on the internet i found out that it was 'IPS Glow'. Do not confuse 'IPS Glow' with 'Backlight Bleeding', these are 2 different things. Backlight bleed doesn't change when viewing at an angle.After discussing with Amazon i replaced my monitor in hope of getting a piece with less of the IPS glow, but unfortunately faced the same with the new monitor too.This is the case with all IPS monitors, even high end ones. Low manufacturing quality i would say by all the companies. It's just a gamble that you will get a monitor with less or negligible IPS Glow. You can do things to lessen the effect of IPS glow virtually like, having ambient light around the monitor, low brightness, tilting the monitor as per your seating height or just use the monitor in well lit environment if you can. Moreover, IPS monitors are usually considered best for Multimedia purposes like photo/video editing, for which this monitor is a perfect fit.I use the monitor with my PS4 also & i would say the games look great But if you are a hardcore gamer, go for TN panel monitors. If you are looking for a mid-ground mixture of IPS & TN panel, then go for VA panel monitors.Overall, the monitor is perfect for average users with regular PC work, Multimedia usage, casual gaming (both PC-75hz & PS4-60hz) etc."
4,"I bough this in June for my WFH and using it since then. I am a software developer and use this with my Macbook Pro, Dell Vostro 3568 and Dell Precision 7540 and even my RaspberryPi.PICTURE QUALITY 3.5/5Picture quality is quite good for watching videos which are crystal clear. It is also quite good with editors in dark theme mode. Great while using VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA in dark mode. But not good at all with text in white background like in browsers. In white background, text is pixelated and you can see pixel dots which can cause headache. Had to change resolution to 1920x1080 manually in Dell 3568 as it defaults to 1366x768 which gave better picture. Other devices were by default in FullHD so no problem. Those who calling it OLED likeis only when you watch videos.COLOR 4/5Color is very good. I didn't have any backlight bleeding. Still I felt black could have been better considering its price. Black is better than Dell 3568 but not so good like Mac or Precision 7540.BRIGHTNESS 5/5Extremely bright. I had to reduce it to just 20.ANTI-GLARE 5/5Matt finish is awesome. No reflection and pain in eyes.DESIGN 2/53 side bezel less design gives an amazing look. Knew it can't be tilted vertically, but this one can hardly be titlted horizontally."
1,"You know, amazon service!Sometimes it makes your day, and at times the hell of a nightmare you wouldn't wanna remember again.A story, I'm sharing with you, This happened to me on the day the product arrived. I never thought it would take the shape of the service, I would have never imagined. Trust me, you have to!I received the unit, checked it, was running fine. You know, the happiness remains for short period, same goes here.I started seeing black pictures while switching screens and color gets inaccurate at times. Fine what's the big deal. Amazon backs us, that's what my foolish brain was simulating. When I tried doing replacement. Wow, you hear the toxic words, ""I'm sorry Sir, I'm really sorry"". That's all the their training focuses on. I'm speaking from experience, man!.But after several attempts, it was finally a replacement, even though I wanted to get a refund, cuz I hate the product and service. No they will only allow replacement. Fine!I'll give another try, I convinced my foolish brain. Now when the unit came it the first groundshaking day for me. The Holy Serial Number Verification Mismatch Nightmare. The unit was rejected by delivery boy and he was kind enough to let me take screenshot of his screen. The same repeated again on the second day when the delivery boy lost hope rejected delivery. Cuz he gets 20RS a packet and he would wait for 1hr, he'll lose his income cuz of amazon's great service.Again I tried talking to the amazon agent for resolution, she said another set of scary words ""Don't worry Sir"". Yea I was a person who believes easily, so I believed it. She had arranged for a return, well I thought it'll be picked up like usual. The disaster happened with me again. I was stunned. Called amazon again.I was frightened to hear the same scary words again ""Please don't worry sir"". I knew I'm drowning, so can't  lose hope. So I thought let's try again. Same thing repeated in total 5 times. This is me writing in frustration and making you aware of what amazon service terror looks like for some products.I don't know what'll happen, I've been given a date of 17Oct, 2021 for pickup without any questions asked. I'll update on the same day. Hope my story won't be yours anyday. Ganbatte!!"
1,Wrost products got damage piece and when I call to the customer service they made my replacement request but no one come it's 9 day from the date of odering what a normal person can do for this . This is insane I don't expect this type of service from amazon whenever I call them they say tomorrow the person will come between 7 to 7 I ask for the no. They say he will contact you .no specific time on the return window what can one do they say same thing everytime I call them . Pls amazon it's an humble request help us.
5,"Picture quality is great as colors are nicely calibrated. The speakers are standard and not extraordinary. But as the speakers are downward facing, it enhances the surround effect. Flicker free technology helps in reducing eye strain. The stand is made of metal and is sturdy. There is no backlight bleeding in this unit."
1,Dead pixel on a new monitor is the worst experience
4,"display quality is good and everything is as u expect it to be but the built quality of the frame and the body is not that goodand the display panel wobbles a lot.I was using a dell fhd tn monitor before this and in comparison the so called ""IPS"" display, colors and the viewing angles are only slightly better.i guess it was my fault for expecting too much because this is my first ips diplay but still. and again as i said the build quality is not what i was expecting from a big brand like LG.The display also has backlight bleeding which is normal for ips monitors to be honest.i got this display for 9000 and in my opinion this display is not worth more than 7000-7500."

5,"Bought it to use  both as a work monitor and also for entertainment, the color production is excellent, no led bleeding and it has two 5 watt speakers which are good enough to meet your requirement without creating wire clutter for a set of speakers!  Comes with Vesa mount and two hdmi ports, which are again very useful features."
1,"Don't buy this monitor and make a mistake like me. Go for the benq instead.Cons:-1) The text is pixelated even if you are at 2 feet away from monitor.2) Brightness is too high even at 30%. At 0% there is minimal dimming, behaves like 40% brightness of benq monitor. This strains the eyes if you game for prolonged sessions or work in night shifts.3) 75Hz refresh rate is not noticeable like 120 or 144Hz.4) Very high IPS glow.Pros:-1) The color reproduction in this panel is very good compared to my VA gaming monitor.2) No back light bleeding (but the ips glow is always there and it's too high)"
5,Cheez toh mast hai picture quality bhi badhiya hai .maine isko 7000 mein purchase kiya tha abhi 11000 hai yeh kya bakaiti hai .agar yah price mein bolu toh bhai utne mein 24 inch aajayega . It is not worth more than 8000. Agar yah tak milta hai toh lelo warna offline aram se mil jayega.
4,"Good monitor. Display quality is the best part. Stance is gorgeous. Two HDMI ports is a nice feature as I can switch between two laptops whenever I want without the need to unplug hdmi cable from one and connecting to other. (Note: it comes with only one HDMI cable as expected). Presets of picture modes helpful though there isn't an option to customize over them like on a tv set. For example reader mode is good but feels quite bright and, there is no way I can adjust it. Overall excellent purchase. LG scores very high on displays; be it TV or monitors. Met my expectations. It is a great addition to ease my work from home."
5,"I was looking for a mid range monitor, specifically, did not want to buy a bigger one as i had already one.I was also looking for monitor other than DELL, was got LG.Power cord is very slim and does not occupy much space which helps save space and clean is also easier...Thanks for such a sleek monitor and set was way to easy.Writing review after 15 days of purchase."
4,Pros:1) Good picture quality2) One single Joystick button for all monitor settings3) LG app to use features i.e split screen4) very good quality power adapter of 5A (while most other have heavy 15A big sockets)5) borderless design6) Okiesh speakers3) 2 HDMI Ports4) Audio out portCons:1) Okiesh speakers2) Only front/ backwards tilt & not up down hight adjustable3) No USB Port4) Does not switch bw HDMI inputs ( in case only one is powered ON)
4,"Overall a good monitor. Looks wise the wallpapers and videos looks good with the matte finish surface.Text are clear and blacks are deep not Oled deep but yeah. Borders are thin but not thin like LG 24mp88hv.Stand is sturdy and only vertical tilt adjustment is there. If not satisfied, support for vesa mount is there.No pixel bleeding was seen.Although the setting for 1ms motion blur reduction is not working for me but still no difference as i use it for mostly my office work.Got it for 15,458/-.Speakers are average as expected, no bass if you are expecting that.My rating: 7/10 for this monitor. Worth for your penny."
4,"Meets all my requirement for a monitor for Home and Office use. Good picture and build quality. Good looking too. Its light weight too. The stand is elegant but not sufficient. I never intended to use the stand either. I will get a swivel arm to mount the monitor. Using HDMI, we can set up 1920x1080 at 75 Hz frame refresh rate. HDMI cable included in the box but is not very lengthy for my purpose. It has two HDMI ports. Not sure why. Need to explore that aspect."
1,"The package was good but the product was poor quality. Maybe seller is selling only the defective items from LG. The first monitor I got had black spots on the middle of the display but thanks to Amazon, they replaced my monitor with second one, which has BACK LIGHT DIMMING issue on the BOTH LOWER CORNERS of the DISPLAY. Instead of replacing they told me to refund, but after much thinking I thought of keeping that defective item. Now I have to live with it for at least 5 years. :( Awful experience for me!!!If display quality is your primary concern please buy at your own risk."
4,"Since all the reviews are clubbed here for the various variants of this monitor, this review is for 22MK600M (Black). This model is one of the most recent models. The screen is good. Has AMD sync (works only with AMD processors not intel). Comes with an HDMI Cable, Power Cord & Table Stand.Note: This variant DOES NOT have the inbuilt LG screen-split software. One can use freeware software of the Windows 10 inbuilt split screen feature should suffice.The build is pretty decent given the price point (personally it felt little weak on the non bezel less ends, but nothing to worry). Screen tilt by certain degrees is possible.Over recommend this monitor given the price point, value for moneyThere are 2 USB ports, VGA port and audio out. It DOES NOT have inbuilt speakers."
4,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 3 months. I got it from Amazon at 8300. I don't play games usually so this review doesn't covers that point. I usually use it for web surfing, watching movies and web series, photos n video editing.Pros :Excellent picture quality.Quite durable and build quality is superb.It comes with 2 hdmi ports.Menu button is smartly fitted below screen which is not visible and you can change variety of settings just through one button.Quality of hdmi cable provided is good.Cons:Nothing as such.It would have been better if they had provided 1 USB port.To summarize if you are looking for a good monitor under 10k, you can definitely go for it :)"
1,Don't buy this product of Acer. Within 2 month monitor has got 3 inches vertical black line in led. I'm keep calling Acer service they won't giving me replacement. 20 days complete after complaint got received by  Acer.  Please don't waste your money on this product. My first acer product and I'm sooo much disappointed 😞
1,"I have received the product as a replacement since the monitor I received the first time switched off after 20 mins of usage. Now the replacement I received is also defective, there is a blue line on the top left of the monitor. I think the seller TPS technologies is selling all defective product s."
2,"Good Monitor. perfect resolution for 32"" screen. Quality of picture is not that great and backlit is very strong coming from corners. Black level is just satisfactory. Although screen is good in this range, Acer's QA is not good, I had to replace the screen as there were dead pixels on screen. Replaced screen also has 1 dead pixel but its ok as I don't want to waste more time in replacement. Acer should consider QA seriously."

5,"I was on the lookout for a new HD TV (1080p) 32' size for my Parents and looking at how low the price is for a 2k (1440p) display, I ended up buying Acer EB321HQU 32Inch (2560x1440), Monitor thinking ill end up return the product. But surprisingly the monitor is of a good make give perfect (2560x1440) with great darks all at 60hz on my PC. I could not wait to give a review on this product. Very impressed."
5,"Before I purchased this monitor I brought LG 22MP68VQ which was arrived faulty. And I replaced and brought again about 4 time from amazon but each and every time it arrives with at-least one fault. But LG and their customer service center did nothing.I added few photos of this monitor comparing to LG monitors side by side. In one of this photos it can noticed that back light glowing issue of IPS panel far more better in ACER than LG. Also anti-glare coating is good in this ACER Monitor.Also this ACER monitor supports 75Hz refresh rate @ 1080X1920.disadvantages in this monitor is negligible like NO SOFTWARE CONTROL and color isn't calibrated.also it is ""21.5 inch"" not ""22 inch"" diagonal. so it looks little smaller than LG 22MP68VQ. The stand provided is a old style one but very steady where LG looks stylish but not steady like it.For gaming, I think its good because of typical IPS response time but no free sync (while LG free sync on 22MP68VQ questionable) and no back-light stabilization.In spite of that drawbacks...Overall, Grate monitor for all purpose use.wait for an offer because more than 7k isn't worthy for this product."
4,"I received the product on 26th Sept 2018. Before starting, let me clear that I am writing for Acer EB321HQU 32inches with 2K resolution and IPS panel display. The reason for mentioning this is that amazon treats all comments under the same umbrella of the product. Though, there are variations among them. My current feedback would be based on the first impression. This will be updated after a few months of usage.To start up, let me share the pros and then cons of the product.Pros:1. 32 inches screen with IPS panel2. 2K resolution good for this big size display3. Easy menu configuration4. PIP option5. Good contrast ratio6. Cost wise, economical7. Good to have 3 years of warrantyCons:1. Does not have swivel stand2. One can notice a minute color shift from end to other. Though this is fine due to big screen size.3. Fixed refresh rate 60Hz. This may not be good for those who are looking for hardcore gaming stuffs.4. No AMD freesync or Nvidia gsync option. Again, not good for gaming seekers.Conclusion: If you are looking for a light gaming and day to day task with having a big screen size and economical, then go for it."
4,"The monitor is your standard run of the mill VGA monitor, viewing angles are decent and better than those horrible cheap TFT panels.Picture and colours are nice but nothing outstanding here. The response time of 4ms makes it good for gaming for a 60hz monitor.The mounting stand is not the most stable but is built solid metal while the bottom of the stand is plastic.PS- The monitor only looks to be thin bezeled and it very much not so, i.e. the monitor has permanent black bars around those bezels when the display is on, making the thin bezels pretty much redundant and a false representation of the product.All in all a decent buy for its price of around 7k."
4,"Nice product in very good price ,but i didn't receive HDMI cable , picture quality is very nice ,true bezzals less display , recommend for all.thanks Amazon for on time delivery"
5,"My only qualm is the pricing range - watchout for the 15% swing in prices before buying. There is no price drop guarantee. At the same time, I wonder if this is subject to used Vs unused screens. Or if it's just an algorithm.Hint: I could have returned it for free and purchased it again when it hit at least 10% lower. But realized that this would be a national waste. Ideally, such larger products should have come with a price drop guarantee."
5,"Very nice product. Thanks to amazon for delivering the product before the time-line even in the lockdown that too at remote area of Kolhapur.In the package contains 1) Screen 2) Stand 3) Power adaptor & cable 4) 3.5mm male to male connector. 5) VGA cable 6) HDMI Cable.  (( Reason i'm specifying the items because. before buying this product, I gone through comments & found that people didn't receive HDMI & VGA cables in the packaging)).I got this screen @8.2k in ""todays deal"". otherwise usually it priced somewhere around 10k. ( Do check-out price on Flpkrt for best price range comparison).The Screen bezels are very thin ( 0.5 cms ). & display is quite sharp. Overall value for money product."
5,"I literally have no word...initially I was little skeptic about my purchase..hoooooooop..what a monitor...it's giant..it's heavy..not that sturdy.. little delicate to use..& most importantly bright vivacious display...for my eye concern, I have a setup of zero brightness & zero contrast.. let me tell you it moreover feels like an AMOLED if you can ignore IPS illumination..one more thing, like to share with you that the monitor comes with HDMI cable inside the box & it supports 2560 * 1440 (2k) resolution, is rendering over 90 pixels/inch.. I have bought a DVI dual channel cable separately as I have a PC & a laptop so switching physically every time won't be that good either for device or for cable ports as well.surprisingly, DVI D cable can handle 2880 * 1620 resolution, is rendering over 100 pixels/inch..but the difference is HDMI can allow audio signal where DVI can not.. i.e. you won't be able to get audio output while DVI is connected..most interestingly my 11.6"" laptop screen gets opened with this monitor over 1080p resolution.. rendering by 2048 * 1152.. which looks pretty crisp & clear..yet I can't recommend this monitor for gaming.. let me tell you why! because it handles up to 60 Hz framerate.. for regular work or still visual this monitor is surely recommended.. rather for gaming I would suggest 120 Hz or above.. framerate or refresh rate more matters for gaming experience over FHD, 2k or 4k resolution..the only thing I have found, it slightly hunches in forward direction..what I really miss in this monitor is an USB port was pretty expected there at the backside..Thanks to Acer...Thanks to Amazon...probably the best online purchase with highest level of satisfaction..Edited..check out the last photo I've included..you can get a clear about two things(i) Viewing angle(ii) Black level even being an AMOLED panel..for those who are shouting if it is a VA panel instead of an IPS.."
1,"27 inch screen size is too large for 1080p.Was using samsung 24 inch 1080p monitor and this monitor is worse compared to that. Its cheap product so overall quality is also cheap. Its good if you just want to play videos and not at all good for reading and gaming as pixel per inch is on the lower side. Games don't run smooth. Replacing for a lower size monitor, 22 inch with same resolution."
5,"Overall good, there is slight color bleeding at the edges, not true 10 bit Panel (8bit+Acer tricks) as mentioned, still looks good, controls are pathetic, switching to another active source of input is Pain in the ass, no source switching shortcut button for a 3 input (hdmi, Dvi-d, Display ports) ??? Seriously acer! Relief is it has PIP. Won’t detect the other source even after pain staking TRICKY manual switching from menu? This is the greatest of all—>> Can’t go into Menu without a input Cable! or when it is not detecting the input with cable connected!!! Are you kidding me?Still i’m ok, because 32” UHD IPS Monitor with 4 ms response for 19000? you got me here Acer!!!"
4,"Purchased it on July, 2020. Delivered in less than 24 hours. I am writing this review after using it for 2 weeks.Pros:1. Almost no bezel. The entire screen is utilized by the picture.2. Light weight.3. Picture quality and pixels are sharp and is good for professional use like programming, emails, etc.4. Brightness is good. Will be comfortably able to view the screen clearly in a well lit room. But there is also the presence of some glare.Cons:1. The screen goes off suddenly for a second when there is voltage fluctuations. Maybe if someone turns on a tube light which is connected to the same voltage line, the screen goes off for a second and comes back. I really hope that it is not a serious problem. Usually happens around 4-5 times a day. Poor quality from Acer.2. The screen is more warmer with high white balance. I tried changing all the possible settings, and the white balance doesn't decrease beyond a certain level. Maybe uncomfortable initially, but you may get used to it later.3. The settings button is behind the screen and it is very difficult to identify which button corresponds to which setting. I spent almost half an hour to just set the right colour combinations.4. The height of the screen cannot be adjusted unlike how it is possible in other monitors. The user needs to somehow manage to the default height of the monitor. But the angle/tilt of the screen can be adjusted.5. Comes with an inbuilt speaker. Sound quality is not great and the volume is very less. I am using my laptop speaker instead. Not much of use with the inbuilt speaker."
5,"This monitor changed my life. As retarded as that sounds, let me explain. I use a lot of photoshop to create graphics and also use excel regularly. I used my laptop screen before upgrading to this monitor.The big screen and high resolution of the monitor, remove most scrolling and zooming that was part of my daily life. It literally changed the way I work and increased efficiency. The increased size removed some 30 minutes of pointless work from my daily routine. Worth every single rupee I paid and more.Don't game much, so if you are a gamer look elsewhere as this is 60 Hz monitor with no special features.Also, it's an IPS monitor, so don't expect to get a perfect black image in a dark room. Nothing can do that well except OLED and if you are looking at this, you can't afford an OLED monitor."
5,"Since I have got this monitor it feels as if other displays are fake or cheap quality products wherever and whatever I see. Given I use it for my office work it simply enhances and improves the windows image quality dragged on from laptop screen to secondary screen(monitor). It somehow retains the quality even when seen from various angles. Has got anti glare properties which saves you when light is coming from behind. They definitely included a hdmi extender (male to female) but should include other types of connecting cables as well. Further, they should have provided plastic caps to cover other ports not in use. But overall satisfied with using this monitor."
4,Screen is broken completely . Shipping box also looks like it has been re packed many times . Big scamUpdate : got the product replaced however speakers on the replacement unit are not working although which is not a big problem because I am connecting to external speakers anyway.Coming to display it is very nice colours are sharp no bleeding no backlight error no dead pixels . Pretty satisfied with the overall package .
5,"PROSIPS display makes every detail come out clean and crisp and brillaint colour reproduction.There is a speaker at the back end of the monitor not many people write about it but this model has it. Speaker is a 5 watt speaker I think not sure.Monitor has not heat generation for the IPS display. I have used it straight for 14 to 15 hours and my eye does not feel pain as its IPS display and also has eye care and blue light filter.Cons:If you are including a speaker then two 5 watts would make sense rather than overall 5 watt.Also my unit came with a VGA cable where as seller mentions a HDMI cable. Please be specific, have to spend another 400 for a descent HDMI cable."
5,"The product was delivered in fine condition, and I did not find any dead pixels reported by few customers. Even I was worried about it, but that was not the case. It's no less than your average TV in size, so keep in mind while buying. The overall quality is good nothing to complaint about. Don't expect speakers, as you need external ones to be connected to it. Remember if you go for curved monitors you won't get the high resolution as this monitor provides at this cost."
1,Received today 6th sep 2020 a screen with one stuck pixel and a big blue block on bottom right when you turn screen to black color. I can ignore the stuck pixcel but blue block is very hard to be ignored.This is my second purchase of same monitor. Earlier one was quite perfect and running without any issue since two yearsDisappointed with seller on this one . I assume it's a manufacturing qa defect and seller has not sent the defective piece intentionally. I will give a benefit of doubt and I'll aks for a replacement piece. Hope seller accept replacement rather than return. I have waited for this monitor for long time as it took more than week for shipping. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.
5,"As of now i am using it as TV with HD set top box. this model has audio out( head phone out) and its working well. I connected to Set top box as well as to a computer. We don't need to touch the buttons on the monitor or a remote  for changing the input, Monitor automatically changes to next input, if we power off the set box it searches for next input like DVI port or Display port and it detects and changes to it."
5,"There were many negative reviews on Amazon for this monitor which was concerning. When I checked the latest reviews overall reviews were positive and hence I went ahead and I am happy to  report that this Monitor exceeded my expectations for price of 16K INR inclusive of offers .I had already  ordered it for 20K but  cancelled  it, and ordered at new offer price. The refund process was hassle free . At 20K INR this monitor is good buy, at 16K its value for money.I already have a BenQ 24 inch Full HD monitor and in terms of picture quality and pixel density they compare same.In two days I have got used to size of this Acer monitor  and it would be difficult to go back to any lesser size . I now use BenQ as secondary monitorPros:The 32 inch size and 1440p resolution is good for office work and multimedia, and it does not feel too big .The pixel density is is same as 1080p 24 inch monitor but the amount of information you see is much more due to increased resolution.The placement of I/O ports are well done .Good selection of I/O ports with HDMI/DP/DVI with Audio out. Note that audio will not work with DVI.IPS panel with good viewing angles and color reproduction and without any significant IPS Glow.For 16K-17K INR it is value for money and you cannot find any other Monitor in its class for this price.VESA mount is supported and setting up Stand was easiest I had done for any Monitor.Cons:No audio over DVI port on Monitor , I tried connecting PS4 and Dell Laptop, via DVI to HDMI adapter.The games appear somewhat blurry if you are not using Native Resolution of monitor.  I tested with PS4 which can only output 1080p, there was slight blur but it did not bother me much."
4,The only feature we are paying so much for this monitor is full hd 1080p. Otherwise all other features are same as compared to cheaper monitor. Feels vague giving too much money for this only feature. Also not recommended for gaming because it don't have any extensive features that gaming monitors should have like 75hz display and freesync. I think it's a good monitor for people into animations and editing videos.
5,"Its edges are blurred and overall picture quality is really bad. DOnt buy it, I have another 32 inch LG monitor (1920X1080) which has a great picture quality and clarity in display. Acer on the other hand is worst.The replaced product doesnt have any issues and have very good quality, I think the seller deliberately sent the defective piece , first time around."
5,"Been a couple of weeks since I have been using this and it has been working well so far. The product came nicely packaged and arrived within projected time. Received a HDMI cable along with the monitor. The monitor feels well designed and viewing experience has been good so far. Can't speak for gaming, since I haven't sued it for that purpose. The 32 inch screen size is good for work or browsing and the 2K screen resolution is well detailed."
5,"I'm no display expert, but can definitely say the difference between a good display and an average display. For a budget price and for a more not so comprehensive requirement, this monitor fits the bill. Nice big display for an average sized room, neatly built, has several display enhancing features. The quality is crisp and extremely pleasant when viewed. Definitely recommending if you would want a descent WQHD monitor."
5,"After lot of research and conclusion I have rated this monitor the best. The screen clarity of 1440p at 32"" makes your text readable and crisp and the video wonderful. Though there is minimum bleeding of light on black screen that is common in IPS panel, all is best. Have a audio port out that helps to redirect the HDMI audio out through it.I have compared to the QLED 27"" Samsung and the text are vert crisp and very much readable. I am a coder myself and very very satisfied with the performance at this price point of 20K for this 32"" IPS panel monitor."
5,"- This is the most aggressively priced 32” QHD monitor (2k monitor). I couldn’t find a cheaper monitor with the same specs from any brand- Picture quality, brightness are decent- I am not a gamer and I don’t care about high refresh rates at all- I mainly use it for WFH and consuming video. For these purposes it’s excellent- The backlight bleed is a non-issue. The panel I got does have backlight bleed but thats a limitation of the manufacturing process. More importantly, I didn’t get any dead pixels, been 2+ months now.- Please ignore comments wrt backlight bleed. Most of them are needlessly hyping the issue and are woefully ignorant of the manufacturing process of the monitor. In day to say usage it will not affect you at all.-32 inch and 2k gives you a lot more screen real estate. You can fit more windows without it being too small. This is great for WFH.-This is VESA mount compatible, 100x100An excellent monitor that I would recommend to anyone for WFH, especially to budget conscious customers."
4,Bought this at 7500/- as a second monitor.  Other one is from LG.Pro's -Supports Vesa  Mount - 100 by 100.Screen quality is good.Solid base to support the screen. Doesn't shake while working.3.5 mm Audio output is there. Can be connected to External Speakers.Con's -Don't buy for the inbuilt speakers.Buttons on the side of the screen are tricky.Didn't like the inbuilt Blue light filter. In Blue light filter mode -- Brightness and Contrast are high which makes it unusable.Workaround for blue light filter  -- It's supporting the Night light feature of the Laptop connected through HDMI. Helpful for long office working hours.
5,The decision was hayway due to negative reviews... But decision was worth it..got this 32 wqhd monitor for15k... One of the best purchases.. The unit which I got has no issues.. Yes it has some screen bleeding issues and that is normal and considarable for all the ips display out there.... I use this monitor near the window and 25% of brightness is more than enough for me.. At nights I do reduce the same to 10 to 15 and don't see any screen bleeding issues... Watching netflix and prime in this thing at full resolution is amazing... Color reproduction is great... Overall its good monitor for a casual user (I use it for 12 to 14 hrs a day)... Not for gamers for sure... More than 10 days pf purchase no issues
4,"Everything is good about the monitor for a normal computer user who watches movies, yputube, read new papers, checking email, doing regular office works etc.One isssue i found is if u keep brightness low, like below 50, right end of the mpnitor will become slightly dark.Brightness wont be even on the monitor.I bought same monitor 2 weeks back. i asked for replacement. Amazon replced it smoothly. Replaced one was better, yet had same issueThis piece i bought before 3 days. It has the same issue with the brightness.If u are not a person who keeps brightness low, there is no problem at allEverything else is very good for a regular userbought another 24 inch model. Just awsome onereviwing after one monthexcellent color combinationgreat built qualitythoroughly satisfied with the new purchase"
1,"I am from Hyderabad. Like all of you, I also read all the above reviews, watched YouTube videos, thought a lot and finally decided on this 31.5 inch Acer monitor. From years, I am stuff buying from Amazon. Trusting the brand, I paid and ordered online. As I took out of the box with lot of hope, to my bad, I saw those yellow curved at the bottom of the screen inside. Didn't expect Amazon will send such defective pieces to its loyal and prime customers. Very disappointed. Its says 2k resolution but in reality you don't actually that image quality. And, you can see in the above pictures the pathetic light bleeding from all the edges. I want to cancel this and go for a different model but Amazon for now is allowing only replacing with a fresh piece. Lets see how it will be. Nevertheless, I lost hope and looking forward to a other brand."
5,"Excellent monitor from Acer. I got IPS panel monitor. 31.5 inch with 2k excellent combination. I use it for coding, so now I can split window in to 4 or 3 parts to work efficiently.Seller Xtronicsapp is very helpful to me to choose the monitor. As I was more worried about the size. I was confused between 27 and 32 inch monitor. But as it was 32 with 2k, so I am not able to resist at this price.Packaging was excellent. It was packed with four layers, out of four two layers are bubble wrap. Very good for Big and delicate items like monitor. I got the monitor in excellent condition. Also working properly.Thank you for both seller Xtronicsapp and Amazon for providing excellent monitor at best price."
1,"After 5 times they replace the product and every time they give me used one broken one and different product also and the of my complaint acre support are saying, IPS display is not a defect and is a feature for better viewing which appears in a dark background.So why they replaced my panel 5 times. and am not using ips panel 1st time in my life I know how display look don't buy it and @acersupport making bad product and bad service also"
4,This is my first monitor which i'm using with my laptop.below are the observations so far.1. colors a pretty good. viewing angles are also good2. suitable for casual work. not for gaming at all3. I just use this monitor for browsing and coding.4. black color is not so good but it is expected for this price range.5. Top is more brighter than bottom.For whom this monitor is far??casual users who are looking for big screen for movies and entertainment and casual graphic designers. and developers.
5,"Very much happy with this.. i was planing to buy LG but some how ended up buying this one. This a good display and also produces good colors. No screen bleeding or any problems at all. I will recommend this one. And please note that every monitor is LCD it only has LED backlite,Which is better.The only thing i dont like is the design of stand it looks old fashioned but you wont care after seeing how thin the display is and its overall performance."
4,"At first I got damaged monitor that means there is a screen Bleeding issue, I talk to customer care and they replaced me with new one, which is in excellent condition and no issues. Thanks Amazon. Monitor is a very good choice for everyone.i purchase at 15k. In box they provide hdmi cable also."
4,"Product received today afternoon. No HDMI Cable, only a VGA cable and power cord.  Otherwise ok. Clear pic and good colors."
5,"For the price, it was really hard to find a monitor of this spec at 32"". I was surprised how much bigger this unit was compared to my existing 24"" BenQ 2411HD! It had wall mount options but I'm using it with desk mount. The rear is white but it isn't standing out when viewed from front. The bezels are slim and the design is elegant. I'm using it via DVI. In terms of brightness, this is way superior to any monitors in the sub 30k inr price range I've come across. I'm not an expert on monitors but the grey bleeding on screen edges are pronounced with black images or game backgrounds. The response time is similar to the BenQ for games. I was considering getting a 32"" micro max fhd TV instead of the monitor, but I'm glad I got the monitor instead. Have seen the micromax TV (otherwise brilliant) have noticeable lag in gaming. For movies, it offers much clear and brighter rendering."
5,"It is very good 👍🏻, But money doesn't grow on trees, Don't buy till ur a millionaire, Try getting a Smaller one"
5,This is an excellent product for those who don't care too much about losing a kidney to the black market. But I tell you it's worth it.
5,The monitor that i was looking for but who would pay 2L for a monitor? The one who qouted the price must be drunk
5,"For this price, one could buy a PS5 for 40k, construct a gaming rig for 50k, a one plus for 30k, a decent gaming monitor around 20k and invest the remaining 50k in stocks/ mutual funds. 💡"
5,"Lame va panel of ips like quality, though widescreen and high refresh rate, better buy an oled tv if you want to spend this kind of money on a display."
4,Inox used this in their theatres and named as ImaxNow I can go inside the monitor while I game for next level immersive experience.200Hz refresh rate made me win every online tournaments. But still paying EMI for the next 2years
5,"I have been using this monitor from last one week without any issues. If you want crisp clear display then it is better to go for a higher resolution monitor which would obviously cost more. This one is good for your regular work. I don't think it has the Free Sync as mentioned in the product description. The bezel is there but minimal. Overall worth buying for the price if you want a 27"" monitor."
5,Possibly the best one within this price range. Been using it on my wall like a TV with Firestick. Colors are accurate and bezels are minimal.
5,"If you need a 27"" sized monitor with decent quality and thin bezels with VESA mount options, this is the best option. There are better monitors if you want picture quality or gaming-related features."
4,Best monitor in this price range
4,Nice and worth for money
5,"I received the package , 2 days after ordering. All components were present: Monitor, stand, power cable, VGA cable. The monitor's plug and play function really was helpful as all the device drivers were installed automatically. Everything is in working condition."
2,overall product is not that good as i expected ..... this comes with no power cable ..... i had to buy it separately..... only vga/d-sub input.... i would give it a 3 or 4 star if it comes with power cable.... its a headache almost.....
1,"This is E2016HV not E2016H model. If you are looking monitor having 170 degree viewing angle then this is not that item. Be clear before you order.Cons:1. Over bright2. Over contrast3. More whitish color. You cant pure black on this screen.4. Viewing angle is 90 degree5. Seller wrote wrong information. He is sending Dell E2016HV model6. Painful for eyes if you are sitting long time.Pros:Not interested to write, but below given by Dell customer care center.1. Improvised model2. Consume less power. This monitor have good quality in colorIf you have used any Dell 20 inch monitor, don't get misguided with this product."
4,Screen
1,It's not led.its LCD.
3,"On the first occasion I got a defective product, which Amazon replaced (sadly we don't have option of return). After replacement product was working OK but it's an old technology TN screen and the effects are bluntly visible. Very poor viewing angle, even a slight tilt from perfect 90 can cause change in colours. You can see the difference in shades in the attached photos. It's annoying. It has settings for Cool, Warm etc. shades but none seem good enough for my eyes and I had to manually adjust the brightness and contrast. Only connectivity option is serial cable which is a big disappointment. No speakers as well. I believe cheap things come at there own price."
1,"This monitor is really dull. You would want to beat it and bring it to life.Picture quality is not good. Sharpness is alright. Overall it’s a strain on your eyes to keep looking at it. Dell’s predecessors on LCD monitors were really good, not sure if it’s Dell’s strategy to make people buy the more expensive LED monitors. With continuous use you’ll get used to it, but it’s blaring evident that the monitor is not a good make. And unfortunately you CANNOT return this item but only get a replacement of the same one."
4,This product is value for money but in this package missing of CD. So when you install this product on your PC that time you need to download this product driver that a negative point but not a Dil breaking overall the product is good for day to day using.
3,"I didnt get a stamped warranty card and instalation CD for my new dell E2016HV monitor..please advice me ,how can I get a warranty without warranty card.The display quality is average and ....amazon did it realy a LED monitor....I dont think so,antiglare feature is not there ..I didnt expect it from amazon.."
5,"Very good Screen Size and compatible with CPU's of different makes and models. Very good display and Power saving mode facility.  I am yet to adjust the Brightness and Contrast as it took me some time to figure them out. Delivered well within the timelines and on Time, and neatly packaged and wrapped up. Certainly Worth The Money for what it has been offered. Thanks for the Price discount, Very much appreciated & recommended. Thank You !"
1,Doesn't come with power cable...also don't have HDMI...better to go with other brand ...waste of money..
4,"I needed a monitor to complete my PC build but since having spent most of my budget on system components, I had to cheap out on the screen(get a lower priced screen). This one offered decent specs at the price and a resolution of 1600x900 at 60Hz and screen brightness at 250 nits, is absolutely fine if you're in a similar situation or looking for a secondary monitor. It has a down side though, it doesn't have an HDMI port and only has a single VGA port, very restricted. Other than that, it is a great product, value for money."
1,"This is a useless product in fact they cheat you by passing on such dangerous to use and low quality products.Donot trust everything sold on Amazon.Before I could find out defects,return window was closed.Anyways it’s too bright,glare is unbearable and you can’t see anything while viewing at an angle. I am going to buy another one.Waste of money"
5,"My main objective buying this is for working, I have WFH option and wanted to make my work place at home look similar to my office. This monitor does what it's meant and is very pleasing in terms of viewing. I initially thought the product was damaged as the screen looked like having a whitish bright area in the centre only to later realize that it was just my imagination and had something to do with initial connectivity. The packing was on par and was neatly covered. Amazon did it's part in sending the product in 2 days time. Highly recommended."
1,This product is the Worst viewing angle. Please don't buy this. I want my money back please help. Please replace this product with another product and i would definitely buy. I want my refund now. Please help me out with this. please.
1,"Original product had to be replaced within a month of delivery because of color bleed. Replacement product has multiple color bleed patches within 5 to 6 months of replacement. Bad product. Tried reaching Dell technical service, post troubleshooting they said, monitor will be replaced, later they said the monitor was damaged. Requested for physical inspection of the monitor to establish it was indeed damaged. With no damage / signs of it, being told it was damaged was not a happy situation.... 3 years warranty being claimed by Dell is defunct, they just don't honor it. ***Don't by this product***"
1,Worst picture quality please don’t buy looking at the rating as like me.The first image is from the dell screen and the second image is from my laptop and here easily you can see the difference
5,"Ordered from Amazon this model and Team Amazon delivered well before the date promised....This is definitely a good monitor if you get it around rs 6K . Useful as an additional monitor ( to extend your laptop screen)  or in small shops at point of sale etc.Used it for the last 3 days and works as expected.The only downside being  - Height not adjustable ( does not matter much) and no HDMI port (use VGA to HDMI connector cord for that). If you ignore these two aspects,  this is definitely a good monitor in this range.Colors / Brightness can be adjusted very easily.Overall, good experience , see pic."
4,Its a decent budget monitor. We cant expect much out of it. It has only via connector. Best monitor to buy for this price range. If it has a HDMI i will give 5 star
4,"It's big! Really big for the price. But it lacks ips display and the color scheme is not good. I could clearly see the difference since i use dual monitors. I replaced it a friend of mine. Because when you are using dual monitors you need to see the same color on both monitors.So, if you r buying it for dual monitor then please don't buy. Go for Samsung with IPS display. Extra 1-2k will not go in vain."
1,The box is written 1600×900p but the screen can run on 1920×1080p
2,it is just a monitor .  very much disappointed after seeing the image quality . No colour in depth. u can see a dull an a defaced Image quality  . local brand can give better image quality and clarity than this . Dont waste money in this size and range.
5,"The 19.5 inch LED Monitor is of amazing quality, delivered within 2 days with all the accessories.Picture Quality on 1080p is excellent, the power saving works good.Installation is easy, just like another Comouter Monitor."
3,"If you are planning to buy this product only for computer purpose then it is value for money product. But if you are planning to use it for multi function means for computer and for watching videos, movies etc. then you will be disappointed little bit because you can see movies etc only if you are in the front of screen. Video will not be clear with change of angel (Negative appearance)"
1,"I am totally not satisfied with the picture quality, since  I am not able to see the screen/pictures from side views and also some 2 mtr distance it is showing like  negative pictures, faces are not able see and head is not visible, in totally I am notice able to recognise the person."
5,Wow it was good Monitor.VGA cable and Power cable both are inside that's petty surprise for me.I recommended to all with this price worth to buy.
5,Awesome product ☺️😊👍. It seems in the review section I saw a lot of bad reviews but still i bought it . It is not bad . Display is very good for this amount . There is no speaker but that's not a problem I think . After 1andhalf yr the monitor got complaint due to some extent electricity prblm but as it was in warranty I got it replaced within 1 week . Very good
4,"Overall great value for money. But there is some problem with colour contrast. Unable to see light blue colours. For instance when I select some tabs in excel or click on something in chrome, it does not turn blue."
1,"Defective product stopped working next day. Please do not sell defective/repaired items, otherwise people will lose trust in online shopping. I am glad Amazon gave me a full refund. I got a nice monitor from flipkart instead."
3,Amazon is saying it's LED but it's LCD. The problem with this monitor is that you can not get good quality of picture if you are viewing screen from side. You have to tilt the screen according to your sitting position.
5,Good product in 5k price range19.5 inch display with a little washed off colours!But I suppose that’s what is to be expected in this price range :)Base is little worrying as it’s not fixed properly to the stand
1,This is not LED monitor and no matter what setting you try text will appear blurry on this monitor.  First i thought its my computer issue but no after testing on other Pcs result is same.  You have been warned.
5,"Go to my YouTube channel ""current technical news"" and see its unboxing video. Thanks"
1,"picture quality is very poor, when compared to older dell monitorsand there is no display port as mentioned in product title.. just VGA portbetter to spend some more money and buy better quality monitor"
5,Picture quality is A-class but then again I have a affinity for Dell displays. Has had no faults till date. Two years and going strong.
5,Working fine till now after I received the monitor packed in well manner. I recommend this product for every kind of usage with desktop PC. I am actually using it as an additional display with my laptop and experiencing good.
4,"It's a decent monitor for the price. But the main pros (USP) of this monitor doesn't actually enhance your experience. Here are those features:- Super Sleek design: I personally wouldn't care if a monitor is sleek or not. It's anyways lying on the desk.- Light weight: Again, not a feature I would be asking from a monitor.- Edgeless design: Although this is a major feature for enhancing the experience, the white border below ruins it all for you. It's so distracting. I would've appreciated a black border on the front at least.Talking about other features:- Sound quality isn't that appealing. It's ok.- Screen: It took me a couple of days to get adjusted to the screen picture quality. It's good but I still feel it's not the best.I previously order Dell 2421H, the readability and sound quality in that monitor are surely better than this. Due to some manufacturing defect I had to return it and later it's price increased way above my budget. So I had to settle for this one.Drawbacks:- This monitor doesn't have a wall mount option.- Also, it stands tilted slightly towards the left. I have read the same opinion from some other reviews as well.All in all, I would rate it decent in every aspect. No major drawbacks as such, but nothing extraordinary as well."
5,No words to say.Simply awesome...worth for every penny.. Awesome picture clarity awesome sound clarity ..its a jackpot gift  from HP.I assure its perfectly for programmers and designers ..worth for every penny.
3,"video quality is okay, audio is great as long as you don't connect a headphone... most importantly, no USB port"
1,"This monitor I purchased from  Amazon on  13.09.21 , now it's not working,  when contacted hp , they told display unit problem,  to contact physically nearby hp service centre, after reaching hp service  centre, they given free suggestion to purchase new one - Pathetic Service"
1,Defective product
1,The monitor was fine for the first 10 days. Then the monitor started overlapping the previous picture/screen. The shadow of the previous screen could be visible as seen in the pictures provided. The HP official support has been really lousy and unresponsive.
1,"does'nt work, Hp probably ships refurbished products during sales."
4,Lightweight and premium looking. Picture quality is okay. But first for the price.
5,Good picture quality
4,"Good Monitor,Product deliverd without Amazon Package."
3,Pros and cons both are equal for this productSound quality is not good
1,Its very bad product giving headact while working
2,Video Player is loading.
1,"Firstly, he product isn't working, I take it out and plug it in, it isn't working,  I've been handling computers since Avery young age and this product is top obviously the worst I've ever come across, and once I applied for return they won't even take it back so whoever you are looking at this monitor thinking of buying it DON'T think anymore just move on! because this is a good scam you could be a part of."
1,This product should not be accepted for sale
5,The monitor clarity is just amazing.The pictures look very vividAnd best value monitor for gaming.The build quality very good as well.
5,Superb monitor best pricing and value for money monitor is working great and display is great with clarity perfect monitor to have one.
5,"Its an amazing product, good screen, great quality, adjustable brighness ,don't heat up even after 3 hours and more, if seen from corners the screen don't turns black which is an amazing thing in this price, good respond rate, lightweight(very lightweight though), good shiny surface giving it a modern look and overall best product for this price...."
4,This is a budget monitor don't imagine big type of monitor but it is good monitor for using online class i will give 4 stars
1,Defective product pl change
1,ITS TO SMALL AND THERE IS A LOT OF GLARE IN THE SCREE
1,"Hello Everyone .. I am Ritesh Pandit from J&K and I am a professional photographer and editor... As my experience don't buy Zebster... actually it gives you fake colours, over brightnessAnd etc... I face many times colour problems during my colour Correction editing... So you can buy another monitors but please don't buy this ...🙏🙏"
3,This  moniter doesnt  include  power  cabel  and  seller  say  that  it  included  ...Pless  dont  misguide  custmer
1,I didn’t get the Power Chord or the VGA cable as advertised. Hard to imagine how someone can miss some key accessories without which it is totally not usable.
2,"I bought two of these monitors, and none had the power cord. So, if you add the power cord price as well, the it becomes expensive. The viewing angle is poor. Colors are not correct either."
1,"Please dont buy this product. Picture quality is very bad. Picture look better on my less resolution laptop than on this high resolution monitor. I tried connecting this monitor both to low and high resolution laptop but problem is same.  When I asked for a replacement seller ""Cloud Tech IT Solutions"" rejected my request but with amazon intervention they provided the replacement. But even the replacement is not good. So I immediately return it.Please please dont buy this product at least from ""Cloud Tech IT Solutions"". very bad quality."
2,I had purchased this monitor for CCTV viewing. The monitor functioned well for a few days after which a display message started appearing regarding my screen resolution. At this point i tried to press the function buttons on the monitor and this is when i realised that other than the power button none of the other function buttons were working
4,As the product says it's just a entry level monitor.It can be used as secondary monitor for your PC 🖥 or laptop 💻  for offloading some office work.I will not recommend this a main monitor for game monitor.Drawback - this doesn't come with power cord.  I bought the power cord from local vendor for Rs 60.HDMI cable included.Overall I satisfied.
5,"Look Like pictur Full HD quality,Slim Design (in box 1Moniter+1hdmi cable+1book) and paisa-usel product under ₹6899/- but one problem face delivery partner is very very bad this product Amazon fulfil but not received door step pickups me amazing store 12day leter.(area pin- 731233)"
3,What i am doing without Power & VGA cable. Both are missing i get return back this  product.
4,Very good in this price..vga and power cord not included its may be for cost cutting ..no problem hdmi cable included.good picture quality.
5,VGA cable missing only received HDMI cable and box damage photo attached
3,"The product is only fine for basic stuff. I am getting blur view on the screen and is trying to identify what is the cause of it. However, no power cable came in the box. Have to deal for that as well now :-("
1,"I didn't received the power chord with monitor, in first time ,then I asked for replacement, in replacement item also I didn't get the power chord, now what am I supposed to do, what the heck is going on. A monitor is supposed to be given with power chord. This is really frustrating"
1,I dislike this product because of power card included the bill but I received this product without power card and Hdmi cable also. I replaced that order too again also cable are not dispatched...
1,"Wrong power cable was sent.HDMI Connector very loose and continuously connects / disconnects.Very faded picture quality.Overall, though it has a brand name, it is very bad & inferior quality."
4,"Its ok and the pocture quality is decent , but i am happy with this price and price worthy"
3,"Got the Monitor in good condition, however power cord is missing from the package. Unable to start the monitor"
3,As per your inclided component details power cable and VGA cable missingPlease provide me immidiatly
1,"Naaah...This is not what I wanted,Picture quality is low, images look pixelated, not happy with the purchase, never expected this from such a brand called Lenovo"
5,It is a pretty descent monitor at this price range. It works very good. I would recommend others to buy this monitor if you are low at budget and are looking for an HDMI monitor.
5,Very good picture quality and color. I got the same as expected.
4,Nice product.
2,"As per budget of 7 to 8 thousands its product is good but main problem is picture quality not much as expected, if compare from others"
4,Power Cable is missing and it is royal pain to reach customer service as they will suggest return entire productSo I bought myself power cable
1,Power cable is missing. Just a plastic box without it. Not useable.
5,Veri nice👍👏😊
1,2nd hand refurbished product sent with no accessories (not even power cable)Waste of time and money
4,Power cable missing in the box
4,In this price okayLcd monitor with led backliteHdmi and vgA
1,Horrible piece of monitor and comes without a power cord such that you cannot start it!! Classic case of cheating.
4,Hdm not working
1,This is a replaced product. Both packages were missing the power cord. I have given up now. Trying to find a three pin power adapter.
1,Unable to use without power chord. Says it is included but I did not receive it
4,"The power cord is not included, and the BOX label also  says so ""1 CORD"" (HDMI) is included , the listing is misleading"
2,This product doesn't have power cable and VGA cabel
5,Very good
3,"Cons:1.) There are two many wires as it's has a separate laptop like adapter for plugin.2.) Inbuild speakers are useless, better if is not available, I mean 2 watt speaker, not sure what is the purpose.3.) There is a AUX in cable, the speaker itself is useless, what's the means of input cable, it's better to have AUX out, at least you can use external speaker to permanently fix on your table.4.) There is not a single USB port.5.) There is no adjustment of screen, not even tilted one forget up and down.6.) For my use I don't feel the adjustment is right, moreover you don't have choice to adjust.7.) There are many wires visible on table, there is no holding point in monitor.8.) Decent pricePros:1.) The white color looks awesome2.) Bazzle free design3) Superb slim4.) light weight - 2.5 KGI feel if the height/tilt adjustment and inbuild adapter is present, this would be incomparable choice"
4,Guys This is Akshay Gireesh from Dezire 2 Tech YouTube channel I have recently purchased this monitor for my new Gaming Streaming and editing Pc build because i am building my pc with an AMD graphics card I needed a budget freesync monitor and really talking about this monitor the first thing which attracted me is its ultra slim lookThis is an exellent product the first delivery of my product wast that good as it was having an unnoticeable small white spot so i returned the product and I got a replacement within two days really Amazon's service is great .This time the product was without any single issue and working amazingly If u are on a budget then i will strongly recommend you this full HD IPS monitor for gaming and editing.Guys full review of this monitor will be uploaded whithin a week on my channel Dezire 2 Tech do check out and from there u can decide whether to place the order or not Thankyou
1,"Initially when purchased everything was good..but after 3-4 months usage it's showing problems. Frequently fluctuate. Automatic switch off and on... customer care is not as good as expected, takes too much time to resolve.Remember one thing, they don't have direct service center , they are providing warranty through third party which is F1 infosolutions and services Pvt Ltd. This company is not at all professional. Very hopeless service . Took 15 days just replace adaptor of monitor and still it's unresolved."
3,"It's a good product for its price. The picture quality is not bad but not that great either. The monitor stand is straight-up bad. it wobbles a lot.Cons :- Monitor wobbles a lot.- When overdrive mode is set to extreme, there is a lot of ghosting.- 75 hz is ok for normal gaming, but if you want to play competitively, I suggest you to go for 144hz- Brightness is way too high for my liking, even the lowest brightness is way too high for me.- White color looks yellowish. you'll have to calibrate it from windows options.- Speakers are really bad.Pros :- The monitor looks amazing. The white color making it look really nice.- 75hz is great for normal gaming. from 60 to 75, it's a big change.- There are all the cables in the box- really small bezels.I hope this review helps.Update :After just 20 days of use, bottom part of the screen started showing black/dark colors.Update :the black light is gone, by itself"
4,"The overall quality of the product is great for the price point.The brightness of the display is very bright, I had to set the brightness to 0 to get comfortable.The display has a very thin design and also very lightweight. The base of the monitor is sturdy as it is of metal.There is also a lot of options to configure the display on the monitor.Cons:The speaker of the monitor wasn't loud at all. So, I had to use the laptop speakers.You get a VGA and HDMI cable, along with an AUX cable (for sound input)."
4,"Writing this review after almost one month of usage. The is one of the cheapest 75hz monitor. It is very thin and sleek. The white color also adds to the sleek touch. The monitor supports up to 75hz and its really visible, but we cannot activate Nvidia G Sync if using an Nvidia GPU. The picture quality is also good(not the best). The downside is the audio quality. The sound is barely audible but non the less its better than nothing.In the box, the monitor comes with a power cable with adapter, one HDMI cable, One VGA and one AUX cable. The monitor comes with 1no HDMI port and VGA port. The display is crisp and not very problematic to eyes. No bleeding or other defects noticed. The monitor also can be registered online to avail support from acer. Overall a nice monitor with good display and specs."
2,"The monitor has lot white light bleeding in the lower left and right corners which destroys the black levels .Also, the bugs in the monitor firmware do not allow you properly configure the monitor . The speaker are just for namesake or we can say just hear the pop up sounds dont expect media experience from them . Buy it only if you have some budget constraint otherwise spend 1.5k to 2k extra for samsung or LG"
1,It’s 0% brightness is equal to 60% brightness on my smartphone(iPhone SE 2020). Will definitely going to hurt your eyes.
5,"A really good monitor, not sure if I could have gotten it for cheaper during special days, but it's a good monitor for work and for personal use.I've seen a few reviews talking about damaged products, but you need to understand that atleast 1 - 2% of products will be defective no matter (at production and shipping). Just hope you are not the unlucky 2%er. In case you do get a defective product, just chill and get an exchange.Don't post negative reviews if you get a defective product, get it replaced and then review."
5,Got this for office work purpose. Best monitor for both working and entertainment. Very light and thin screen and also bezel less display makes this product looks class especially white color varient. Got this for 7.9K best deal. Though it has inbuilt speaker output is not that loud but never mind you get AUX cable.Confused whether this one or BenQ... It features everything which BenQ has.. but look wise Acer scores well. Finally purchased acer and it didn't disappointed me.
4,"The monitor is really great for those who are working from home presently. Picture quality is crisp and more natural. Definitely helps reduce strain on eyes while working. But stereo speakers that are built in with the monitor are useless, you will be barely able to hear anything from it and also there's no audio out jack, so you might have to connect headset to the laptop for meetings and calls."
3,The color reproduction of this monitor is very good though there is too much back-light bleeding.I was about to use it for photo editing but due to backlight bleeding I was not getting accurate blacks. The volume is too low that the inbuilt speaker is only useful in mid-nights in a very silent environment. You need extra speakers.I purchased a LG after returning this. Paid 2 K more. No backlight bleeding. No need of extra speakers. High volume.
5,Best budget monitor for budget gamers. I purchased this for below 6000 during republic day sale and it's worth of purchase. Best looking for any setup. That 3W speaker is lound enough in quit environment. Minimal screen bleeding on complet pitch black background but you won't face any kind of of distortion in gameplay or movie watching. The sceen is anitiglare.
5,Excellent piece for this price. Speaker in the monitor is lousy but that's not exactly a fault per se. You can hook an external speaker to this monitor if you search for those options inside the menu
3,"This product is actually a Good product nice viewing angles,picture quality and all.... exempt one thing that there is screen bleeding even after replacement of the product.Product quality in slighty above average...But greatly disappointed from screen bleeding on acer..one thing only to say that this product comes manufacturer itself has screen bleeding i think....so think thrice before buying this and there is no refund tooo.."
2,"It is not a bezelless monitor. It has about a whole inch wide bezel. I have a DELL monitor from 15 years back (still working) that has almost same bezel thickness.The pictures shown here are misleading. While the bezels are thick, the actual thickness of the monitor is much narrow, as shown in pictures. Would have been better to have inch wide monitor thickness whilst the bezels be less than a centimeter thick. Do not buy if you prefer a bezel-less monitor."
4,"I am writing this review after using this monitor for 1 year exactly.**I am editing this review. ( first, I write 5star before few months but now I am facing some issue hence reducing stars)I don't play games so I can't say how this monitor performs in gaming.I bought this monitor for my design and editing/production purposes. and this monitor was very best for it until last week.Now it has started showing very strong ghosting effact hence now I can't look at the screen correctly.wherever the white area on screen is, it shows gosting/motion blur and it pain the eyes if look at that area.this is just staring hence I don't know if this effect will increase in future or not but will update this review according to it in future.another problem I found is 1 dead pixel at around middle top area of the screen and heavy backlight bleeding at dark-screen which really don't bother me for now compare to this ghosting effact. If this will increase then I have to buy another monitor because it is already hurting me while working.If I talking about good thing about this monitor then it has very good display and color quality and monitor has also slim and cool design."
4,Slim design..good picture quality. Cannot wall mount with the generic bracket.  You need non Vesa type which is ridiculous half the price of the monitor.

1,"Please don't buy this. The product which was delivered to me had clouding & backlight bleeding issue. So i decided to replace it & when the replaced product arrived, it had the same exact issue. Now I'm returning this product. Very dissatisfied. Never expected this from a company like acer."
3,"I gifted this for my dad and I just tried using this for the last 2 days, and got bad eye pain even with brightness at the lowest.. adjusted every display settings but not working at all...I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR TO ANYONE ESPECIALLY IF U WANT TO USE IT FOR LONG HOURS"
4,I purchased this monitor for my WFH setup and have been using this since one month daily for 9 to 10hrs.I am very happy after using this product.Initially I had hard time adjusting to the screen initially.Succifient brightnessGood for reading especially if you're studying or analyzing the resultsBest for watching OTT.
4,"It's a glossy white color, doesn't look as good in personal compared to as in pictures. Has 100% sRGB and 75Hz refresh rate in 1080p resolution. I choose Acer because of negative reviews of LG service centers. So far all good with the monitor."
3,"1. * Check the official website before you buy as seller provides the discount on a rate which higher then the original MRP. Making it look like a deal*.2.Watch out for screen bleeding along the edges once you have the product delivered. As the products is outdated in terms of technology as quality.3. Produces good picture quality according to various modes available on the pannnel.4. It's not for gaming, low refresh rate plus relapse on synchronisation. Buy a high refresh rate TN panel display."
1,"Hi, i bought this 3 months, now after using for 3 months the screen is turned black, no display. The product is very delicate and unreliable, please avoid if you dont want thin screen. its very delicate and unreliable, i used for 3 months now it shows black screen, At Seller : Please help its just 3 months and unsable product, please help"
3,"Happy with the monitor. Provides great value for money (₹9499. Not recommend above this price).Pros:+Slim form factor.+White color looks classy.+Easy setup.+Good color reproduction for the price.+In-built speakers.+Support for Amd free sync.+Comes with vga and hdmi cable.Cons:-Hinge design is not good. Screen wobbles very easily, even while typing.-Speakers are of no use.-Only one HDMI port."
5,"I love it man, and i use it for a video editing ,photo editing and quiet for gaming top 1 under 10,500..........,.Now it's 6 months ago i bought it and i used it daily 8 hours at least and roughly also, i rate it top 1 monitor  under 10,500 rs  budget there's no doubt on it just bring it guys it looks like 20,000 rs big high budgeted monitor its really sexy and packed it so perfect thank u soo much acer for this low bugeted beauty thank you sooo much . Before buying this monitor i visited my nearest computer store he showed me 10,000 rs third class old styled monitor ."
4,"It's too bright picture quality I feel settings are little complicated still I like the monitor because of looks , looks wise awesome go for it , speaker sound is too thin. More of treble"
5,"Beautifully designed and value for moneyWhite sleek looks big but very modern designFeatures are good,  different modes for gaming,  movies etc.75 hzs refresh rates possible.Overall superior quality at the price point.  Thanks to Amazon discount and speedy delivery."
4,"Quick Review (2 days use)1. No Backlight Bleed, No Dead Pixels noticed.2. 1080p is not enough for 27 inch. Better go for 24.3. Stock color settings didn't impress, so manually adjusted to my liking. Fairly easy job.4. Colors doesn't look that natural. Viewing angles are okay.5. Watching movies from a distance is good.6. 75Hz/Freesync does not make much of a difference. It works, nevertheless.7. Just one HDMI (cable included) & one VGA port that's it. No DVI or speaker. Not a problem for me though.8. Plug is of normal type - not bigger one like Dell/Benq - so no need to run for adapters.9. Packing was good & delivery was quick.10. MADE IN VIETNAMPrice was good, especially at this point of time - just a bit over 13k.Final word - Overall decent, but I think Dell or Benq might be a better choice. Took a while to get used to this. Better go for 24 inch. 27 inch needs at least a QHD panel.Update after 2 Weeks - Monitor working well, got used to it now. Inbuilt Color profiles/tones etc. all are useless & even irritating - there is manual mode & playing with it's settings fixed everything. Those who feel eye strain must do this. I've no such issue. However, frankly IMO, something like a Dell P series (in terms of picture quality) may be a far better choice. Also, Update the Display Driver from Motherboard manufacturer's website & turn on AMD Image Sharpening - works really well for me."
1,Eyes Feeling pain In few minutes when work on this monitor. Not able to work continuously. Color also differ for graphic designer s
4,"I pyrchased this as a secondary monitor but ended up having this as my primary display, Samsung Galaxy users this supports Samsung Dex without any additional setting, just connect your phone with a cable and you're good to go.Overall, brightness good, sharpness good, resolution impressive since it is Samsung"
5,Really good one. Built and design is great.Occupies a bit of desk space though owing to the wide legs.Perfect for a large desk.
5,"Reviewing after 2 weeks of usage.So far so good. I use it for my office work as an extended monitor.It has more than required brightness for me. I keep it in 0% brightness with night mode ON on my windows 10. I'm satisfied with this monitor. Also, it is not made in China."
5,Excellent monitor.. unfortunately I had dead pixels..Amazon initiated return at the earliest.
5,Very good ips display monitor by Samsung.
5,Best budget monitor for work from home and display quality is very nice.
5,"Its cover all your needs work, entertainment, gaming."
1,Major screen bleeding issue with this monitor
5,Good  picture  quality  and all right
5,Amazing productIt enhance our studio
5,Awsome Picture Quality......Loved it
5,Work from Home
4,The monitors are very good.
5,Good one.
5,"Main reasons I like this product :* Sturdy. Feels sturdy. Doesnt look like one of those LG/lenovo sleek models which might break anytime* This is the new model/replacement to P2419H model, so if u are reluctant wether to purchase this compared to P2419H, you can blindly go for this. As this is just the same monitor but more recent model. They both are the same, this product has less reviews coz this monitor is released on 2021 and P2419H is 2018 released hence higher number of reviews.* ZERO backlight bleeding. DELL has done a pretty good job at this* Height is adjustable. Screen is 90 degree rotatableMinor cons :* U dont get no HDMI cable - U will need to get that urself"
2,"I have been using Dell laptops for more than a decade and I trust thus brand. However the cables included with this monitor do not function. I bought two of this monitors and called up the Dell monitor queue for support. They performed troubleshooting for 30 minutes to rule out monitor issues. It ultimately boiled down to faulty cables for BOTH monitors. Dell refused to send me replament cables saying these ""cables are complementary sir, we don't replace. We can take back both your monitors and send you refurbished (used) ones.""How absurd! I refused.I called up Dell laptop support queue to see if my laptop had issues. And they told me the cables included with the monitors are NOT meant for connecting the monitor to a laptop for display! I had to spend my own money and buy HDMI cables!I can't believe Dell does this to their customers!"
5,Bought 2 units for a dual monitor setup.  I like the minimal bezel for the monitors.  Suite very well to my tabletop.This comes with 15 Amp plug.  Normal switch board do not have this.  Either you have to buy an adaptor or a 5Amp cable.  This is an additional cost and inconvenience.
4,"Superb product.It is a good monitor for WFH. This monitor comes with a 16amp power cable (input - 16amp, output - 10amp) and display port cable. It does not come with HDMI Cable, you need buy it separately if you want.The 10 amp is monitor input power spec (please do check the male power input area in the monitor).Display does not take much power until brightness is below 75%. But it has 4usb port which can be used for charging as well.Pros1. Display colours and its accuracy2. Easy to assemble3. Support for VGA, HDMI, DP4. USB upstream support, by using this option you can connect mouse, keyboard through monitor.5. Quality is excellent6. Anti-glare is working superbly7. Flicker free screen8. IPS panel is goodCons1. Needs improvement in packaging2. 16amp power cable(10amp power cable is enough for this monitor)3. Does not come with HDMI cable"
5,After much research and reading about best professional monitor for wfh I finally made my decision to purchase P2422H. Got it in 14.7k in great indian festival. Overall I am loving this monitor due to its features:-1- It is a great panel with ergonomic capability/swivel etc which is great for coding and office work.2- Panel is really bright and color reproduction is also fantastic.3- With the upstream cable I am able to connect all my USB peripherals to monitor.Overall it is a great display at this price point.
5,"Great One⭐Pros:>Height Adjustable>Rotatable>Good Colors>Easy Monitor Preferences Control using Joystick>Upstream(cable included) and sufficient Downstream PortsCons(Points to be noted):>16A Power Adapter(6A/5A is supported. You can use it, if you already own it)>No HDMI Cable included(Display Port cable included)Great for Personal and Office Works.Not sure for gaming and other editing professions."
4,After a lot of research I finalized this monitor and ordered from Amazon but as I explored the device some features were not working properly like usb ports. So after lot of online troubleshooting I contacted Dell support.  They have very kindly replaced the part and new is working as expected.  So I will recommend to buy directly from Dell.
2,This is pivot monitor which can rotate horizontal and vertical as well so good for programming.I couldn't use this item as I recieved defective monitor but thanks to Amazon they assist me to return the item.
1,Beware of this seller StorazeBiz. Sent a defective product knowingly. I could see finger prints on monitor screen after unboxing.Worst part is screen is defective showing lines
4,"I would have given 5 stars if the left & right bezels are thinner like P2319H (which I used for 3 years), start button would have been in front and instead of 16amps plug if they have given 6amps plug. Apart from above cons, the monitor is fantastic to use."
3,"As a photographer for whom post processing is important, I'm disappointed with the monitor. You think you're doing well but the end result turns out over contrasted and grungy and off color. No point trying to adjust the monitor settings. This monitor may be okay for general purpose but if you're looking to do color critical work, need to spend on something better (and probably more expensive)."
5,"The look and feel of the monitor is amazing. Dell makes its monitor with perfection. There were issues with respect to power cable (16Amp), which the seller (Jain Infoways) fixed it by going out of the way. Also for macbook one needs an HDMI cable and a usb c to hdmi converter. The seller helped me in that as well. The picture quality is amazing."
5,"Good quality, no backlight beeding, latest model comes with 6A plug instead of 16A plug. Lower Brightness level could've been reduced further to prevent eye strain in a dark room."
5,It was way too good. Everything.
5,"I am using this monitor for Film related Vfx work , where real life color representation mater most.And so far it has not disappointed me. So the monitor is doing its job very well."
5,Best professional monitor for Coding at this price range.Good Text quality.Height Adjustment.Dell Display Manager.Good picture quality.
3,Adapter doesn't fit into our normal socket. U need to purchase 6-16A adapter. I expected the USB-C port which isn't present. There is no HDMI cable.
2,60hz warning!!!!It is not 240hz don't believe. false specification its 60hz only so check it correctly and buy .
5,"GREAT MONITOR AFTER P2419HStay productive, no matter where you work. Reduce harmful blue light with this sleek 23.8-inch FHD monitor featuring ComfortView Plus technology"
5,Monitor is stunning and has excellent picture quality
5,"Hi Dear,I am very happy to buy this Monitor. Picture quality is good. I was waiting for last three months for amount to be reduced. Finally it is reduced from Rs. 9500 to Rs. 7999. Then 10% cashback offer in My AMEX card.* Picture quality is good* Looking fancy and decent design.* I was brought for this developing purpose. So now feeling good for my eyes working in late night.* HDMI Cable not available only VGA Cable.* Edges are not properly fitted. But okay."
4,"Slim and very stylish monitor. Picture quality is good. I am using macbook so cannot compare to retina display. But at this price point, I would say this is a excellent piece.The highlight is the metal stand which is stylish and sturdy. Many monitors don't have metal Base. I love the Matt finish on the stand and love the black finish.Just got it today. I will see how it goes and update my review if I see anything strange.This product is China made so had to  sterilise it before using. 😂. Just joking."
5,Best product
5,This is the best monitor I could have purchased in a decent budget. I have compared this monitor with every other branded monitor and bought it. It has all the features that a branded monitor has and is budget friendly. It comes with an almost 24 inch wide screen. This is the best find and has an HD resolution with 1980 *1980 pixels. It has a sleek design and comes in silver colour. It can be mounted on a wall or can be put on desk. VGA and HDMI cable is supported. Though the inbuilt speaker is not as good as one can expect but overall a great product from zebronics. If one is looking for a sleek and budget friendly monitor then this product should be one's first choice.
5,My Monitor is suddenly not working properly. Developed Screen resolution patch from below screen. nearly 75%. I need replacement for this. It is under Warranty.
5,"It's good for daily use.Everything is perfect with it.the design with almost zero bezel.no bleeding.But the colours are not vibrant for a Full HD display.not recommend for photo/video editing, gaming etc.best for casual daily use, reading, surfing through net,trading,movies etc.Recommend."
5,Sleek design.. White color makes more stylish.. Picture quality is awesome. Tried both as a TV and monitor.. 1) As a TV: picture quality is very much cool but In built speaker doesn't sounds good. Made only for notification sounds and not much loud.. 2) As a monitor: Blue light filter is much helpful for work from home purpose.. Perfect choice for ppl who are working from home
5,Awesome productImage quality is goodVery satisfied with the product
5,An excellent monitor for the price.  Pictures are sharp and steady at high resolution.
4,I bought this Monitor couple of days back and delivered it swiftly. Thanks for Amazon prime.Pros:Good display sizeGood picture qualityEasy setupCons:Can be provided with better speakerYou can't adjust the viewing angleOverall it's worth the price less than 8K and has a better picture quality than expected. Ran through couple of display test video from YouTube. Passed all test and HD resolution is good.Finally packaging was good small and adequate. Easy to carry for shifting purpose.
5,Good product
5,Good

5,I would say just buy it.Best qualityVery cheapAmazing
5,Monitor is osm btt some light rays comes out from the display brezzels..and electric current passes out through a screw.. value for money ....
5,Worth it.. Just by if u are a normal user.
5,Best best
5,The product is meeting the expected quality.The form factor is good.Integrate Webcam to make this product in the customer delight category.
4,"Excellent design, especially back side.Very narrow Basel and slim.Good finishing and colour, useful in offices where it is visible from backside too.In built speakers.Only one thing, all the connection sockets are backward, so wall fixing difficult.No indicator in front side."
5,monitor at a good price and its value for money
5,Goog
5,Nice 👍
1,"By comparing the 1. Pics from the product description, 2. Pics posted by other customers in the review section and 3. Pics I have attached with this review, it would be evident that the product I received is completely different. i.e the back projection is bigger than the original, stand fixing arrangements are different, shape/size and cutout in the stand are different, description on the adaptor is different.How can a product from a branded company like zebronics differ when the model no. in the product description on amazon and on the product I received is the same. This proves that clearly, I have received a duplicate/first copy products.Further, if you can see the 4th pic I uploaded, the screw hole given to fix the stand is useless, as the hole is inside the monitor body and the screw can't be inserted."
5,Gud looking clear pic quality & lowest cost worthy of purchase
4,Moniter is good one but stand is not adjustable. Screen is looking some in band position. When seating in front of screen it is very awkward position to work on monitor. My samsung monitor was adjustable. And one more thing wall mountain clamp was not received
5,*Picture quality is amazing.*superb thin Display.*Available inbuilt speaker.*Natural Colours.*Value for Money.*Just go for it.
5,Good quality
5,Nice product.
5,Best display. But if you want to buy it for speaker look for any other monitor.
5,SERVES THE PURPOSE VERY WELL AS THE PICTURE QUALITY IS UPTO THE MARK AND THE MONITOR IS REALLY VERY SLIM IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
5,Overall best
5,Awasum monitor
5,This is real zero bazal monitor very very very good monitor very good picture quality extra wide
1,Do not buy. Looting customers. Actual price is 22999. Plus there's is wireless earphones free offer. So ultimately the monitor costs 20k.Wait for the price to drop to 22k. Useless.Ban these type of sellers
1,Bought it from Kora solutions but received a defective product. Now from last 2 days following up on replacement request and seller says they can max repair the product but cannot replace or return it.I did raised this complaint with Amazon for replacement or refund. But Amazon said that they are just a courier service and work as a broker between seller and customer. If there is any issue with product they cannot help. Customer need to do whatever seller recommend. If seller says they cannot help then Amazon cannot do anything. These were the exact words mentioned by Raj N from Amazon leadership team.After multiple frustrating follow up with Samsung and seller I got money refunded.Thanks Seller for helping me with the refund
5,"Samsung Odyssey G7 is a great monitor for both gaming and watching movies and tv series.PROS: 👍1. 240hz2. 1440p resolution3. Gsync compatible4. VA panel (deep blacks are great)5. curved monitor, so you don't have to turn your head too much while sitting close. (no it doesn't feel too curved just right at the point)6. core lighting, puts less stress on your eyes in dark.7. the pixel density is about 109 PPI so it's obvious the text clarity will be good as well8. comes with two 3.0 USB slots, so you can plug your mouse and keyboard.9. It comes with HDR 600. movies, games, and series look great watching on HDR.CONS: 😌1. gets hot easily when HDR is on, you can feel the heat on your face, but having an ac room should fix that issue.2. THE PORTS ARE A NIGHTMARE TO REACH !! they are so hard to access, if you don't have a big table you'll struggle to find ports just by the feel of hands. what makes it super hard is they are not visible from the back or can be felt with a hand easily.3. Just HDR 600, HDR 600 isn't great but better than the fake HDR 400 certified monitors.4. core lighting isn't bright enough with half of the available colors so make sure to choose the bright color.5. most importantly, the stand is huge which might not an issue for big tables. i suggest a gas-powered VESA mount.6. Vulcan and HDR aren't compatible for some reason, your monitor will go blank and won't start without replugging the power cord.EXTRA: no dead pixel or any sort of faults in my unit, Bought it for 43500rs"
1,Grainy pictures and crushed blacks in dark scenes in movies or youtube videos.Good for gaming
3,"This monitor has the following issue (firmware 1011.0):When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is ON - Micro-stuttering in games when slow camera panning - like when you use a gamepad or controller to pan the scenery. This micro-stuttering is not present if ""VRR Control"" is switched OFF.When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is OFF - If frame rates go above 90 fps, then there is a lot of inverse ghosting. Cannot correct this inverse ghosting as ""Response Time"" is disabled during ""Adaptive Sync"" ON. Another issue is that even if you play 60 fps games, LFC engages at 72 fps, so a 60 fps game is actually running at 120 fps on the monitor which is in the ""inverse ghosting"" region. You can bring down the LFC lower boundary to 30 fps by CRU (see some reddit posts), so that 60 fps games do not get overshoot. But mind you at such low fps without LFC flickering issue can be seen."
5,The beast of all the Gaming monitors. You would fall in love with it and never want to go back to flat screens. The only competition it has is its G9 model which is way too expensive.G7 is the best thing you would love from your gaming rig and can fully utilize all the newest GPUs with this.It is a bit heavy but worth every penny.Kudos to SAMSUNG for this fantastic product.
5,"I use it an my daily driver for gaming, watching movies and create graphics design. The curve gives you a pretty good end to end viewing angle that makes you feel the display is all around you.Though it's price is high compared to other monitors available in the market, I'm satisfied with this product."
5,"Background:I have a decent gaming rig (RTX 3070) and was using a LG 32GK650F 32"" 1440p 144Hz VA panel with my setup. I mostly play FPS (CS, Valorant) but also occasionally play RTS (AOE2), AAA titles and consume a decent amount of video and browsing content as well. The main reasons for upgrading were: low pixel density of LG monitor (webpages and text looked awful), black smearing (I mostly use black backgrounds and boy the smearing was bad) and maybe size (found 32"" to be slightly big for FPS games).Other considerations:Considered many alternatives varying from 27"" 1440p to 32"" 4K monitors. Most of the 27"" 1440p monitors were limited to 144/165Hz and while it was not a deal breaker but it was inferior to 240 Hz anyways. I would have gone for 4K 144Hz monitors but then my RTX 3070 wouldn't be enough for 4K gaming. 280Hz/360Hz 1080p monitors were out of question because I don't play competitively at that level. HDR at this price range is just a marketing gimmick. You need atleast a 1000 nits panel with multiple local dimming arrays for a decent HDR experience. IMO HDR is mostly suited to OLED panels.IPS vs VA:Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 have the best VA panels in the world and are the fastest VA in the market beating even the top IPS panels. I mostly use black backgrounds and play in dark so VA were obviously a better choice with high contrast ratio and no IPS glow. The only thing that was bothering me was black smearing which luckily Samsung has done such a good job that it's on par with IPS panels. IPS do have better viewing angles but then again it wouldn't matter if it was a curved display in the first place. I don't share my screen so curved and slightly less viewing angles were ok with me.What's great:I got a decent panel with minimal backlight bleed, no dead pixels, no black smearing. Colours are far better than my previous LG monitor. Contrast and colours are great. Display is sharp and crisp and gets bright enough to use it in a well lit room. Out of the box display calibration was decent. Games look beatiful. The curve is aggressive and took me around a day to get used to and now I love it. I can keep the monitor close and focus on the center of screen (in FPS games) and still have field of vision in the corners. I use it on a DP 1.4 cable at 1440p 240Hz 10 bit (8bit+FRC).What's not so great:Size. The monitor is thick and the curve is to blame here. Make sure you have enough space on your desk. Secondly, the stand is just huge. It is very stable and offers every kind of adjustment but for a 27"" panel it is just plain huge. I use a monitor arm so that isn't an issue for me but it's something to keep in mind. Pricing is a hit or miss. Look for price cuts during sales. But comparing to other brands this is decently priced. Other brands like LG, Asus, Gigabyte has a huge difference in offshore and Indian pricing which I just consider plain cheating and greediness.Conclusion and recommendations: It's a great all rounder monitor albeit for a selected audience. It is highly recommended for someone who wants the best of both worlds (FPS+AAA gaming), prefers to use the monitor in the dark, isn't bothered by the curve, has enough space on desk or a monitor arm. Consumers who play eSports competetively should look for 1080p 280/360Hz monitors. And those who play on consoles or AAA games only should eye a 4K 144/120Hz display or OLED displays (especially for HDR). IPS panels for those who wants wider viewing angles and share screen and are not bothered by IPS glow and low contrast ratio. This is all from a gamer's perspective only as I don't use any productivity applications. Hope this helped you!"
5,"Everything i expected from this monitor, i got. I was skeptical at first since people mention flickering/stuttering issues, but my unit did not have those issues. 1440p 240hz at 10 bit color works fine with the included displayport cable since my 2070S has DP1.4 DSC support. No visible ghosting/smearing (regular or black level) and overshoot. HDR is pretty good with the max brightness of 600 nits and around 90% dcip3 and an upgrade over SDR (although not as good as my Galaxy Note 9, which is a self emissive display with 1000+ nits peak brightness and a wider color gamut).My only complaint is the VRR range of the monitor. Nvidia lists this monitor's range as 60 to 240hz, yet LFC seems to trigger as early as 90hz. If a game stays above or below 90fps, it's a non issue; but if a game moves constantly above and below 90fps, it's gonna be distracting since there's some stutter before the monitor moves in and out of LFC (This is evident for me when playing Doom eternal maxed out with rtx on). Not sure if this is from the monitor's side or nvidia's implementation of LFC on Freesync monitors."
1,Worst picture qualityPlease refrain from buying this monitor
5,I bought the 27’ monitor for my Xbox series X and it’s freaking amazing. Better performance than any other monitors that I used before for FPS shooter games . Great color and TN like low input performance. If you have the money just go for it . 100 % Future proofed.
4,"Black level and contract is awesome ,,brightness is very high bcoz of qled display,,overall best monitor for gaming,,,"
5,It will be produced in May 2021. The date is relatively new and satisfactory.  No abnormality was found on the screen for the time being.

5,One of the best monitor..1000R curvature is simply awesome..specially for gaming! Definitely a thumbs up! Watching movies and designing stuff is also good
5,"Very good product for gaming mashine.we are happy to buy this product.good performance in gaming sagment.Nice resolution,nice picture quality"
5,Buy 2 of these and enjoy. Only con it is not 4k monitor but their is no regret in purchasing it.
5,"The monitor is perfect for productivity, media consumption and casual gaming. Brightness is more than enough. I'm running it at just 10% brightness as I use it fairly close. Picture is sharp and crisp. While it does support HDCP, it lacks HDCP 2.2. 10 bit color is possible only in 60 Hz. It defaults to 8 bit in 75 Hz, which is a minor con. It is more than enough for 1440p gaming at 60 Hz or 75 Hz. Casual gamers need not worry. It's good enough.  The stand is perfectly functional. The placement of the cable mounts and the buttons are absolutely awful. If you can look past that, just go for it."
4,Good monitor using it from last 1 week with no issue. Picture quality is nice in this segment.The only thing i am missing i can not use wall mount desk mount stand with this monitor as back of this monitor is completely flat an no hook for mounting.Base mount is designed V shape which is leaving extra space behind the monitor. Doesn’t look nice.
5,"This is a value IPS panel (2K @32 INCHES) for the price around 22k to 24k. If you are looking for a decent monitor for productivity and normal gaming, this is a good option. The picture quality is extremely good as it is an IPS panel, though there is little bit of glow in the the edges, bottom right or left, Which again is manageable. The picture quality compensates for this shortcoming, after couple of minutes you completely forget that there is a glow, which is minimal, and only appear in extremely dark scenes. Go for it."
1,"It started malfunctioning only 10 days after delivery, viewsonic wants to provide replacement with refurbished unit, but why should I accept it if I already paid for new unit? Please don't buy it"
1,"Monitor flickers a lot. Not a good product. Service takes lot of time (shared the system details with service team on 4th oct, Still the issue is not fixed). One of the worst product that I ever purchased. One of the worst service that I have ever seen. Don't purchase this product until unless you want to screw yourself."
5,Awesome product. I m very happy to buy this. With lot of research I took it and I must say that this is the best one. Colours are perfect. Design is very premium. Must buy this.
5,Video Player is loading.
4,The monitor is really up to mark. Brightness and pixel quality is really good.. stand could have been better in terms of flexi rotations for adjusting heights and angle.. still 4 star for solving the purpose rightly.
5,"Beautiful display, looks like a work of art! Max brightness could have been slightly higher, but otherwise perfect for 1080p gaming."
5,I use it with my Macbook pro. Colours and calibration are good for a 1080 screen.
3,"its a beauty with brain ,+very slim design +IPS LED panel +27"" size +4ms response timealmost perfect for my need.But very fragile mine broken,asked for replacement of panel to viewsonic , it is 80% of the product."
3,Dislike. Too bright and got eye strain in one week time. I need to adjust the brightness often.
5,So far there is no issue. Do not expect to have one. We have been using Viewsonic produts for many years and their service has been excellent and that is the reason selected this particular model as a monitor for doing photography related work
5,"A piece of art!Shouldn't expect hell lot out of this budget but if expect a monitor with good colors, contrast,and sharpness this is the perfect choice!"
5,Certainty a value For money product and it’s 75hz refresh rate display makes it seem to make it even more worthThe thin edges makes the design look very sleek and nice and fits in any room perfectly.
5,"if only it was 4k, but 2k and response time is great. The picture quality is great and the speaker as expected is below par."
5,Good product with options to change modes and view settings. Screen can also be tilted a bit.
5,The best monitor for its size.. price and specs..Do buy yourself a  really good set of speakers along with this... You won't regret it.
1,Don't buy dont
1,When we use the monitor it turns on and off by itself... every couple of minutes.. Worst monitor stay away from this product
5,Nice product...
3,I am using MacBook Pro 2020. The monitor works perfectly with Windows and Linux But display is blurry with MacBook Pro.

3,"An excellent monitor with limited functionality due to wrongly advertised 120/144Hz which is strictly over DP1.4 and HDMI is 2.0, i.e 60Hz is the last you can achieve over HDMI. PS5 and xBox will be limited to 60fps due to HDMI 2.0. If you use a RTX which supports 4-144Hz using 2 DP 1.4 cables or 4K@120 using one DP 1.4 cable and a supporting source. Using HDMI 60fps is the last you can reach even if your source is 120fps, which is my case. The model which is CG437k S has HDMI 2.1 and is the superior model which is yet to be released. This listing which is CG437k P is being sold while advertising for CG437K S. So choose carefully, this overpriced purchase is definitely a regret i have to carry, thanks to Amazon"
1,"Simply waste for gaming.hdr is ugly,somuch screen tearing.you cant read any text totally not worth for gaming"
4,Great on all perspective except one.Its screen is not true 1ms GTG. 1ms VRB doesnt reach true 1ms. Tried with single display port cable and two display port cables but still the same. True 1ms is never reached.
5,Predator CG437K Good Product Good Praise
5,I personally love it and its worth the money.pros:- 120 Hz Monitor- Gsync- Big size and workspace- good color production- RGB lightsCons:- buggy light sense application- bulky agronomics- require a big space- buggy
5,This is a great monitor for the price your paying. But before buying a pc check that if your pc is good as the monitor. Because if you don't have a good PC then buying this would be waste of money and your time.I brought it because I was a ryzen 9 3950x  which is a 16 core 32 thread processor and I am having a dual RTX 2080ti setup and 128 gb ram. That is why to unlock the full potential of my pc I bought this monitor
4,It’s my dream monitor going to buy this monitor next month😃Edit: So I have purchased this monitor everything was good but I received only one DisplayPort cable I checked unboxing videos in yt they got 2 DisplayPort cables overall monitor was good and the monitor design is awesome
5,"It is so superb monitor! If you have more money, you should definitely buy it!😍 It looks so good and futuristic! Nice! Thank you!"
5,"I bought this monitor in October 2020, so I've been using it for over 3 months now and I have to say the monitor is amazing!SIZE - At 43 inches this monitor is going to be really rare, not many would prefer such a huge monitor and yes a monitor at this size and price point will make 90% of the population to wonder if it really is of any use. Well this is only for those that have a huge place like a room and a separate table just for the PC. This will be a perfect replacement for those looking to buy a 49 inches curved monitor. The 49 inches ultra wide has a height of only 13 inches and hence the display view gets cut majorly but with this 43 inches you get a height of about 23 inches and hence games or whatever that your looking at will look much better and will feel for immersive.GAMING - This is the best part about this monitor. I've had many monitors and TVs connected to my PC but trust me none of them even comes closer to what this monitor provides. This is a colour calibrated monitor which means the colours are very close to reality. There are several viewing modes that come with the monitor - Graphics, HDR, Standard, Racing each of these modes have different settings and look different. You can even customize your own preferences and store it under a mode called ""User"". If you have a high end pc that can support 4k gaming at 50-60 fps then there is nothing better than this monitor to view those games. The HDR support on this monitor is brilliant games and movies look very realistic. The level of detail that you will notice on this monitor is to a level that u even wonder at times if those levels even existed before. You definitely have to experience it to really understand it.NORMAL USAGE - Even if you are a causal gamer and a normal PC user you will still enjoy the amount of area this monitor provides. Even at 1080p games still look very good. Only problem is that you definitely need to sit atleast 4 feet away from the screen and hence it definitely requires a huge setup.RGB LIGHTS - I've read many online reviewers complaining about the RGB strip lights that are provided with the monitor (4 strips are provided - 2 long ones and 2 short ones), but I really don't think its an issue. You can always stick those rgs lights with 2 sides tapes onto your monitor or if you have a metal table like me the strips are magnetic it will just hold onto it. And these lights look absolutely amazing. Syncing it with games is literally impossible but you can sync it with music being played and also there are many customizable options that come with the acer light sense software.PRICE - i bought this monitor for 98k which i think is a very good value for money, I mean honestly it is a huge monitor with all the highest specs available for a monitor at this stage and definitely it is not going to be cheap. There are 27-32 inches monitor that are almost the price of this one with similar specs on it and hence I really think 1 lakh for this monitor is pretty decent. Definitely it is a premium monitor but for what it offers I really think the price is justified for the whole package (looks great, performs fantastic, is hugeeee, RGB strips)SUMMARY - Overall it is an amazing monitor if your gonna use it for gaming(nothing even comes closer to this experience none of the other monitors), even for regular usage it definitely is great. At times this was available for as cheap as 92k for which I really think you should just buy it if your looking for a big screen. This monitor will definitely not disappoint you."
1,"The problem is in the picture clarity. The left half is absolutely excellent but not on the other side, some yellowish color which dulls the monitor. Have called LG Customer care for service and awaiting his presence to sort out this issue. If not I will soon return the product.Update: The service person convincing that it is nature quality of the light reflected which appears in white background. Yes, couldn't able to find any yellowish while playing videos. But, still it looks awkward. I usually work with white background software where I do not prefer this rile thing. I'm returning this LG monitor. Thanks to LG and Amazon for this awful experience.Replaced Product Update: Now Amazon making me not to buy their products.1. Seal is broken and revamped.2. There is a bulge/ bump in the frame of the screen.Returning this frustrating product. And I want my money back.I think this is my last purchase from Amazon.@Amazon, Don't play with LG brand, LG has lost one loyal customer because of you."
5,"This is a good 1080p monitor at this price:i have purchased it @8199 during sale, and i feel it just worth it considering the price the product is well build comes with max 2 years of Warranty do read all the warranty related information on LG website or on the warranty card>the Monitor comes with a HDMI port, by default i remain on 60Hz but if u want u cant take it upto 75Hz (u need a AMD card running on HDMI with AMD free sync On)colors are pre-calibrated but the coverage is only 75% of the color gamutcontrast ratio is also goodDont Get Confused about this Monitor This is a IPS LED montior Not LCD as its written on product name(for a moment i got confused with that)It is not entirely bezel less there is a small bezel but its  doesn't looks bad!if you are planning to buy this monitor go with!Hope these informations would be helpful to you all.. !"
5,"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.Pros:1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).4. Minimal bezel at the edges.5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.Cons:1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.Two things to take note of:A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowingB. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now."
5,"Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. You get an HDMI cable too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable and budget range Full HD LED Monitor.Cons:1. Glossy plastic back and stand finish attract lot of fingerprints2. Stand can only tilt, there is no height adjustment or rotation feature3. Only one HDMI Port4: No Speakers and USB port"
5,"The whole box comes with plastic visible wrapper. So the shipping was awesome in 1 days delivery. However inside the box 1 monitor, 1 stand neck , 1 base stand, 1 cable management clip, 1 HDMI cable, 1 driver cd,  and some documents comes. No vga cable . Hence can use your old one. The base stand's design is awesome with half circle shape.  Made inside with aluminium  finished with hard glossy black plastic. The stand neck and the back side of the monitor also has glossy plastic finish. Back side there 5 ports including vga port named as D-SUB and HDMI port. So I connected my monitor via vga cable cause I have no HDMI port. however ther are wall hanging option too at back. Front side the whole 16:9 ration screen has very narrow literally invisible bezel but when  you will switch on the display you can notice very thin bezel at 3 side while the bottom has normal brezel with LG logo and only one joystick switch (Lg likes joystick ) . The resolution of the monitor is pure Full Hd with IPS cinema panel . The panel quality is A++ with very accurate real color production and this is the feature of the IPS panel. IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen.  LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed  or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular. I damn gurantee that you will not regreat after buying. Also this monitor is protected by Lg's manufacturing warranty. I got this monitor at  Rs 6800 with card instant discount. So thanks amazon and thanks seller and thanks LG . Hit Like if you have liked this preview"
1,"Product is good. But after 2months of purchase my monitor is showing vertical green line at right side. And I have to go to service center too soon.  And they told they replace panel, whether I don't know they replaced panel or not. Then they called me after 3 days to take my monitor. And the problem was solved. And again after 3 months I faced same problem and took to service center they are simply saying water damage. And this won't come under warranty. And they showing only photo of monitor panel which is good. And they are telling they'll charge for that. And I never wiped my monitor with dry or wet cloth then how could this happen. And I even know that's not water damage. They simply want to charge money from me. And I'm never gonna buy any lg products anymore.one of the worst customer center is lg. Its better to go with dell monitors"
1,"<<dishonest Seller/LG>>  THEY ARE SENDING RENEWED PRODUCT AT NEW BUYING.I'm saying this because the display panel (i.e. LCD panel) changed to lower quality panel. At the display resolution 1920 X 1080  @ 75 Hz the blue color (color code #0078d7) looks pixelated and if the refresh rate is reduce to 60 Hz this problem almost gone. This thing happen when the panel mismatched with the controlled board.I asked to monitor technicians and other who also repair monitors, they have same opinion.I saw this monitor at our local computer shop and my friends also buy this same model from local shop. But the monitors from local shop has a grate picture quality and less back-light bleeding (barely noticeable ). And no pixelated blue color.There is no option for No Star rating, so I've to given one Star.I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. Because the response time is about 10ms on normal settings.About 5ms is possible by turning on the faster mode but there is too much inverse ghosting. And that will be a bad experience of gaming.Also beware of LG service at Westbengal region. According to their warranty policy the product can't be replaced only repaired. And the service person can't do anything except changing the service date.(In my case I called for the upper bar glowing problem but the service person, instead of coming to my house he solved the problem by himself. Yes , the person send a problem solved massage to LG against my complained without coming to my house, without seeing the problem with monitor. That was his supper power)"
5,The very first thing I loved about this monitor is that its color calibrated. Not many monitors are. The first monitor I received took a beating during shipping and had a horrible backlight bleed. The second one was good and has no backlight bleed issues. The display quality is fantastic. The color is uniform and there is no flicker. There is a bit of IPS glow just like any other IPS panel. Navigation using the joystick is a breeze. I paired it up with my PS4 and everything has been smooth sailing. Just remember that if you notice backlight bleed after buying this monitor get a replacement asap. No one is mentioning about backlight bleed here and just accepting it as if it's a common defect.
1,"So the monitor stop working after 2 days of use , it was good until 2days but after that it become a trashSo I got a replacement for the monitor laterGuess whatIt's was not working eitherAnd now I got a another replacementIt was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experienceThe Amazon services suckI really wanted a refund I don't got itTip: for buying monitorDon't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitorFor gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panelUsually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fpsFor gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games  go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic cardBuy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budgetVa panel is a compromising option between ips and TN panel"
5,"I expected it to be good.. But when it came, I opened it and plugged it in..  then I was just delighted with happiness..Believe me it's the best panel under 10k budget.. Many of friends have different types of monitors .. but when it comes to picture quality.. This one is at the top of the list ..The color reproductions are outstanding..75hz , free sync , alsmost borderless display and most importantly IPS panel and yes the best IPS panel in the segment..No bleeding issue..I didn't notice IPS glow..Blacks are pure blacks..But only minimal problem is that it can not be tilted backward..Don't be panic going through negative reviews.. I will give it 10/10 on the price"
5,"Video watching is very impressive and it wont disappoint movie lovers. It can be also useful to beginner level editors. Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.Screen split feature is included in the on screen control. You can split the screen and assign different tasks on those. You can choose between many layouts, it can be life saver for web developers and few other professionals. While multitasking you can open PIP and play your favorite media in any part of the screen. Overall the on screen software is very simple to use while very useful. t performed exceptionally well compared to its budget. i will recommend LG22MP68VQ-P monitor for gamers, photo and video editors, web developers and professionals specially for those who are looking for a good monitor and tight on budget."
3,"The monitor is very nice overall with a matte finish and 3 side narrow bezel. Excellent product if you want to mount 2 next to each other.I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor. Don't know what is causing this but since I only changed the monitors and nothing else, I assume it is the monitor."
5,"This monitor size is not adequate for 1080p resolution if you are working for 8hours continuously daily for example for working from home. I initially started with 100% scaling for 1080p but I found the fonts a little small and finaly ended up to 115% scaling which is the sweet spot. So I feel a 1080p need 24 inch monitor for a pleasant experience.Also just begining of the pandemic at dec2020 I brought for 8.2 k, but now it is 12k which is unethical pricing practice. Colors are average, but antiglare is good. So this is good for light word work etc, not good for coding all day long due to to size.One advantage is that this is light weight and portable. I was able to carry it when I was traveling to my native and inlaws native places, during the work from home opportunities due to corona.This is not a perfect monitor for me. Just average. It has only one hdmi port, NO DVI port so price should not be 12k and all. 7k 8k is an ok price I feel. Also mrp is 11k and I brought for 8k from same Amazon seller, how come the seller quoting more than 11k now. Loot."
5,"Very good for the price range I got this one for 6400RS in great Indian festival sale. Very good for development purpose. Matt finish is good, not recommended for photo editing"

5,"Been using this monitor for over 6 months and I think it was the best in it’s category.For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050  Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.I’d give it a 8.5/10I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would’ve been amazing.Please click helpful if you liked my review :)"
1,"Monitor stand poorly designed with forward tilt, little jerk and monitor fell flat on the front panel, screen damaged is damaged and gone forever..thin bezel is not good for strength of the panel..I only buy Dell monitors which are robust, went for this seeing the review.Even display quality is not that great, too bright. May be good for games but not for regular viewing."
5,One of the best monitor you can get under 10kI got it under Rs 8999 so it was a great dealPros :Matt finish no reflectionVery slim bezelsEasy assemblyYou can adjust it verticalCons :It requires drivers to be installed no plug and play.There was no amazon cardboard box the bill was pastes on the box of lg in which the monitor came and the serial number is not readable.But you can easily find them on lg product website under support sectionI'm currently using it with my laptop and it is a big upgrade from it's small 15.6 inch screen and 720p resolution

2,"I gave 2 star Just because of Vertical Red line on the screen, otherwise, its worth to buy under 10K.I received my order on 2.9.2019, unfortunately there's some problem in the screen.I think it need to install Monitor driver. after installing monitor driver still having the same problem.. i change the cables, still its not working.. So, i ask for replacement."
2,"Hi,They say multi-screen display but this is not active with this product. My need was that but after observing its not supported its dis-appointing and but adv says it on amazon page....Like this many other features are missing. Please be careful on your needs on this costly monitor of 8,899.00Rs.Also, as per description they say ""1 Headphone Port"" which is not true. Please correct it amazon.no usb port very big disappointment at this price.Thanks"
4,"I bought this monitor for my PS4 console. The picture quality produced by the monitor is amazing as it has IPS panel. The display is also anti-glare with mate finish.It has only 1 HDMI port,1 VGA port and 1 DVI port.And also 1 aux port for audio."
4,"Monitor is good but it's software doesn't work in windows environment when connected with VGA cable, need to check with HDMI cableSoftware works perfectly in Macbook when connected with HDMI cableAppears like technically VGA cable doesn't support/provide two way communicationSometimes when I remove macbook from HDMI and connect windows laptop with VGA cable then it does not recognize input signal and need to manually select input device."
4,"Bought it for 7,999/- including cashback and allBringhtness control & contrast control is just perfect.Colors look quiet well.Blacks are  very clear in movies and games.No need to change settings for CSGO.Reader mode is also good but i just change contrast and brightness to suit me.Viewing angles are goodThat cable holder is very useful.And color calibration is seems good to me.Edit: cable holder is not that sturdy,Have some driver issues, screen tearing while playing videos and games at 60fps of higher"
5,This monitor is one of the most recommended for those who want a good quality gaming/multimedia monitor at a budget price. It has Freesync so when paired with an AMD GPU you get stutter free gaming. IPS panels are gorgeous and visuals look stunning. Bezels are very thin and the anti glare coating is a nice additionCons:1. No Display Port (So no Freesync via Nvidia cards)2. No height adjustable but supports VEGA mounts
5,"It's great for gaming as well as watching media.. It's a great entertainment device..All u need is speakers when watching movies and u are all set..great response time, colour production and picture quality.. The bezeless design makes it stand out from it's competitors.."
5,"This an excellent monitor, recommended buy.I am using it with my laptop and not tried for gaming.So far it gives very good picture quality, brightness, contrast and all.Anti glare is great, works well on most of the conditionsCute look with 3 side thin bezels.Good for watching movies.Haven't tried gaming, so I cant say about it.Thanks to the great and efficient delivery from Amazon"
4,"Had some great expectations .1.Was aware of the fact that it's a TN panel monitor. Viewing angles are poor , but when seeing the monitor straight on , it's nice to use.2. It's having few modes like gaming mode , reading mode and manual RGB filtering. These are just some brightness changes as far as I've seen.3. It's good for viewing content or office purpose. Does not satisfy it's gaming monito tag.Get this monitor if you're in a budget or if you're looking to get a display for your second pc. Else stay away."
4,Review on the day of delivery:-1. Good packaging (including power cable and HDMI cable)2. Easy to install3. Awesome picture quality4. Very big and bright screen.5. Awesome controller (joy stick)Working very fine but only thing is viewing angle that I can't complaint on it knowing it's a TN panel monitorRecommend:- The cheapest gaming monitor in this price range.Note:- Don't buy this monitor if u need good viewing angles or if it's price goes above 7k better to go with IPS then.
4,"Picture clarity is good, but viewing angle is horrible. No speaker available in this monitor.Pros. Full hd, hdmi, 1ms response,  75hrz, game sync technology.Cons. Viewing angle, built quality,  LG brand."
2,"I bought this monitor in freedom sale, getting it under 7000 rupees. I was already aware that another LG IPS monitor 22MK600M has this issue with solid blue shades where it displayed fine lines. But to my ugly surprise it's there on this model as well. It turns out LG uses same panel across their budget monitors. I sit at least 2 feet from my monitor, yet I can still see it on default windows 10 wallpaper. Anything static blue is a pain to look at. Solid shades of blue are never going to be dispayed correctly.I have tinkered with settings, the only way I could get rid of it was to turn reader mode on which made the display very yellowish defeating the whole point of having an IPS panel.  Furthermore, I also did manual color profiling, changed gamma - it made no difference.If you are into photo editing STAY AWAY FROM ANY LG BUDGET MONITOR.I cannot show it through pictures, it is something you'd see with your naked eyes and it is indeed very noticeable.Giving 2 stars because of viewing angles and 75HZ refresh rate as the experience is very smooth.I will probably wait for a few days and see if I could get used to it, it's an eyesore to me right now. I don't notice it in games, but I do see it a lot whenever I'm watching anything with static blue. It is just not a good panel.I regret not buying the Samsung one while it was in stock.Gonna check for a few days, if I can't get used to it I'll ask for refund."
5,The delivery is fast that the product got delivered within 18 hours. The 22 inchs monitor feels huge in terms of size and offers features that suits a casual gamer. It's 75hz refresh rate and free sync offers smooth gaming experience when paired with a Amd GPU. Coming to the panel it's decent in its price segment but not the best one in the market. Overall this monitor satisfies.
4,"I didnt really care about monitors before.As long as I could see the game running in the screen I was good to go.I had a real crap monitor before,so after using this one,I can really see the change.I can finally watch onii-chan yamete in good quality.But this monitor is supposed to be 75 hz and when I opened nvidia control panel,it showed 60 hz(I will post a picture).Dont know if its actually 60 hz and they scammed me or I need to change some settings to make it 75 hz.Either way,I could not be bothered because I'm too lazy.Overall a good monitor and if u were using a bad monitor before,u can see the change.Cheers.."
5,"This is a good product and loved it! The color tones are good and I cannot comment on the gaming performance as I do not use this monitor for gaming. This is an excellent buy!However, the HDMI cable was missing in the box and I had to purchase it outside for Rs. 400. But, the best thing about Amazon was that Amazon refunded the 400 Rupees I spent on the HDMI cable when I reached out to them for support. This was an awesome support by Amazon."
1,HDMI port is not connect pc showing pc arthing power saver mode I try various time to customercare team but no one is responding. S  products quality is not good attached image for your reference also warranty card not signed and stamped by seller. Poor quality from seller please don't waist your money.
1,"Worst and horrible viewing angle, all connection slots are on just Center back of Monitor,  no VGA cable,  if you plug the cables in the back of Monitor you will feel sinking like flesh of a dead rotten fish, no display always as the switch for cables are on back of delicate Monitor,  you can't tilt the monitor,  also adjustment panels are worst to adjust,  the mounting stand absolutely doesn't keep the monitor in fixed or stable position,  rather tilting forward as if it will fall. The built quality is worst for this price of 7k approx, screen flicking repeatedly, I extremely apologize and regret I didn't buy Ben Q Monitor which I previously bought from Amazon,  I choose it just because the seller was delivering very short period, this is first day of purchase thinking I would try to return within limited time of horrible 10 days return policy and that too doubtful. HDMI cable does not work."
4,"I bought it primarily for the two HDMI ports. I can use it with my laptop and Fire TV stick without having to change the cables. I mis-understood the description on screen split. You cannot have two views on the screen. It is more about how to use multiple monitors to get split screens. Initially, I was concerned with the audio output since volume was very low, until I found the volume control. Pretty decent output. Single button or joystick to enable and use the screen menu."
2,"The only and noticeable issue is colours look lifeless.But what is point of this product when you already have 22MP68VQ, which looks more vibrant, have better design and have almost same features even it is 4 years old now.I trusted LG that they must have made improvements over old products which are really good but LG disappointed me.Most bad thing you can't return only replace."
5,The resolution is sharp and the 75 fps allows for a more seamless gaming experience. You initially need to install the drivers but that is not an issue. The best part is the on screen management software which allows dividing the screen into mutiple zones - each zone capable of running a different programme. Delivery was fast and secure. A quality product at affordable price.
1,"I read lot of good reviews about this and purchased. But very much disappointed with the screen. I know it was TN panel before buying, i thought for programming that won't be an issue. But this one is not at all good. It has a lot of backlight bleeding. My eyes were irritated and started paining. I thought it may be an unit issue, so i placed replacement again i got the same issue. It is not an unit issue, it is a panel issue.Apart from this, seller was very quick. They delivered replacement also fast. Return also fast. Yes i returned this one. But gudos to seller."
5,"If you’re coming from a HD to FHD, this monitor is going to amaze you. The picture quality is pretty sharp. Used it with PS4 too and let me tell you the photos do not do the monitor justice and a 75hz refresh rate with 1ms response is just the perfect cherry on top. If you are a first time PC builder and on a budget GO FOR IT, it won’t disappoint you. The picture quality is amazing even from 6-7Ft."
1,"The product which I received, is not good. It has various problems.1. Sometimes, electric earthing problem occurs even though the Electricity supply lines are stable. This can be verified using a regular tester.2. Within 6 months of purchase, I am having various difficulty in seeing the picture...I used to write some programs for long hours... and I seem to experience eye problems when using this product...May be the product I had received is very bad...The problem is, I purchased it 2 times.The violet screen problem occurs...sometimes, the Electric short circuit problem occurs...The back light feature cannot be controlled at all ...  this is a major defect ... as it will have a higher level brightness associated...After using this product for many hours, THE eye CONTRAST screening capability reduces sharply....Hence my suggestion is, go to a shop and buy monitor after thorough verification...."
5,lol picture quality awesome very good picture quality I love this ❤️ this quality low price this monitor around 7k but 1 problem I see some heating this monitor only one problem testing on soon I add more details.... this monitor you can use gaming 75hz and others work no problem....Test results Heating problem automatically solve now no heating problem and picture quality ok no problem paying game good quality pictures nice 👍 if you think buy good monitor and to price low then go buy this monitor ...This monitor ips panel gaming + watching movies very good 7k price..... if you think only gaming then Tn panel it low 6k price only offer time price...
5,This moniter is an absolute bad boy...Extremely clear...No stuttering...Comes with Radeon Free sync (I have an RX 550 GPU it works beautifully)...And the 4 ports make it seem like an actual TV..On a budget and looking for a TV? Go for this Bad boy..
1,At start it seems tat the product is great..but after continous use of +2hrs...bluriness comes in...u see that ur text in black has extended shadows...My product was replaced and even the replaced product had the same issue..
4,"The monitor is working good. But there is some software or hardware error found which is corrected after adjustment. The one error is in the alignment of display towards right side of the screen and gap in left side of the screen. This was adjusted by setting the display setting.- Usually alignment of display for all side setting set at 50 means at center between 1 to 100. But the horizontal alignment in setting was set at 55 towards left then the screen/display is adjusted to the center.  As the screen what is set was saved and remained in 55 horizontal alignment  and there is no need of setting every time, I adjusted with what ever the monitor that received.The packing was not proper shows that the pack was removed before and repacking done to deliver again.Overall the monitor is working fine and using everyday. Setting and features of the monitor is good. HDMI connection is working well. The view angle of the monitor is good even at 160 degree."
4,My Concern was successfully connecting and extending my screens to this monitor from my Macbook Pro and Surface 2 Laptop both which are doing good so far with a very specific HDMI Dongle meant for these latest laptops I purchased after trying several HDMI VGI connectors and ending with one latest available in Amazon.comDont know the long term performance and upcoming Summer whether this monitor can withstand temperatures above 30- 40 DegC
3,Did not use the product. Openned the box and was not happy with the shape of monitor. It is too rectangular. Does not give a good look and closed the box asking for cancellation.The image shown in site did not give me the actual shape of the monitor. This is like showing new 10 rupee note and delivering  old (I mean the dimensions. Dont know how else I can describe this better.. apologies)
3,"The Monitor looks good. The package was packed good. The CD that came with the package is scratched and was outside without any cover. The HDMI cable packed inside the anti-static cover was damaged (you can see the silver wire inside the insulated black cable in the picture). I accidently touched it and got electric shock. Also, the invoice copy (in paper) was not attached with the package or found inside the package. Asked only for the replacement of HDMI Cable, but the customer support executive said that they have the option to only replace the whole monitor along with the cable and assured that this time no damaged items would be delivered. So, applied for replacement.Very frustated to replace the whole package for just one damaged HDMI Cable."
5,Very delicate monitor for a 12k product from LG taking its customers for a ride.  Looks and works like an OKAY product to be used as monitor.Long term review after few months of usage if it works well..Apart from being very delicate .. everything else is superb abt the product .. am not a gamer so cannot say on how games will play on this screen but for normal day to day work and movies its simply superb
5,Arrived in a good packaging. Comes with a HDMI cable. I bought the IPS one. Picture quality is awesome. Refresh rate is 75hz only when u connect through HDMI (VGA limited to 60hz).Many of you will come across reviews where people are complaining that IPS monitor having BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ISSUE.  Basically all IPS Monitors bleed but only when you will wake your monitor... i.e. when you power on it or some similar actions like that. But once your monitor is ON there will be no compromise on picture quality and then there will be no BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ISSUE! So relax all ips monitors bleed a little only when they are partially powered on.
1,"Seller not mentioning serial number in the invoice. Monitor got faulty within 20days and replacement is within 10days, when I reported this problem to LG service they are asking for the invoice with serial number. I have reported the issue and its been over a month and still not got the invoice with serial number."
1,"A very bad product if compared to Samsung in the same price range.The warranty clearly denies if you have up to 14 dead pixels that too if they are seperated, if you have continuous dead pixels it will be counted as one. Ridiculous!Cons:1. No warranty for Dead pixels and white heat spots2. Heating issues.3. Will not show true colours.4. Panel fading.Pros:1. Went to Himalayas but did not find one."
5,"Great value for money (got for 6.9k) compared to other monitors. Decent color reproduction. Anti glare, dual hdmi. Another nice thing is, separate power adapter given, so no heat inside monitor, so there is no holes in backside of monitor. Monitor fully molded, so better dust proof. No support for settings profiles, but not a big deal. Overall nice buy."
1,Picture quality is not good.1. Colors are not sharp. White color seems to be bleeding in everywhere2. Text is not sharp. So won't recommend this for office work.You can very well see difference in quality between this and your laptop screen. Also I have BenQ monitor. Difference is quality is glaring.I tried playing with setting and picture modes and nothing worked.Not worth more than 5k.
5,"Got this to supplement my work from home office setup. Great way to work on excels and read through and make presentations. It is very helpful when you are having virtual meetings when you want to share your screen but also have a look on who all are on the meeting. It also has a reading mode where the display colours change to a reddish tone, this makes it much easier on the eyes when you are working long hours."
1,"The product is very delicate. Just after 6 months of use the screen discolouration happened and i am not able to use the screen. There is not outward scratches, cracks or anything that suggest that any damage was done. When we checked with the LG technician, he said there is a crack inside the screen and it will cost almost the same cost as the price of the product if we do repair. Also this is not covered under warranty.When we told that we have not done any damage to the screen, he said that we cannot do anything and we need to pay the price of repair.Why do we have the warranty when we cannot use it when the product goes bad and that too without any damage done by userI am REALLY VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product and the brand for the way the warranty was treated and we were asked to pay the price"
5,"-> simply awesome, I got it at 6500 bucks in amazon sale.-> The monitor settings are easily accessible.-> Bezels are somewhat wide, but IPS panel backs it out, viewing angle are too good-> It has got 2 hdmi ports, power rating is 19W adapter-> display has also got energy saving option and picture mode, i usually use 'reader mode' which is suitable while working-> audio controls can be easily accessible too if speakers are connected to aux port.-> Hdmi cable was provided in the box"
1,"The picture quality and pixels on this monitor is terrible. I just received it today and I cannot look at the screen for more than 5 minutes. Upon calling amazon or LG I received no help or support. The service manager, Vishnu, was extremely unhelpful and kept interrupting me to a point where I had to ask him to let me speak. Extremely dissatisfied with the product which doesn’t meet it’s stated standards and the after sales service from amazon. Never purchasing anything again"
2,"Namaste. The accompanied CD is not displaying any manuals except some content headings. Further, somewhere in the CD displaying that the CD is meant for USA only. On the cartoon was written as compatible with ""ON SCREEN CONTROL"" features but I couldn't come across any such feature. I did not operate the push button given in the bottom, not knowing what is that for BECAUSE there are no instructions manuals. Please guide me how to use ""on screen control"" mode and also provide me with compatible CD, manuals etc., Thanks and regards."
2,"I needed for my WFH. Everything looked normal but it didn't suited my eyes. Got headache watching it. Before this too i had another LG 20m35 model. On this with 1920 res i tried 59, 60,75 frequency. For all, all looked good but none suited me."
5,I think I am the first one who writes the review about this moniter in india ... It's super awasome got it for 6.5k in Amazon sale ... No negative reviews yet ... Outstanding moniter in this price ... 22 inch IPS panel with 75hz and 5ms ... What's else do u need for this price ...It has 2 hdmi and one vga and moniter has tilt option and wall mount ... Simply 10/10
5,i got this monitor on my birthday in january 2021 and its october currently and i have to say im impressed i havent gotten any issues so far it worked well both with my ps4 and laptop. the different modes are also pretty cool. the only thing i didnt like or well is a slight criticism is that the stand that comes out of the box is slightly low so if u are planning to buy this then invest in a wall mount it would make the experience better. otherwise even after 10 months of daily 6hrs use(most of the days) there were no dead pixels or any sort of thing. ps this doesnt have speakers so if u want sound get good speakers too
3,Build is bit flimsy even for this price. More of a cost cutting solution than a low price solution. My wife's benq is better at the same price range. Though it is also not bad.
5,"Review:Colours -- 5/5Viewing angles -- 4.5/5Brightness -- 5/5Resolution -- 5/5Play GTA5 on it and absolutely enjoy the experience.Mounting and installation of the monitor is very smooth.Would highly recommend to everyone!PS -- Got it on a sale price of Rs 6,899, which feels like an absolute steal."
5,"Got this master piece 3 days back for Rs 6600. At this price this monitor proves to be the most satisfactory one.Pros:1. Comes with HDMI, VGA and 3.5mm audio output jack - cannot expect more at this price2. Manual as well as on screen controls for changing monitor settings3. Volume also can be adjusted. 30 percent volume itself is good enough in headset.4. Viewing angle perfect as mentioned in description5. Screen extension and duplication works perfect6. Reader mode is the beauty. Already the monitor has anti glare screen. Reader mode makes it further more comfortable.Cons:Nothing so far, only improvement could be placing the manual setting button in front instead of below screen.Packing and delivery was superb by Amazon."
3,"Horrible viewing angle. I had a samsung monitor(TN panel) which has better viewing angle than this one. The stand is not good it cannot be adjustable, in this budget we can expect atleast an adjustable stand( my samsung monitor which was worth rs. 4000 has an adjustable stand). Picture quality is average, disappointments are there. Build quality is also not good. So the overall price is too high. You can spend 1k or 2k more and have a good monitor."
2,I am using Dell monitor which is 8 years old and recent one HP monitor which is 2 months old.  When compared to these 2 the lenovo monitor doesn't meet the expectation.  There's no sharpness on the monitor. Tried with all the setting but it seem to be very bright or contrast and not able to get the right sharpness.  The plastic quality of the monitor is too thin to handle.  The logo in front is out of proportion to the monitor size.Overall not satisifed for the price paid.
5,"I wanted a bazel less, fullhd monitor  which has comfortable viewing angles , Found this for cheap(rs.6200) but the quality of this product looks premium. Fully satisfied with this monitor. The Image quality is very good. I was expecting a HDMI Cable with it, But it was not there."
4,"Purchased this monitor for around 6k. I use it for media consumption and web surfing, and performance has been good in these areas. Colours are well reproduced, and the monitor itself is easy to assemble. The narrow bezels (except for the bottom) means it's nice to look at too. Contrast and brightness are somewhat lacking compared to more expensive monitors, but the price tag justifies this. There's no HDR support either. You will need a HDMI cable, since only a VGA cable is included in the box.This is a monitor for someone with few requirements and fewer rupees in their account. Gamers, media editors and enthusiasts may want to look elsewhere."
1,I’m writing this review after a use of 6 monthsThe display is okay for the price and works fine. Quality of display is also good for the priceBut in 4 months time i started getting shocks on my laptop connected to the display. On further inspection the electrician found the culprit was this display.They have 3 years warranty but the service only happens if you get the display to their service center or mail it to them. And its a pain in the a$$ to deal with their service Center executives.A good product otherwise might be the piece i got was faulty. But a salty experience nonetheless.
4,"Got it today. I was a little disappointed with the packing. It was very ordinary, the seal was also broken. But thank God, nothing happened to the monitor. I am quite impressed with the physical structure of the monitor, just that the stand looks quite outdated. But its fine, after all, it's the display and the colour reproduction that mattered the most. This monitor has a great display, the viewing angle from the side is also good... As of now, at this very moment, I'm pretty much happy with this monitor.."
1,Please do not buy this monitor as it looks amazing on website but not at all good. Its picture quality is very dull and shows fade yellowish colour instead of white colour.....Instead anyone can buy LG's Monitor. Little price variation but far better than this monitor...
5,"Ita the best WFM monitor in 2021 2nd half price.all monitor cost has gone up..i already own Dell P2419Hthis has comparable pic quality and higher refresh rate , but miss out on heigt adjustment, input options and usb uplink."
5,"I bought this monitor at a price of ₹7499 but when it was delivered to me on that day amazon reduced the price to ₹6990 thats very unfair and makes me feel cheated.Product Review:The packaging was okay. Amazon doesn’t put extra packaging on top of product. Simply put shipping label on top of the brand packaging and ship it. Product is working super good, picture quality is super good and audio output is also good. HDMI makes everything soo better."
5,"Loved the monitors, i ordered 2 of those Lenovo 21.5 inch L22e-20 Monitors and it works as expected. Can do normal office work with ease and if you're a gamer or watch 4k movies a lot then this product is not for you. Smooth transition b/w multiple screens/displays. Supports AMD-free sync if you're having an AMD chip in you laptop/pc.Overall its a good monitor."
2,"The viewing angles are not what it says in specs, the image looks distorted as even if you by 5 degrees from center of screen. There is something wrong with the contrast the image looks too white. Even after trying different settings and different machines mac/windows."
5,"I have given 5 stars because it is the best (in this range of price) Monitor for my use case. Here are my personal thoughts.Here's why you should buy it:- You are planning to use it for Gaming- You are planning to use it for watching Videos/Movies or other Multimedia- You are planning to use it for Programming/Development- You plan to do basic editing where the colour doesn't need to be too accurateHere's why you shouldn't buy it:- You already have a monitor that has higher colour accuracy than this one (which is 72% NTSC) because if you do, you're probably not going to like it- You need higher colour accuracy- You're going to be doing pretty much colour accurate work like Video (advance stuff like color grading, color correction, etc)Also, things you must make sure you know before buying it:- This is a VA Panel and not IPS. Please research on Internet the difference between the two- The blacks on this Panel are pretty dope but the viewing angles are not as good as IPS ones- HDMI Cable isn't provided in the box, you'll need to buy or have it with you before hand (unless you plan to use VGA)Final thoughts, the monitor is pretty damn good. Id definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for similar price and use case. I've always been a fan of Lenovo and honestly, I haven't been disappointed by any of the Lenovo products I've ever had. I was scared of the packaging though, it was looking like it had been opened but it wasn't, I was just too skeptic. But make sure you do check your package."
1,"After few months of use it's HDMI port stop working and then display get distorted and becomes totally un usable after few more days. the worst part is service which is just for the name sake of 3 years. actually it couldn't provide the service in very first year of purchase. they rejected the issue in very tricky way, below is lenovo service reply, afterwards they didn't clarify this mail even asking for -Dear Customer,Greetings and thank you for contacting Lenovo technical support.We understand that the system has an issue with Dead pixels issue.As per the snapshot video received, we are sorry to inform you that this system is beyond the scope of support of ‘Accidental Damage Protection’ .We could surely have assisted if the system had ‘Accidental Damage Protection’.We request you to contact the nearest Lenovo authorized service center for a chargeable repair .Regards,Lenovo Technical Support"
5,"Reviewing after 2 days of purchase:Received the monitor in good condition. Original product packaging was good enough. Amazon only provided one layer of additional package and it was enough.In the box, only VGA cable is present. If you want HDMI cable, then you should buy it separately.Build quality is good for this price. Except, that the stand is too thin for the monitor size and it leads to shaking of the monitor even on slight disturbance.Display is enough for doing office work and watching videos. I didn't test more than that.Both VGA and HDMI connections works well.Overall for this price (6999 INR when I bought) it looks totally worth it."
3,I really dont understand.. There is VGA cable with the product but not HDMI. Laptops also dont provide VGA ports nowadays. 500 rupees lesser than other brand monitors because of this. Better you buy other monitors... Dont have to go through the hassels of fetching hdmi cable.
5,"Amazing product from lenovo , edge to edge display with a beautiful and minimalist design , amazing connectivity including HDMI and audio jack ! Picture quality is amazing ! And it's crisp with good contrast . Brightness is enough for a will lit room . When run on 60hz , no tearing or lag was seen , completely seamless experience. Installation wise it was plug and play ! Overall a perfect product ! Must buy !."
4,"Product arrived in brand new condition with average packaging, within the stipulated delivery date. Monitor works perfectly for watching movies, gaming or office work. You can use it  for gaming and other purposes without using the in-built feature of AMD FreeSync. I am not using FreeSync and face no issues of lag or glitch because of it. Value for money !"
5,I'm very much impressed with the quality of the monitor outputGo for it if you are looking one within the 7-8k rangeLooks very sleek and light weight
5,"Though I haven't tried gaming on the display, it's an excellent product for 1080p video/movie so far. I have connected this display to my old laptop now I don't want to do any thing on my laptop. Build quality could be better. Easy to install. HDMI cable and power cable are long enough for proper desktop management. So far no regrets."
4,"The product is best of best, with small to no edge corner make look great as well the viewing experience.GAMING:If you're a true gamer you might not like this monitor because the refresh is visible as it moves frame which is kind of totally odd while playing.ENTERTAINMENT:Perfect without a doubt go for it. You won't feel the refresh issue here.CODING/PROFESSIONAL:I bought it for this purpose only so here's the deal if you don't care about watching frame moving to another frame that feels like as a developer so goes for it."
4,It's a good screen with vibrant colours along with a great design. Looks unique compared to other monitors.Only issue is that the stand is not height adjustable hence you need to take this into consideration.
4,"Picture quality is very good other than the annoying dead pixel (there's just one but now that I've seen it, can't un-see it).The overall build quality and image quality is very good.Haven't tried a lot of gaming on this but it should be decent, don't expect frame-perfect performance.Definitely a worthy recommendation if you can get it in some offer."
5,"this monitor can be connected to a PS4 and also to the computer , the display and the performance is very good, no lag when playing ps4 games and overall I really love the monitor. If any one are looking for multipurpose monitor then this is for you."
5,This is very good products.. and Quality is very good also... The Picture Quality is amazing.. perfect for gaming.. and movies also because brightness is good.. Price is very good..
1,"I had just received the product. It had dead pixels, dust on-screen and scratch marks on the monitor stand. I immediately called Amazon customer service. They responded positively. Excellent customer service! Promised replacement within 5 days. Hope I get the replacement soon. Will update on the replacement after I get it."
5,"Things i like- sharpness, good colours, borderless from sides. I play on ps4, its comfortable for eyes as well as you can carry long gaming sessions.Things i dont like - no hdmi cord included. I am still not able to figure out picture settings. The screen has refresh rate of 60hz so good for only consoles and low end pcs"
5,"Absolutely loved the product. It has many viewing options that inspite of the light from the front, you will still be able to read the content on the acreen clearly.Worth it. Don't think.... Just go for it in this price segment."
3,Picture Quality is average not HD. Misinformation provided by seller that it includes HDMI cable. Only VGA cable is included. Amazon Firestick is not detected so thats another misinformation.
4,"It's been 3 Days and I really liked the Picture Quality. What disappointed me was, there is no HDMI cable that came along. However, there is VGA Cable, but my office laptop doesn't have VGA port. I have to buy HDMI cable separately.I am using it with my personal laptop and I am really happy with it."
1,"Low brightness, some shade producing. Low picture quality.We can't conveniencing the customer support team to replace the monitor"
5,"Best product in the market best panel quality good keyboard mouse also good and bestest pricing in the market , happy with this"
5,Very good picture quality. Reasonably priced. Real true colors as will appear in print.
1,It's comebwith big size power plug pin So you have to purchase another power cable or extension board or another cable.Suggest to not buy go for another monitor
5,Best deal in this price.
5,I feel the speaker quality is very low and also the cable provided is VGA which doesn't work with any of my laptop as they don't have VGA port. I had to buy a connector but it doesn't support audio output. Then I bought an HDMI to HDMI cable which works pretty well for audio.
5,"This monitor is everything I need. Iam not a very heavy gamer or anything so instead of going for a 144hz TN panel I went for a 75hz IPS panel because I also want picture quality to be good and it was worth it. Watching movies is really fantastic on this monitor. Definitely go for it. Colour calibration out of the box was good but after some tweaks now it is perfect.Here you have the optimal settings if u want:Brightness: 59Contrast: 52Black boost: 5 (default)Gamma: 2.4Color: Red gain- 47, green gain- 48, blue gain-46Colour bias: Red-50, green- 50, blue-48Overdrive: NormalAll other settings: default"
1,"Purchased this one looking at numerous positive reviews. Also, checked on the technical specifications and all the features. Thought I made a good choice. The emotion stayed only untill I opened the box.What you get with this is a 16Amps power plug - which requires a special socket (and corresponding 16Amps wiring) available. These 16Amps power points one would typically use for heavy equipment like Geyser, Washing Machine, AC, etc.As these are typically found in bathrooms, kitchen or utility area, a good chance that you may not have these 16 Amps points in every room of your house. So, thats where I am. I now will have to draw a 16Amps wire all the way from my kitchen to my study room for this to work. Not only it is going to change the decor of my house but also going to cost me a good amount of money.Nowhere in the technical specification is it written that it will require a special power source; so you cannot anticipate this will happen. When you call Amazon customer care, they themselves are confused as to what can be done. To come out of confusion, they declare that 'POLICY' does not allow them for return and refund the product. So, you better be ready to get your home altered if this monitor has to work (not to forget that you do not have any flexibility to move it around in the house as you may not get a 16 Amps socket elsewhere in the house)"
3,"Ordered on 21st March 2020 with a gaming PC. Due to the covid situation, the order got delayed, understandable. PC got cancelled later but this screen was delivered on 22nd May 2020. I did not open it. Ordered PC parts and built myself a PC in a month and switched it on with this product. Found this hard to miss light bleeding issue with it. Now, return period expired way before the delivery date, but I still settled for it since it's mostly only noticeable on a completely black screen. Hardly noticeable while playing games. Other than all this, the product is good if it comes in good condition, else you need to get it replaced. Provides 75hz refresh rate and delivers quality FHD results."
4,"The monitor is pretty good-75hz display, IPS , tilt-able upto 20 degrees, has built-in speakers, dual hdmi and an audio output. They advertise it as 1ms response time, but it's not really the case. Go read up on VRB and how that works if you want. But otherwise, it's really good if you get it at sub 10k price. I got it for 9.9k but it has gone down to 9.4k at times. Usually this monitor sells at 11.5k or somewhere around that price, if that is the case then I'd suggest to just wait till it decreases or you can try AOC monitors (similar monitor , without speakers). The built-in speakers are pretty decent, much better than I expected and gets decently loud as well.The one thing I don't like is the stand. The monitor kinda wobbles when you're typing if your table isn't up against a wall. Probably because the joint where the monitor attaches to isn't strong enough, but if you do push your table up against a wall you're fine. I would have given 4.5 stars if that were an option."
5,Using this for regular office work as a second screen to my Mac book pro.So far no issues and delivers as it promises. But the picture quality is good and not excellent as some of the gamers might expect.The inbuilt speakers are as good a not there but the headphone jacks is a good addition to use an external speaker.Overall a good product for regular office work..
4,"First, I ordered  Samsung LS24R356FHWXXL (24 inch Flat) Monitor with 75Hz refresh rate, after 10 Days the monitor delivered, I seen heavy Back light bleeding issue  so I have applied for replace and replaced monitor also had small amount of back light bleed issue so I start using it. After 4 day I seen white dots in top right corner of the display☹. Immediately applied for return.After so many search and reviews, I found  Acer Nitro VG240Y bmiix (23.8 inch Display 75Hz, FHD (60cm) Monitor. I Ordered, delivery day I received a medium size box, I am just confused and I opened, its not a monitor, its plastic basket☹. I called and spoke with customer care with regarding this delivery. Then they applied for replace.Few days later I received Acer Nitro VG240Y Monitor(replaced order). There is no amazon packing but received monitor box in good condition.About Acer monitor.1. 0% Back light bleeding issue  . I am very happy because there is no back light bleeding in this monitor.2. Good quality at this price range.3. Inbuild speakers (2x2w) are added advantage. No need to turn on home theater for every time even for 1 min video. Good sound and no noise. We can watch youtube videos without turn on speakers. You can turn on home theater speakers, if you want audio with bass and loud.4. Acer providing both VGA cable and HDMI Cable. It’s actually good quality cable, it will give you good picture quality. (Samsung provide only HDMI and VGA need to buy. We can see the text and folder shadows if use Poor quality cables.)5. Acer have inbuild power adapter, so no need to worry about external power adapter will get damaged in future.6. Its giving 75Hz Refresh rate. (Samsung i seen only 60Hz not 75Hz)7. I won’t use to play any games so this part is empty.8. Bought this monitor for Rs.9,580 only.9. Every day I am checking and I am not found any issues as of now. We can see LED gaps in sky blue color while using VGA cable but it’s not a big issues or problem for me.10. 1-VGA port, 2-HDMI Ports, 1-Audio in port, 1-Audio out port. (To use monitor speakers, use aux cable from CPU to Monitor audio in)11. I am just connected with Videocon D2H set top box using HDMI cable and its works as TV very well.12. Over all is good. Budget monitor with in-build speakers, VGA & HDMI cable. Go for it."
5,I have bought two monitors for me and my friend. Looks great.Bleeding is not so heavy. (Not much visible to naked eyes even on black screens). You can see them through your phone cameras only.No dead pixel found. The picture quality is good. The colors are good.Having a built-in speaker we can use for basic notification sounds.I like the joystick menu control and also the options are on the menu are so noob-friendly.I will try to update this review after a few months of usage.
4,"Acer vg240y 24inch 75hzGot it around ₹9500Good monitor at this priceposted both 0% brightness as well as 100% brightness picturePros-good ips picture quality,great design etc etcCons-1.litte bit backlight bleeding issue(which is common in a ips panel) but not that much noticeable to normal eye2.screen flickering with VRB on(unnoticeable to normal eye)3.pixels are little bit visible to eye while watching a solid color(but it's ok for me)4.with VRB set to extreme the respond time is aroud 5-10(not 1) false marketing5.freesync and VRB are not working at the same timeSuggestions-Turn off the VRB while you are not gamingUse low brightness as possible to avoid little bit bleeding issueThanks"
5,This is a very quality product. This IPS panel really stood up to my expectations.I was looking for a good IPS panel (not gaming specific though). I use Lenovo Legion 5i with Nvidia GTX 1650 which definitely is not powerful enough to push gaming FPS upto even 120 for most of the games. So I thought of sticking with a 75hz panel. I swear this screen is a delight to watch. The colours out of the box were amazing and I didn't have to do any additional settings apart from brightness which is set to 70%. Overall brightness is good. Not less by any means.My main purpose was to use it using HDMI cable. It has 2 HDMI ports and I love it. Ports are well placed facing downward. Stands gives it a pure gaming monitor look.Overall I am satisfied as my requirements are fulfilled.
5,"After sometime of research, looks like I have made a right choice, probably it’s because I had required specs in mind properly. Acer VG240YB is just amazing, 2 HDMI, 1 mic and speaker port and inbuilt speakers too(little less sound though for movies). I have connected Firestick with this monitor and sound bar too. I use this as desktop computer and I use prime video, Netflix too. Quite comfortable and happy. You can’t control monitor’s volume using the fire stick remote. Sound bar with remote will give that convenience - 2 remotes 😟 But, Overall this is highly recommended at this price if you want to use this monitor with fire stick too."
2,"I wonder how online shopping brings so much of damaged products to us!The monitor as such is good, however, the clip which holds the panel and screen in place is out of place on a couple of spots on the top.. the package seemed to have a dent, maybe had a fall? I’m not sure.Since I just don’t want to go through the hassle of repacking this and sending it back and waiting for a new monitor, I think I’ll just continue using this.Like the other budget monitors, or as I have heard about them, there is no major backlight bleeding in this one. So that’s a relief.Anyone looking to mount this product, I’d recommend this. The stands are easily removable and also has vesa mounts placed at the right position.The overall build quality of the monitor seems to be a mix of cheap plastic and fibre with metal under-frames.The picture quality seems to be goodSince the clip is out of place (but is fixable if) I’m giving this a 2, else would have had given this product a 4  or 5 rating"
5,"Its not woaahhh high hertz. But anything above 60 is well appreciated. I mean if you can maintain that FPS in modern games (cyberpunk, i am looking at you).I use it for -> gaming (casual and competitive), digital drawing, video editingFor all 3 I have no complaints(Added bonus of speaker)For gaming you cant overclock it, but for my case (gold in valorant, silver elite in csgo and Plat in Apex) it is more then enoughUsing it for work too, theres little to no text smearing (only visible if you shove your face in screen)Bang for buck"
5,*24 inch size is quite enough for work and gaming*it looks awesome with that v shaped stand* brightness levels are good*in built speakers are also decent* most importantly its working flawlessly
4,"Great picture quality, did not see any backlight bleed, but can see IPS glow.Got ripped off on price though, got it for Rs. 12,227 during prime sale, and its now listed for Rs. 9,400!Last time I buy anything during the Prime ""Sale"". What a ripoff."
5,"The picture quality is amazing. I don't use it for video editing so screen bleeding didn't bother. But, yes there is. Not for gaming either so cannot review on the refresh rate. There is no glare that hurts your eyes, I work on this for long hours and it never hurt my eyes. If you're confused wether 23.8 is big enough? Yes it is. Overall satisfied with this screen after using for a month. Nothing that I can point out."
1,I had tried to claim my warranty to get my display repaired as It was not working.The service company straight up denied to repair the machine even if I was willing to pay for it.I feel scammed at this point
5,"Best IPS monitor under 11,000Rs.Has good picture quality, 75Hz feels smooth (If you haven't ever experienced 144Hz).Looks sexy AF, Stands are made of metal and sturdy...If you are looking for a monitor for 1080p gaming. I would recommend you to go for the 24Inch edition. 27inch will be too big.24inch is too much for a monitor (even if the images I've attached looks small, IT IS HUGE).Go for it."
5,"Best gaming monitor under budgetGood screen qualityDynamic cloursDecent speakersbuilt quality is too goodOver the design is super cool under this budget.72Hz refresh rate is not much  as compared to 60Hz but it is quite good as compared to 60hz monitersfor video editors, graphics designers this perfect moniter"
4,Amazing picture quality and good for entry level gaming. The build quality is good but would like if the body was a bit strong. You can bend this thing slightly if you put pressure. All-over I would suggest this to anyone who is low on budget but looking for 24in IPS panel.
4,"There is, unfortunately, a defect! The first slot of HDMI(there are two) is misaligned but since It was not a big deal for me other than that I would say this is the best deal at 10k(for 24 inch) if you are inserting the word ""Gaming"". Since its a 10k gaming monitor all the aspects like picture quality is average don't expect much"
4,"Very good picture quality and colour reproduction. Screen brightness is also very good. 75hz smoothness is also great for gaming.But deducting 1 star for 2 issues(1) build quality is not very good, the screen wobbles a bit on the stand and the edges of the display have slight gaps between the actual panel and the monitor body.(2) Freesync didn't really work very well as most of the time enabling Freesync caused display to blackout."
2,The Model received is VG240Y a different model from the VG240YB. A simple google check will say these models are different. The customer care expects to be convinced saying 'both are same model'. Its like convincing the buyer Iphone 6s and 6s+ are same model. Totally Disappointed.
4,acer nitro vg 240y.. good experience on gaming and movies..much clearer than my previous 900p monitori like this monitor as part of my setup!!💖looks modern and stylish to me..perhaps because i was using 9 yrs old monitor.there are many monitors better than this in market offering better clarity and immersion..but i don wanna compare or judge ..as i respect anything that i own!!
3,"Pictures are not Sharp when you sit close pixels are visible , slight input lag, flickering at high bitrate video, this monitor is more like a TV than a pc Monitor."
4,Not bright enoughPicture quality and text okFreesync and 3.5mm input not working on my unitSpeakers are worthlessPrice wise u can get better 24inchers for about 10k
5,Best in its price range.The monitor delivers great performance. Simple installation.Built in speakers are good enough. Full HD resolution and 75hz IPS display does good job for picture quality.(Playing Horiozn Zero Dawn PS4: Pictured)
1,I m not playing still games So i gave 1 star only. Monitor refresh rate automatically showing right up corner. How to off this. If shutdown and star again refresh rate showing.. This is major problem.
1,Lost and lots of flickering when VRB mode is on. No need to buy this. Buy a simple monitor with a 5ms refresh rate. I can't turn on Free sync and VRB at the same time. Bad for gaming. OKay for work. Returning it.
2,i have a bad habit of watching movies and very bad habit of measuring frame drops or quality drop now when i installed this monitor neflix HD had vidible stuttering and lag though it is 144hz dont know why but it has this problem and also movies in vlc player there was much more lag and stutter in movies but for games it worked butter smooth no problem at all on my old samsung 22 inch monitor no movie has lag it is butter smooth maybe 1080p is not enough for 27inch and text icons also on windows 10 looked bad fuzzy grainy unclear returned it i guess for 1080p we should stick till 24 inches only
5,"Day 1 review:Great Monitor, worked perfectly out of the box.No faults in LCD, perfect delivery by Amazon.On MSI website you can get 36 months warranty by registering.Performance is up to the mark, exactly as advertised.Curved display is truly special.Great for my personal use, gaming, movies and work.Will update the review if anything falls short, but so far 5/5!"
4,This review for Msi ...!best monitor in this range...Best color production & brightness....Go with this...!
2,"This is a misleading product.First, its LCD VA technology. Not LED.Second, backlight bleeding issue. Its almost impossible to see dark scenes.Third No Audio through HDMI cable.Amazon should have the decency to refund me for this garbage."
5,"I purchased this almost 3 weeks ago. I have been using it daily for browsing, video editing and gaming. I game almost 2-3 hours daily and I did a lot of research in finding the best monitor under 18k which fits my requirement of FULL HD, 165hz and 27 inch screen. This one hit the bulls eye. All the reviews of this monitor online are positive. I would strongly recommend this to all those who love gaming and video editing."
4,"Here's my experienceThe monitor is really good for gaming and all other media stuff. However, my only problem is that when watching movies or looking at pictures the color pink is very bright..or over saturated idk how to say it... it's so bright that sometimes when there are tiny pattern on things, the over saturation of the color sometimes hides the pattern.Regarding backlight bleeding there are some, but not to the point where they obstruct the color of what you r looking at, meaning they do not bleed through movies and games so no worries there."
5,"i got it for 25900 during sale, colour, contrast are good not like ips,viewing angle is ok, once you play at 2k never goes back to fhd, graphics are vry good at 2k, m very happy 😊"
4,Good 27inch Va panel with 1440 p res. ( 2k ) .. Curved with good viewing angles .. not so vivid.. Overall looks great with superb build quality. value for money....  !!
4,The the performance is amazing and the overall pc is good but it isn't 165hz when you open the settings for increasing Hz the maximum available option is 144hz
5,"Bought for my son... Curve screen is best for gaming, coding, online classes, coaching etc... Best fit with- MOTHERBOARD MSI B450 Gaming Plus- RYZEN 5 3600- GRAPHICS GTX 1650- Cabinet Zeb Cronus from Zebtronics- RAM 8 GB- 250GB SSD and 2 TB HDD(its optional)"
5,This is so nice monitor (in VA panneIs). I was looking for high refresh rate monitor with good pannel but price and choice of products were mot matching then I got this monitor in 14.5k. In such a price range I was only getting TN pannels. I've played games with higb refresh rate its a very good monitor for gamer who does not play e sports. Talking about video quality color reproduction is good. I think if u get this monitor for 14.5 -15.5 k then it is good to go Monitor.Pro -1. Built quality2. 144hz refresh rate3. Good color reproduction than TN4. Better viewing angles than TN5. Good VA pannelCons-1. Might get input lag if u are an Esport player. (Casual gamer STFU and buy)2. Color reproduction is not at par with IPS pannel3. It's hight is not adjustable.
5,"I was little hesitant to place my order after reading some reviews on this item but, as soon as the prime day went on, I placed the order and saved almost 4k.The product come in one piece..no fault or anything. Product is gorgeous... display brightness is enough for me.. enjoyed playing game so far I'm really satisfied and happy with my purchase.Just one con- Go for QHD in 27inch. I only bought the 1080p 27inch version because of my budget and as per my requirement.We can see every pixel in 1080 27inch variant which can cause a pain in our eyes just an advice.Overall a good panel and brand quality"
3,"Actually very good for gaming and for people who do not care about their game looking like Minecraft.Video playback or viewing photos makes this problem much clear. There is just not enough bit depth in this monitor (or at least in the one I received) to show even slightly dark elements. Fade in, fade out transitions literally look like pixel clusters. For the money you put into this, I think there are better options. While gaming at least, it is good enough with proper refresh rates. Supports 144hz even through HDMI."
4,"This monitor does tick some of the boxes, however if you are looking for deepest blacks, great contrast, full frame to frame dispay then you might be disappointed. Overall if you get this monitor for a discount then it's vfm. However 27"" is overkill at 1080p. Go for 24"". Note that although this is almost bezelless, display has a cm border around it so it has ""internal"" bezel so to speak."
1,worst colour production and screen flickering issues very lags when playing picture quality is also very worst pls go for qhd monitor
5,"Absolute bang for buck!  You might have to tweak monitor a bit. But once done, it looks awesome.got it for 25k."
1,"Please do not buy msi monitors,it's money waste. Poor build quality. Performance is not upto the mark.Go for some standard monitor brand( Samsung,Acer,Asus).."
5,Very nice
5,"For work from home and my personal system, I have connected both to this monitor and the switch is seamless.The screen is bright and clear enough for my needs.Color calibration is not the best out of the box but is still good enough.Good and sturdy stand."
5,"I bought for my HP omen 15 laptop even though I using hdmi cable I can see the smoothness  full on 120HZ refresh rate I'm not sure until I got the package now I'm satisfied go for the 24"" 144hz varient everything works fine as they mentioned.awsome build quality and panel as well."
1,There is no GST invoice for this high value product. ???
5,I was doubting whether it can support 144hz or not but it did ! . I have connect my legion y740 with rtx 2060 . It's working flawless .
5,Video Player is loading.
2,Video Player is loading.
5,First time using a curved gaming monitor.Looks & feels great.Awesome experience.
5,"If you want a curved monitor with high refresh rate for gaming and design, just buy this one. It is just so good I am loving the experience with it."
5,Good Monitor. I got this during sale at 25300. It is the best option at this price
5,"i have been using for past 15 days now.Best investment i have ever made.Using for excel,emails and web (youtube incl) the experience is best."
1,Dont buy this......this series have light bleeding issue.....light is leaking from every where
4,First time using a curved gaming monitor.Looks great. The colors are bright and I can easily get constant 120Hz refresh rate out of the HDMI cable. Awesome experience.
5,The screen is peeling out
5,"Picture quality is fine , good gaming experienceAnd overall monitor is good"
5,nice
1,"I'm the first buyer of this product.The one that I received was defective. It had a pale red patch in the top center of the screen. Image attached. Currently returning this one for a replacement. Will update as the replacement arrives.Things you should know before buying this product:1. It is a Gsync compatible only monitor, not a Gsync ultimate one. This means there is no Gsync module inside. It is just an Nvidia version of Freesync.2. The one I received had little to no backlight bleeding, but there was huge amount of IPS glow and it was awful. Rtings.com also says that this monitor has such high amounts of IPS glow. The backlight bleeding varies from unit to unit.3. Poor viewing angles - The viewing angles on this monitor is like that of a TN panel. This is because of the strong IPS glow. Rtings.com also found the same.4. Vignetting effect - The horrendous amount of IPS glow creates a vignetting effect. Pixels farther away from the screen appears dim.5. Non-uniform brightness - The brightness is not uniform everywhere on the screen. This is also related to the vignetting effect.6. There were two dead pixels that I could find. Being a 4k display, they were far too small to cause any nuisance.There were no issues of flickering, or vertical banding or sleep-to-wake problem, or dust particles being stuck beneath the screen.Some good things about the monitor:1. The colors are terrific. I haven't seen such beautiful reds. They are like blood.2. If you are a programmer, then dark modes look beautiful on this one (and in general on all IPS monitors). Dark mode is typically bad on VA monitors because of the high contrast ratio of VA panels that makes the text look like floating on ink. On IPS panels, dark backgrounds look like they are moonlight, if you understand what I mean. On VA panels, the background is like deep ink. IMO, the moonlight is more easy on the eyes.Overall this is the cheapest 4k144Hz monitor. I don't think you will find anything better than this up until the X27. If it were not for the red patch in the center of the screen, I would have kept it.Also, I couldn't comment on the fluidity of the panel, since my GPU does not support 144Hz output. I have purchased a new GPU which will take a few days to arrive. I'll update this review after that. Also, I'll update on my findings with the replacement unit.Update:--~~~~~~~~This is incredibly shameful. I wrote 10+ emails, called Amazon customer care 10+ times, and even today I spoke with a senior customer care executive who escalated the matter. But still the return pickup guy did not come to pick up the aforementioned items.Currently, I am waiting on my 11th day since I started the return process."
5,"Based on an IPS panel by Innolux, which is also used in the Gigabyte Aorus AD27QD , the Acer XV272U monitor supports 10-bit color via dithering (8-bit + 2-bit FRC) and covers 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut (~130% sRGB). For 10-bit color, you will have to limit the refresh rate to 120Hz. Gsync working without any issues with RTX 2070 over a DP cable even though this is not certified compatible. HDR is a gimmick but nice to have. You cannot use both FreeSync and HDR at the same time.There are three response time overdrive presets (Off, Normal, and Extreme). You cannot use ‘Extreme’ and VRR (FreeSync) simultaneously.At 144Hz, the Acer XV272U input lag amounts to only ~4ms when you enable the Ultra-Low Latency option in the OSD. There are no issues when it comes to the performance; no excessive IPS glow, backlight bleeding, or dead/stuck pixels.If you don’t need HDR nor DCI-P3 color gamut, there is more affordable 27″ 1440p 144Hz IPS models such as the Acer Nitro VG271UP without the stand adjustment.  HDMI cable is included in the box. DP cable needs to be purchased separately."
3,"Hello friends,  there is no much reviews available for acer xv270p , so i wud like share experience.If you are a person looking for high quality display for colors like professional and evrything then this monitor is not for you.If u are a person looking for budget monitor with decent specs-  then Yes. ButBudget IPS panels have weird issues.I got the first monitor,  which had dead subpixels. Rest all was good no back light bleed or anything.The seller was kind to replace and amazon for  helping. It was a good experience to shop from seller and amazon as they acknowledged the issue and helped meSo i got the replacementBut the replacement product had back light bleeding and it had a power cord thats not suitable for the room sockets, you cannot plug in, u need a socket ment for heavy appliances like AC ,Oven and all.So i was surprised,  the previous one had dead pixel and very raerly a discolouration vertical line, rest everything was perfect, the cord size and all.Second one had black light bleed and incompatible power cord socket which make it unusable,  using that cord nd shoving it into ur monitor with higher input volt , specially in india where voltage fluctuate. Also u can't put into UPS sockets.I did not understand  Why ! , same product and so much different with accessories. i couldn't unnotice the huge manufacturing differences and came to conclusion that the replacement is a defective product and the first one too.I still wanted the same model as its good monitor if u get everything right, but i couldn't get replacement again, so ended up returning.Huge thanks to amazon and support. Because seeing the other reviews i thought i  wud lose money , i was fortunate to get things done.I also had video backup of unboxing process so no one points in later stage.Conclusion: all the monitors in this price range have one or the other issue,  some face it soon, some later. And also u can b lucky to not face any issues at all.So because amazon service is good, i wud definitely say, u can buy the monitor chances of getting good one is more. Dont get confused with reviews.If u feel u wont get replacement or return then dont buy.Welcome to the world of cheap IPS panels, where i feel manufacturers are just pushing new models as competition rather than making sure about quality and reliability.  what i feel abt manufacturers in 2020.Usability : if u are not going to keep like minimum 1feet distance from monitor then u wud propably notice the pixels clearly in Full HD 27inch monitors. Some of u may not like this. They can opt for 24inch as it has higher DPI.Also the MRP price was less than what its shown and make u feel getting huge discounts.Feedback to manufacturer: i would like to say, this monitor has potential to grow in market,  the quality needs to be improved and make the screen reliable for heavy use in long run.  This could be the only reason if this model fails in long run.Also please update the accurate product description in acer india website , i did not find the model itself. Which was stressful as cannot depend on just amazon description which is not complete.I tried reaching to Acer customer support,  trust me , i couldn't go further from IVR response . Difficult to reach for any enquiry and service. Please resolve the issue.Feedback to amazon: i returned the product with top notch conditions,  but the pick up person to verify the product, handles badly due to hurrying up the process, i was like doing that way will definitely screw up product in process.Products like this that has display and these days bezel less,  needs more care during handling."
1,"Ordered 2 gaming monitors from Amazon. One was delivered on 28th April and another on 30th April. When i tried to set up the monitors, realized that one of the monitors was shipped with a 16A power plug which doesn't fit into any of my sockets. Immediately i ordered new cables from Amazon which were delivered the next day.Once the monitors were set up, I immediately realized one of the monitor's brightness was completely different. It was like the blue light filter was by default ON. Upon checking all settings were exactly the same. Swapping, different HDMI cables nothing worked.  I reached out to Acer support in this regard on 2nd May. After some basic troubleshooting, they determined that a service engineer would visit for further troubleshooting. However, no one came nor called to date.Later I called Amazon customer service and a hand-to-hand replacement was arranged.The replacement product was received on 8th May'21. Bummer this one has the same exact issue. Upon investigating both monitor packages. I realized that the good monitor was manufactured in Jul'20. The other 2 (Replaced & Replacement) monitors were manufactured in Nov'20.Again called Amazon customer service, spoke to multiple people. Everyone seems to echo the same scripted resolution. They can only issue a refund for the replacement monitor and not the entire order. I need a Dual monitor for my work. How can I use 2 monitors with different color and brightness levels? Can't Amazon support NOT understand such a simple thing. Also was I repeatedly being advised to place a new order with no guarantees from Amazon customer service that I wouldn't Nov'20 batch monitor. After much argument, a Manager call has been arranged in 48 hrs. Let's see what that person has to say.@AMAZON Support:I DON'T NEED A REFUND. Just REPLACE it with a Ju1'20 manufactured product or REPLACE the Jul'20 product with NOV'20 manufactured product. I am ok with either one of the resolutions.@ACER:What kind of quality control do you have? Also, your support is equally PATHETIC."
5,"Bought this monitor after searching long and hard for a proper upgrade to my aging 1080p 23inch AOC monitor. Needed something for gaming, consuming content with vivid and accurate colours and big enough to immerse me in it completely. Found this to be the perfect fit, albeit in the pricier range, and with 144hz feature that isn't of much use for me in the immediate future, but worth it in the long run.The colours on this monitor is absolutely gorgeous. It comes colour calibrated, along with a document showing the details of the calibration. The brightness is more than enough to force me to turn it down to 20-30% for normal web use. The I/O is great, with support for DP 1.4. The HDR is decent, as one would expect for HDR 400 certified monitor.  As for the backlight bleeding mentioned in other reviews, I haven't really found it to be that distracting or overpowering.  The bezels are small on 3 sides, allows for the 27inch screen to stand out. Something that isn't clear in the pictures given on the site is the amazing stand it comes with that allows for 90 degrees rotation (maybe 360 degrees too, haven't tried) of the monitor, a decent amount of height adjustment, as well as a solid base that allows for easy swiveling of the monitor, all welcome additions.However, do note that the packaging it came in was damaged for me. Seems like an amazon issue rather than the seller as others have had a much better experience. The box had multiple cuts, deep ones, but thankfully, the monitor inside seems undamaged.There was an issue with the transaction in my case, but the seller xtronicsapp was very helpful in communicating with me and promptly solving that issue with no hassle at all. Something I didn't expect from any seller on this site, so 5 stars to xtronicsapp. Go for this monitor if you have the money, and go for the seller for a great customer service given in case any issue should arise."
1,"Seeing the positive reviews i bought one recently and the monitor had a color temperature issue, the top half of the monitor is cooler and bottom half is warmer, no amount of tinkering with the color temperature settings can solve this issue but had no backlight bleeding. I decided to get a replacement because its very noticeable on a white background or light color background. The second monitor has huge backlight bleeding on the right side and the same color temperature issue. I am done with Acer monitors, last year i tried VG271UP which had bleeding from everywhere but no temperature issue. At this point i have returned 3 monitors in a span of 4 months. The quality control for these IPS displays are horrible. I cant spend 25k+ and live with a defective monitor. Time to move on to a different company and pray that i receive a good monitor. Thanks to amazon's quick refund/replacement policy during situations like these."
5,This monitor is way better choose then Acer Nitro VG271U . It has a great brightness and supports HDR. It's height adjustable. The quality is perfect with even support for 1 MS delay . If you are gamer but also enjoy multimedia better go for this then the TN pannel. You will enjoy it better.
3,The monitor is bright and colourful besides the edge glow and too much backlight bleeding which is common among most acer monitors. It’s actually on luck and there are possibilities that your display has less bleeding while I was very unlucky that my monitor had excessive bleeding so I returned it back. Seller quickly accepted the returned and my money was refunded in 4 working days. Now I have order a BenQ monitor ex2780q which had better review than this monitor. Choosing a monitor for gaming is tough decision so I would suggest you to do R&D On display types on YouTube. I spent 4 days to finally go for BenQ. Wish me luck on its arrival. Hoping for good results
5,"After completing close to one month research for a dual-purpose Monitor, I choose this Acer product, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. Price, features and Technology are in perfect balance. Important information regarding USB usage, there is one cable provided by Acer with this product which needs to be connected to the computer, to enable USB on the monitor. Without this cable, only charging will happen and no other device will work. G-Sync works very well on this monitor( I am using GTX 1660 ti ).Highly impressed with 2K resolution, HDR and 144hz refresh features. With 30k budget, I couldn't find a better product than this comparing with LG, BenQ which are charging 5k extra for similar functions."
5,"FYI for Indian buyers: This monitor comes with a 15A cable instead of a regular 5A one. You may not have 15A outlets in your room, so if you're getting this monitor, make sure you have an extra 3-PIN POWER CABLE (for desktops and monitors, NOT laptop 3-pin power cable) that's rated for 5A. Acer has approved 5A cables to be used with this, and I'm using one with no issues.Now, for the actual review. This monitor is excellent. It has deep black levels, and the colour contrast is fantastic. However, brightness settings are weird because the lowest setting is way too high.I'll admit, 144Hz is not the kind of revolutionary upgrade I'd expected it to be, but it definitely makes first-person games look and feel much better to play.Speakers kinda suck, so definitely use headphones or get external speakers. Height adjustment is definitely a plus, and the monitor and stand both feel quite sturdy.Granted, I've only had it for a short while now, but I'm really liking it so far."
3,"Cons1) my eyes hurt like crazy after using it for like 30 minutes maximum brightness is all good but the minimum brightness of this monitor is similar to about 80% brightness of my macbook (2017 13 inch). Unfortunately I'll have yo return this for this single reason.2) other reviews said that there was very less issue of backlight bleeding but you can see the pictures for yourself3) if you're coming from something like a macbook you'll immediately notice that the texts are not as sharp this is because of less ppi. If you're not a gamer I'd suggest you to go for a 4k monitor with less refresh rate.4) it says on details and features section that you can rotate 90 you can but the stand it comes with will get in your wayPros1) as far as i can tell colors are better on this monitor compared to my macbook (note: just my personal experience not an expert)2) it's one thing to imagine how big it'll be but mannn this this is huge.3) 144hz: i plugged my mac and started using it didn't notice anything, but as soon as i went back on my mac screen bro i was like where's the smoothness did my mac break so something is it lagging? You can feel while scrolling4) brightness if you like it it gets crazy bright5) good stand other from not rotating 90 degree"
3,I have used two high performance 2k monitors in past acer xb271hu and benq ex2780q.This is the xb273k gp version and doesnt match to all the xb273k reviews you’d find.This monitor has great response times cant measure but feels way better than the above two mentioned great colors and no issues with gsync.Perfect for gaming.But this has a pretty weird issue in light backgrounds everything’s good but in dark (games like metro exodus) you’ll have to move your head around becomes pretty annoying at first I thought it to be bad ips glow but comparing to benq seems like it has on par or less glow(with blue led is this one) but I don’t understand whats the issue is either its the coating applied or something else but  I am going to keep this as this is otherwise a great 4k gaming monitor.But there’s this weird greyish hue on the bottom two corners and its pretty evident.
5,The box looked a little worn. but when opened and installed i got a pretty good panel little to no backlight bleed and the IPS glow is also pretty less HDR 400 is very less but i use my pc in a dim lighted room so 400nits is enough so far. Amazing for gaming. would not recommend overclocking to 144hz on 4k as there is not much difference from 120Hz to 144Hz. but you will have to use 2 display ports to achieve that at the cost for color accuracy.. Will update in a few weeks are testing it on RTX 3080
5,"Update after 1 Year.This is a great monitor, I dont even see the backlight bleed anymore in the replaced unit. I've been using it each day for 8-10 hours without any issues.The stand is a little wobbly, but no major issues.Will buy another one to complement it and build my multi monitor system further.----------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE after 20 days - Backlight bleed is visible in dark backgrounds, attaching for reference, will be replacing this from the brand and will update here after that. Apart from the the monitor is great.----------------------------------------------------------------------Fantastic value for money monitor.This high quality 2k 144hz ips panel  with superb calibration is unparalled in IndiaThe stand is great too. But if you are planning to get a vesa mount , then the vg271u would be cheaper option with same panel.Negligible blb, ips glow isn't visible to naked eye and no dead/stuck pixels.------------------------------------------------"
5,"Summary/TL;DR: Buy if you care about high refresh rate, adequate resolution, and color accuracy.  If you only care about two out of these 3, there are other better monitors for your use cases.Pros:1. Fantastic color accuracy. I am an amateur photographer and work extensively on a macbook pro 15. That screen sets the reference for me. The had a Dell 24 inch monitor earlier (which was no match to the macbook). The acer is indistinguishable to my eyes from the macbook in terms of color unless you look very deeply2. Resolution: There are a ton of 4K monitors for the price with similar color accuracy. There are also a ton of 1080p 240hz monitors for the price. Depending on your specific use cases those might be better. But I find 1440p perfect for me as most upper mid-range GPUs (<Rs. 20K) are perfectly capable of using the resolution and the 144hz refresh rate too.3. Refresh rate: Just like resolution, I think 144hz is the sweet spot for refresh rate. Everything from just browsing to gaming feels great. Anything higher is difficult to practically achieve with affordable graphics cards and IMO harder to distinguish too (I honestly can't make out 240Hz from 144Hz unless looking for it). The response times could be better but not bad by any meansCons:1. Uneven brightness: On a pure black screen with the monitor on, in a dark room, you can see the backlight is quite uneven. This does not happen on my macbook. But upon digging through Reddit and other forums, I gathered that this is common with budget monitors. And it is not noticable in general use cases. But it's definitely average in this regard.2. HDR: This is just a feature thrown in for marketing. There is no advantage to having HDR on or off and in a lot of cases, it's probably better off. HDR 400 ~= no HDR. If you need great HDR, HDR 600 is where you start seeing a little difference and HDR 1000 is where it's obvious. Don't buy monitors for HDR when they say it's HDR 400."
5,"Before this I have used two LG monitors - 27GL650F and 27UK650.Problem with full HD 27GL650F was up close the text and image look pixelated and because of it display didn't look smooth. Made me realize full HD may not look the best on a 27"" display. The 4k 27UK650 was sharp, clear and so smooth even at half a feet. Couldn't make out even a single pixel but practically didn't find it worth it. Good for Videos, but not appropriate for development work since most normal people don't consume content in 4k and my GC (3060ti) was struggling to get over 60 fps at high settings.Anyway, I read all the reviews and did my own research. Not pros and cons but rather few facts I observed about this monitor  -- QHD seem perfect resolution for 27"". Can't make out the pixels in text and display is so smooth. Sits just below 4k display clarity- Colors are vibrant, seem accurate and pop out. Much better than display of 27GL650F and very close to 27UK650- Menu navigation is simple and easy- 4 USB ports helps a lot. Didn't notice any delays when connecting keyboard and mouse to it.- Speaker is decent and better than having none like on 27GL650F and 27UK650- SDR Brightness is less, even at peak brightness it is no where near the level of both LG's. HDR brightness is just average. But this was fine for me. People who like or need too bright display may have to reconsider. If at night time I had to reduce brightness of LG's to 25-30% then for this monitor its 60% so you can get an Idea. Still looks fine under outside light in daytime, matte screen helps too.- HDR seems useless at least in gaming. Colors were washed out and dull in far cry 5 so had to turn it off. Consider HDR 400 as a specification on paper.- Better ergonomics. The way stand is designed and works makes it so easy to handle (definitely better than LG's)- bezels are so slim that display sometime feel like small for a 27"". Not so flat from back side.- Played few games, response time seem good- The first and biggest inconvenience you will notice will be the power cable, Not sure why they included a bigger 16amp plug. Have to buy a 16 amp to 6 amp converter or a new power cable. So that maybe extra INR 300 investment to make it work.- The original power cable is 1.8 meter and power adapter is inbuilt, so that's quite good and less clutter.- Didn't find any dead pixel and it had usual IPS glow, nothing out of the ordinary. If I don't feel the light bleed under normal usage I don't go crazy over the bright corners under black display and taking snap from phone make it look much worse then it actually is.- Import month was Jul 2021.- Ports are a bit underneath so takes some effort. But looks clean from back side. Two usb port on sides are very convenient. Got only HDMI cable in box.- Build quality is good, specially the stand. Very easy to setup.So, Overall I would say a very good candidate for QHD 144hz display in this price range. I really liked it for its color and vibrant display, ergonomics, usb hub feature, Inbuilt adapter & speaker, slim bezels. Watch out for brightness and the power cable. Don't take it seriously for HDR usage."

5,"Edit on product review....🥸1st one was bought from ( GROW MORE DEALS) Thought, worst buy of all as packaging was tempered if i compare with my re-buy from (Appario Limited).(Grow More Deals) Acer predator xb273k box was total sealed with foam wrap on box but monitor was defective inside. There was no sealing tape on box and box had dust on it and i mean real dust as taken out after years... Took me a week to get the product and another week to send by my side, even  paying shipping fee from my side, they even took 10% out from refund for Restock.. WTFun(Appario Limited) Acer predator xb273k monitor came in 2 days time with no extra packaging but box had seal tape of acer. I was afraid of getting another something bad one... But to my surprise the monitor was bang good, everything is great working with no issue.Difference...Well 1st buy was 8k lower in price so i can say they might selling refurbished (GMD) 🤣..Then the box wasn't sealed on 1st buy... And with extra dust as bonus😅Next thing i saw was instructions manual was in open packet in 1st box whereas in re-buy it was in sealed pack even the charging cable was in seperate packs not together as was in 1st buy😒Many coverings on monitor legs were missing and face cover was torn from middle in 1st buy when compared to re-buy😞Lastly was extra protection as monitor neck foam, termacol base in box for monitor stand, and plastic covers on both side of box hand grips were all missing in 1st buy.. ConclusionNo More Grow More Deals... 😵But 5 star on buy from Appario.. Satisfied with product"
5,"This monitor maintains the perfect balance between gaming performance and content creation. With VBR enabled it provides 1ms response time. Also has 10-bit colour depth, vhich is really usefull for better video quality. Also, as it is factory calibrated the colours are straight up perfect out of the box. However the downside is the downside (only for pure gaming performance) is that, because it has IPS panel ( which is actually great for content creation) it sometimes has slow response time and also shadowing. Overall it is the perfect mid range 1440p 144hz monitor. And also one should know that HDR400 really does not make much of a difference at 250nits brightness, HDR really shines at 1000nits+. However this panel is G-SYNC compatible(not certified), which means no screen tearing.But, in the end the 1440p 144hz IPS panel gives, sharpness, speed and quality all at a justified price."
1,"At this price, it's probably only Acer who's giving these specifications (1440p, 144Hz). And I guess the way they're able to do this is thanks to abysmal quality control.I initially received the original unit, which had at least 10 dead pixels. Immediately asked for a replacement, and the Amazon tech specialist was happy to oblige after checking the pictures.Received the replacement unit after almost 5 days, and that also had the same issue. At this point, I was so furious with Acer that I just initiated a return pickup and placed the order for an LG Ultragear 27GL850.It could just be my luck, or it could be that the seller was trying to push out defective units somehow. Either way, this has wiped all trust I had in Acer products."
5,"Seller: XtronicsappPanel has 0 defects, Backlight bleed is negligible and no dead pixels on arrival. Has a height adjustable stand that is sturdy (I am not using a mount so can confirm), colors are crisp af!"
2,"I wish I had seen Polarstar's review( 9th May )  before buying this monitor because while the product reviews had it bright and vibrant, what I got was a very yellow-tinted, very low-brightness monitor.Searching around the internet, it seems to be a widespread issue for recent buyers. It's especially noticeable to people who had already bought this monitor before late 2020 and then bought one recently. Mine was manufactured in Nov. 2020.Apparently, Acer have changed the panel on this model and while the new panel looks to be better for gaming(faster pixel response times), the picture quality is very different with very low brightness and whites being yellow and blacks looking slightly greenish.I have it alongside LG's nanoIPS 27GL850 which costs substantially more than this monitor because it had the best pixel response times for an IPS monitor. The Acer monitor seems to keep up with the LG when it comes to fast-paced FPS games, but the picture quality looks absolutely dismal in comparison. Bright day on LG looks like overcast on Acer, and that's before you notice the strange colors due to the yellow-tint on it.I'd suggest to keep away from this monitor if you want the monitor that originally came out a couple of years before and was reviewed as such."
5,"Upgrading from 24inch 1080p to 27inch 1440p feels huge. Great display with good colors. A great IPS gaming display under 25k but i got it in 21k which is superb for 2k 144hz ips monitor. One thing i notice that in SDR mode the display brightness not looks that high. Its little lower then my old lg 24mp88 monitor. But in HDR mode you get good brightness  and colors feels amazing. One minor issue i notice the display gets pretty warm near the acer branding, i think their is very little gap between internal power supply and display. Manufacturer should fix this one issue. Thanks."
3,"Received the product with no USB ports!!The ports were empty i.e. the manufacturers forgot to put the usb ports.M happy as I got a replacement but it was 4 days late as per scheduled day.Product is great.ISSUES:- When in dark , LCD light bleeding occures, can't complain as LCD with thin bezels have this issue predominantly.- Brightness can't be much reduced... At night the lowest brightness feels like it's at 50% brightness... for this issue What I do is I turn on the reading mode with lowest brightness this kind of solves the issue of brightness at Night.- Made in ChinaGreat product overall for this price."
2,The product is good but I had to pay 24k and now in just 6-7 days its 19k. What's with that?
3,"I chose monitor over the Acer VG271 because of its mentioned that XV has better panel, color accuracy and ergonomic option thinking it'd worth my extra 5k but I was wrong as per the side by side comparison with my BenQ ew2775zh (FHD 60hz) which is a regular monitor I was extremely disappointed by Acer's panel and color accuracy.. its very dull in blackness, but fine in bright colors, the viewing angle mentioned are 178 degree but its almost like a TN panel. You don't even get to see anything same if you compare the colors from center to corner of the screen.This monitor is a charm solely for gamers and media consumers, 144hz makes things extremely smooth even the little things like scrolling and mouse pointer movement makes a HUGE improvement in smoothness.Compared to my 13k BenQ monitor I expected Acer to show atleast decent colors since my BenQ mon is not a designer or creative's choice its just a regular cheap monitor that gets things done so it was a shock for me to see my 13k mon outperform this 30k monitor in color accuracy, viewing angle and in light bleeding.I'd say don't choose this monitor if you are not going to use the ergonomics much you can easily find a vesa under 2.5k and attach it to Acer VG271 otherwise if you don't mind spending extra 5k and keep things simple go for this.Decent for gaming, 100% not recommend for creative work."
5,"This is great 2k monitor for less than 25k price range. Picture quality is very sharp and colors are accurate as this is pre callibrate monitor. Panel is bright, even at 50% p rightness it feel very bright in normal lighting condition. Text is very sharp even viewing from close distance doesn't feel distorted. I didn't noticed any major back light bleeding whit my unit. To get 144hzd you must connect it to display port with display port 1.4 cable (which you need to buy separately and), also for better experience good to have HDMI 2.2 cable. Monitor is heavy and stand is firm but wobbles when you try to adjust monitor tilt, so make sure you have sturdy table. Overall this is best monitor for gaming, office work, programming, photo n video editing. Go for it."
5,"I'm not a gamer but I'm sure my son will use it for that soon. As a developer and Linux admin and user I think i'll keep it in a consistent vertical position because being able to see the entirety of a website or full length of the code i'm working on or even the full length of a linux update or script run. Scrolling has been minimized to almost nothing. - Such a beautiful thing. And the 4 port usb 3 hub was a big plus.Tip - when you go to turn the monitor vertical, you'll need to tilt it back a bit because it's too tall for the base."
5,Very nice product. Best value-for-money gaming monitor. Gives a tough fight to 40-50k monitors as well. Colour reproduction is fantastic. Sadly my laptop outputs quad hd @ 60hz :( But still sharpness is mindblowing. Every bit worth the price. Pics attached.Only con is that the speakers are really bad. The thinness of monitors nowadays means manufacturers can't attach proper speakers to them. Acer should have included at least a decent one with such a beautiful panel.😍😍🥰👍🏻 Overall highly recommended. Pls hit helpful button if you found it helpful.Edit: Scaling output gives 120 Hz via HDMI. Images much smoother as well as crisp now.
1,"I bought this monitor in april.and i have 6800 for GPU.from the day one once i plugged it in,I have been seeing flickering lines if i choose referesh rate 122/144hz.1st i thought okay may be i need 16A power cord so i got that still the same issue'sthen i though okay may be i need a better DP so i got gold plated 8k monitor 120Hz supporting DP,Still the same issue.so at this point i searched on reddit for it and sure enough ppl have reported pannel issues with this model and advised not to buy it.SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 120HZ OR 144HZ 2K IPS DISPLAY,THIS IS NOT THE ONE."
4,"Its says what it is nothing more. 144@IPS 8Bit+FCR=10Bit Monitor with HDR 400 . However to use it properly calibration of Gamma is required. Because default gamma makes is stupidly dark.This could be the reason many says it has terrible black light uniformity. Because by default Gamma is set to 2.4. If you set it to 2.0 from settings and you are golden. 2.4 gamma is for Apple retina displays, why acer chose to put 2.4 as default for this monitor is either naïve or a firmware bug. Secondly If you want to enjoy HDR go buy an HDR TV not this.Brightness is less adjustable so mind that.Buy if its specs suits ur needs. Otherwise Asus or LG if you have enough cash to burn.$$"
4,"On my first order, I got a monitor with a defective speaker but the panel was good with no backlight bleed and minimal IPS glow. I then sent it for replacement and ordered a new one but this one has minimal backlight bleed but speakers are working fine. Going to keep this one since the seller has now increased the price also and I can live with the minimal BLB."
4,"I give 4 out of 5 stars to this product (Acer Nitro XV 27U). But why?? first of all the colour accuracy of this monitor is beyond my expectations... The colours look on this monitor is just perfect. A 27 inch huge display with 2k resolution (support upto 4k, not recommended) and HDR400 support makes it a true pleasure to use. But  it has a major issue...its about it brightness. When I use this monitor any mode (I.e. SDR, ECO,GAMING or else) other than Hdr400 or auto mode, the screen brightness is down to very low even when brightness is set at 100.It is really very disappointing. But when you set the screen setting at auto with windows hdr mode on then all the problems are solved.I donot know whether it is a technical faulte or company makes it as it is?? The gaming experience on this monitor is very enjoyable (no issue with that). It supports 120 Hz with hdmi cable at 1080 p and 60 Hz at 2k resolution (this may be for my graphics card which is gtx 750 Ti). Overall it is a very recommendable product(price to performance ratio).Go for it as all I can say."
4,"Best monitor with this price point besides looking modern and attractive, frameless designs enable seamless multi-monitor setups. . with support of VGA/HDMI .HDMI 1.3-1.4b versions support up to 144 Hz refresh rate@1080p and 75 Hz@1440p, while HDMI 2.0-2.0b versions support 240Hz@1080p, 144Hz@1440p and 60 Hz@2160p (4K). & also....AOC Lowblue Light protects you from harmful blue light which, during long sessions, has been shown to cause eye strain, headaches, and sleeping disorders. ....And also comes withWide Viewing Angle features display color accurately at viewing angles of up to 178°. This way, it does not matter where you choose to view it from, colors will be displayed perfectly."
4,"The AOC 22B2H 21.5"" is a good monitor for the price, I bought it for around 6000 Rs. note it's a VA panel don't expect amazing colours or brightness. coming to brightness it's typically around 200 to 150 nits which is very low so that's one downside of this monitor and but if somebody wants a monitor just for 22"" size and looks kind of good as it has 3 sides Bazel less it's a very good buy but don't expect anything more than that  for the price I think its a good monitors"
4,"Initial 10 days, it worked flawless. Then suddenly it automatically goes into low power standby mode while watching videos. After a week, it is again working without issues. PC running with power saving settings off. Weird self rectified issue. Still worth buying for the price.Not for professional video or photo editing work. Decent for E sport games."
4,Worth the money. Could be better tho
4,Nice
5,great monitor at this price
5,Op
2,"Only For those who care about quality otherwise good product:Build quality of the product is not good. It feels cheap. Metal parts are left unpoliished(Made in china). Buttons make loud tuk-tuk sound when pressed. Panel looks purplish instead of black because low quality LED's are use used to make the panel. Brightness is good but that does not matter, because what is the point of it. This is the reason why it is not good for watching movies in night.For gamers its is good. Take Care."
4,"This is a nice economical entry level full HD LCD Monitor with backlit LED. It has a wide range Of input ports (no USB port though). I am using it with my Amazon FireTV stick and streaming Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney + Hotstar, etc. as well as my old Lenovo laptop. Connected my old Altec Lansing 2.1 speakers for a much better sound output quality and volume than the 2 built in speakers. Only item that would have been very useful is a remote control for adjusting volume, picture quality etc. And a little more gap for ports from the corner to fix audio out jack would be very helpful.Delivery was super fast, contactless and on time thanks to Amazon’s amazing delivery service plus I got a 10% discount for Prime day sale !!"
4,For that size full hd ll not to be great idea if you are working close by screen you can see the edged some of the oval objects Because of the TN panel can give you faster respond but if you are not player or once in while playing game it is better to go IPS panel butwhat is the best is ?The software of the BenQ is working nice sensor is very active and usefull if you are working long hours it really nice to have it those sensor no need to adjust screen backlight and also giving so many other option you are not having problem of having huge screen in dark night it doesn’t tire you eyesColor gamut is not really great i am not saying worse but not definitely the best .dark seen in the movies are not good at all
2,1. Audio in Monitor doesn't work2. The Brightness can't be adjusted if brightness intelligent is turned ON3. Not height adjustable
5,"BenQ is the Best Monitor I've used, I've been using BenQ monitors since 2010, & this is my 3rd BenQ monitor that i bought for gaming For my 3rd PC that I Build myself. A TN panel Monitor with Refresh Rate is 75hz with 1ms Response time & 1920x1080 resolution Is Very Good At this Descent Price, You are getting so much. Believe me this is my 3rd BenQ monitor, and the other 2 that I've used in the past were also amazing i still have 1 of them and the one that i bought first i sold 2 years ago & it was working good after 8 years, the 2nd one is still working fine, BenQ is trademark for Monitors, If you've a good budget then you can go for ZOWIE Gaming monitors That is a Subsidiary of BenQ For Gaming Monitors."
3,Picture quality is good but why you mention about speakers. Speakers are  not inside this model.
5,"Purchased 27 inches Benq monitor mainly due to WFH scenario ongoing in our country today. The product delivery and packaging was good. Coming to product, its working as expected. No more headaches due to staring at 14inch screens. Adaptive brightness works like a charm, automatically adjusts the brightness according to daylight vs dusk vs tubelight. Had low blue light - > multimedia, web surfing, office, reading and epaper which helps in reducing the blue light exposure. Would recommend this product for those who need that additional BIG screen which will reduce the stress on your eyes"
4,"I am very satisficed. one complain. it has no brightness control and only have brightness modes. you cannot reduce or increase brightness manually. You have to set certain modes for which brightness is predefined. That is the one I find annoying otherwise, product is very nice. Must go for it if you don't have a long hour job and wearing glass."
5,Peoples in review complained about monitor doesn’t have hdmi cable bought 24 inch monitor for 24 inch monitor they give different cable. They mentioned it in description also. If you buy 27 inch you will get hdmi cable.Monitor has 16 amp 3 pin power cable thats big for many indian sockets. And wire length is small. I am using old monitors power cable. Because 6 to 16 amp converter are not safer. 6 amp cable also work finely with this monitor.I am connecting two laptops in this monitor both worked perfectly.  Received safely and fast delivery.
5,"Good Monitor , Use Reading mode , Surfing mode , Sensor automatically adjust brightness . you cannot hang it on wall . Buttons soft , Assembling very easy , usage and adjustment easy , hight adjustment absent . circular adjustment possible."
4,"i have been using this Benq monitor for couple of months, and every day at least 6 to 8 hours, so far no issues, no stress on eyes. It is good for eyes, however need to monitor the performance for at least one year then only we will know the exact performance of this monitor."
1,"After using it for a few hrs, it started giving headache. Definitely does not have  ""eye care"" tech. Called Customer care and they said they only do an exchange.  If we get more complaints then only we will start the return policy for this product. It's a throw-away item.  Also, it comes with 15 Amp big plug.I am using laptop/desktop for almost 7-8 hrs daily for the last 15 yrs, never had such an issue with other monitors/screens. I should have gone with other reputed brands. :-("
5,"I needed a separate screen for office work and casual gaming. After a lot of research on different models and customer reviews, I decided to get this model which was on sale for 12.6k. It has a decent response time and 75 Hz refresh rate which is good enough for light gaming. If you go for a 144hz monitor you'll have to look for either a smaller size or a larger budget because for 27 in there isn't any good 144hz monitor below 15k.There are several different modes for brightness, especially the low blue light mode which is preferred for long working hours.It's only been 1 day of use so I can't say much but for now, all I can say is there are better options for 24/22 in monitors but for 27 inch this is easily the best one. So go for it. It seems to meet my expectations. If I run into an issue, I will update it here."
5,"Bought this screen for WFH. Had overscan issue initially. Its fixed on running the software provided by BenQ. Display is good. Does not have height adjustment. Has tilt adjustments, no back light bleeding. Decent buy."
4,"I received this BenQ 24"" Monitor which is FHD, it should have HDMI Cable & Audio cable but both these are  not there. It is putting me in difficulty. Can you arrange these cables/ connectors. Otherwise I will have to purchase these from market, quality will be doubtful."
2,Plug provided is 15A socket doesn't fit  standard indian plugThey should inform if they provide any non-standard connector.Overall not happy
5,"People cursing it for being LCD, but the truth is all LED monitors are basically LCD. So the company isn't cheating customers! As per me, best monitor in market. Go for it"
1,"why  ""16 amp 3 pin power cable"" for 35 watts power consuming monitor.  it should be ideally ""5 amp 3pin power cable"" Its very big and can't be plugged and basically considering its power consumption 5amp should be more than enough."
2,"7 August:Purchased10 September:The monitor seemed great and value for money. However, 33 days after the purchase, I started getting electric shocks from my laptop whenever I connected the monitor. I checked and all the ports of the monitor have great electric current discharge. Have filed a complaint today with a request for replacement/repair.Will update periodically."
1,I bought this product due to eye care facilities. Brightness control highly defective. Eye power increased after using it for three months. Wish I can change the product. Picture quality for normal use is below expectation. Software not compatible with windows 10.
5,"Working fine. Happy with the productHas everything that I need. Has automatic sensors which is good. Has reading, web surfing, multi media modes."
4,"Picture quality is very good, useful for work from home. As it mentions it automatically adjusts the brightness but that doesn't seem to be working all the time.And sound is not there for this model, though you can connect speakers."
5,Picture quality is excellentI have taken this monitor for official and personal work and absolutely it's working excellentThanks alot
5,The picture quality and colors are amazing. It's an LED display and different viewing modes don't disappoint at all. It even has automatic brightness adjustment. Has all ports as advertised and comes with hdmi cable. I wish it had discount but it's one is the best choices you can make.
5,Overall a great product 👍🏼
1,"The product quality is very poor, also the picture quality is not good too!"
1,"Two words only ""BAD PRODUCT"" in every field as declared by compony. Don't want to waste my time to list out endless flows of items.Only good thing returned and refunded timely."
4,"I loved this display,"
5,"Best monitor for 1080p gaming...great number of modes, easy operation and all sorts of ports.....more ports offer more flexibility."
4,"Good, I am  happy with  the quick buttons provided to adjust brightness  to my requirement.HDMI cable is not provided which is basic for any connections these daysI had to  spend  another  500 for that"
1,The monitor has so much backlight and glow that the eyes get sore even in 10 minutes of use. The black screen is also litnlike a glowing torch. Dont buy if you care for your eyes. Had to return within 18 hours.
3,"No Proper customer support for short circuit issues, it's been three months that I have registered the complaint but no Proper even with continuous following"
5,Perfect without screen glaring
1,Got the issue with first piece.Got the replacement. It also has the same screen bleeding issues with extra white patches on screen.Please dont go for it.
4,Good
4,"Works as expected for normal office work. the speaker is too feeble, cant use it to take calls. Its of no use."
5,Working very nicely. happy so far
1,"No builtin speaker, no hdmi cable instead  they give vga cable.go for gw2480 this has audio output and give hdmi cable"
5,Cool display monitor
4,The Monitor is perfect. all over its very good. but the display settings are quite complex.
5,"Really happy with this purchase! Also got extra warranty on registering the product on Samsung Website!It serves my purpose of web development, web and graphic designing.For the given price I think the picture quality is really great! I highly recommend this to anyone who is working from home and needs a bigger screen!"
5,I'm using its as a second monitor to my laptop its picture quality is great.It has HDMI cable in the box so no need to buy it separately.
4,Economical and does the job as your second screenNo problem with glare/ eye strain
4,HDMI cable is included and the product is tilt adjustable.  Full HD and I use it for work and stare for 10 hours a day it’s easy on blue light.  A product value for your buck.
5,Best monitor in this price range. Display is clean & crisp. A second screen is must in this WFH situation & this monitor meets the purpose. Over all a great purchase & as usual on time & best delivery by Amazon.
1,The Product Design is not entirely User Friendly. The Settings options being provided behind is clumsy and it really does not help to fix the settings if the button is behind.
4,Decent monitor which could be used as a 2nd monitor in workplace
5,Appropriate size for second screen
5,Good
5,"brilliant monitor for woking, but for gaming and movie you will need bigger monitor."
1,"It doesn't have a remote, sound system (speaker). Tried to return, but only replacement option available."
5,I love it
4,Good product
5,Very good monitor. Working well. Price is also cheap.
4,"Nice Product, good looking and express delivery by the seller.."
5,Very Good Quality
5,Super nice picture quality wonderful
1,Not working
5,Monitor is stunning and has excellent picture quality
5,"Hi Dear,I am very happy to buy this Monitor. Picture quality is good. I was waiting for last three months for amount to be reduced. Finally it is reduced from Rs. 9500 to Rs. 7999. Then 10% cashback offer in My AMEX card.* Picture quality is good* Looking fancy and decent design.* I was brought for this developing purpose. So now feeling good for my eyes working in late night.* HDMI Cable not available only VGA Cable.* Edges are not properly fitted. But okay."
4,"Slim and very stylish monitor. Picture quality is good. I am using macbook so cannot compare to retina display. But at this price point, I would say this is a excellent piece.The highlight is the metal stand which is stylish and sturdy. Many monitors don't have metal Base. I love the Matt finish on the stand and love the black finish.Just got it today. I will see how it goes and update my review if I see anything strange.This product is China made so had to  sterilise it before using. 😂. Just joking."
5,Best product
5,This is the best monitor I could have purchased in a decent budget. I have compared this monitor with every other branded monitor and bought it. It has all the features that a branded monitor has and is budget friendly. It comes with an almost 24 inch wide screen. This is the best find and has an HD resolution with 1980 *1980 pixels. It has a sleek design and comes in silver colour. It can be mounted on a wall or can be put on desk. VGA and HDMI cable is supported. Though the inbuilt speaker is not as good as one can expect but overall a great product from zebronics. If one is looking for a sleek and budget friendly monitor then this product should be one's first choice.
5,My Monitor is suddenly not working properly. Developed Screen resolution patch from below screen. nearly 75%. I need replacement for this. It is under Warranty.
5,"It's good for daily use.Everything is perfect with it.the design with almost zero bezel.no bleeding.But the colours are not vibrant for a Full HD display.not recommend for photo/video editing, gaming etc.best for casual daily use, reading, surfing through net,trading,movies etc.Recommend."
5,Sleek design.. White color makes more stylish.. Picture quality is awesome. Tried both as a TV and monitor.. 1) As a TV: picture quality is very much cool but In built speaker doesn't sounds good. Made only for notification sounds and not much loud.. 2) As a monitor: Blue light filter is much helpful for work from home purpose.. Perfect choice for ppl who are working from home
5,Awesome productImage quality is goodVery satisfied with the product
5,An excellent monitor for the price.  Pictures are sharp and steady at high resolution.
4,I bought this Monitor couple of days back and delivered it swiftly. Thanks for Amazon prime.Pros:Good display sizeGood picture qualityEasy setupCons:Can be provided with better speakerYou can't adjust the viewing angleOverall it's worth the price less than 8K and has a better picture quality than expected. Ran through couple of display test video from YouTube. Passed all test and HD resolution is good.Finally packaging was good small and adequate. Easy to carry for shifting purpose.
5,Good product
5,Good
5,best product at this price.screen is bezeless for immersive view. light weight. clean white color at back.brightness and picture quality is awsome. same experience as big brands at way less price.
5,Fanatic guys
5,Like this product
5,Very good clariy and brightness is good and very satisfied
5,Good for wfh and eyes
5,Excilent
5,Great stylish looking monitor! I am using as a extended screen with my laptop.
5,I would say just buy it.Best qualityVery cheapAmazing
5,Monitor is osm btt some light rays comes out from the display brezzels..and electric current passes out through a screw.. value for money ....
5,Worth it.. Just by if u are a normal user.
5,Best best
5,The product is meeting the expected quality.The form factor is good.Integrate Webcam to make this product in the customer delight category.
4,"Excellent design, especially back side.Very narrow Basel and slim.Good finishing and colour, useful in offices where it is visible from backside too.In built speakers.Only one thing, all the connection sockets are backward, so wall fixing difficult.No indicator in front side."
5,monitor at a good price and its value for money
5,Goog
5,Nice 👍
1,"By comparing the 1. Pics from the product description, 2. Pics posted by other customers in the review section and 3. Pics I have attached with this review, it would be evident that the product I received is completely different. i.e the back projection is bigger than the original, stand fixing arrangements are different, shape/size and cutout in the stand are different, description on the adaptor is different.How can a product from a branded company like zebronics differ when the model no. in the product description on amazon and on the product I received is the same. This proves that clearly, I have received a duplicate/first copy products.Further, if you can see the 4th pic I uploaded, the screw hole given to fix the stand is useless, as the hole is inside the monitor body and the screw can't be inserted."
5,Gud looking clear pic quality & lowest cost worthy of purchase
4,Moniter is good one but stand is not adjustable. Screen is looking some in band position. When seating in front of screen it is very awkward position to work on monitor. My samsung monitor was adjustable. And one more thing wall mountain clamp was not received
5,*Picture quality is amazing.*superb thin Display.*Available inbuilt speaker.*Natural Colours.*Value for Money.*Just go for it.
5,Good quality
5,Nice product.
5,Best display. But if you want to buy it for speaker look for any other monitor.
5,SERVES THE PURPOSE VERY WELL AS THE PICTURE QUALITY IS UPTO THE MARK AND THE MONITOR IS REALLY VERY SLIM IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
5,Overall best
5,Awasum monitor
5,This is real zero bazal monitor very very very good monitor very good picture quality extra wide
1,"I bought this product and received delivery on 11 november. Installed it. it is basically screw based mechanism without any tilt arrangement. Ideally we expect a height adjustment as well but tilt adjustment is such a basic feature to have to set a monitor ergonomically and work tirelessly.but unforturnately, this monitor is not even perfectly straight. it is tilted towards front/user. this makes viewing and working very diffuclt.apart from that there is blur in side edges which isnt upto an LG standards for monitors.buy a better product. and please know that amazon doesnt gives easy returns nowadays. they have some policies to issue refund only when they dont have a replacement available. they have told me to provide a return on some conditions, but am not pleased with their return policy, because when you make a buy they clearly write return or replacement available till 19 november, but will offer only replacement when you buy products..so please make a informed decision regarding electronic products. you decide for your hard earned money,"
5,"I changed my monitor after a decade, and boy am I loving this one. I was put in a spot as I was confused whether I should get a 27"" 4k monitor or a 29"" 1080p ultrawide. I wanted a monitor that could be great for work, as well as for entertainment.From a productivity point of view, I love the extra screen real estate. Can work with Excel sheets without scrolling to the right all the time. Split screen mode doesn't require you to squint your eye due to the wider screen. I've plugged both my personal laptop and office laptop to the monitor via HDMI and switch between them seamlessly. The 99% sRGB 10 bit panel makes it a good buy for designers and video editors as well.Watching movies on this monitor is sweet. There are no black bars as most movies are shot in 21:9 ratio, same as this monitor. It's quite immersive. The colour reproduction of this monitor is spot on. The 10 bit panel with HDR is the cherry on top. Keep in mind that most YouTube videos are still in 16:9 ratio. So watching them on this monitor would be equivalent to a 22"" widescreen (16:9) monitor.When I played Assassin's Creed : Valhalla, and Control on this monitor, the colours were popping and it was hella immersive. I couldn't figure out the HDR settings for the game, but it looked so good without HDR itself. I did not have a noticeable performance drop despite the monitor having a higher resolution than a normal 1080p monitor. The 75Hz panel made the gaming experience a tad bit smoother as well.If I have to be nitpicky about anything at all, it would be the backlight bleed. LG has done a good job minimizing the backlight bleed, and it is leagues better than the Samsung monitor which I used to have earlier. Being an IPS LCD monitor, this is expected, and for this price, I wouldn't complain at all. Only better thing would be AMOLED or OLED monitors, that are comparatively expensiveI'd highly recommend this monitor as a one stop buy for their productivity, binging and gaming needs."
3,Monitor is good for content creation but the build quality and plastic material is very bad did not expected from LG and I think there should be and height adjustment for this price point the plastic body is very low qualityDon't think twice if you want to do content creation work because the screen size is very BIG I think it's sufficient don't go for 34 inches save your money 29 inch is good enough just got today I am writing this review really will update in future the detailed review
1,"For the people, who are trying to buy this, let me tell you one thing, this is bigger than it looks in images. This is a good monitor overall.It is too big for my setup, so I wanted to return it the very same day.  But I cannot because Amazon has removed the return policy for all electronic products. So please be aware before you buy this. You cannot return it. I have to sell it at a secondhand price now. I guess it's a new way of milking as much money from customers."
3,"If you are used to working on laptops and regular sized monitors which have decent pixel density, you are going to be disappointed by the pixel density of this monitor. You can see the individual pixels. Single pixel thick lines in - say stock market charts - appear glitchy. For the image to look sharp on a 34"" monitor, it should be at least be 4k is what I've realized. This product was not returnable so I kept it.The built in speakers are terrible and I am not even an audiophile. The sound is very rounded/muffled and reverbs a lot.I could not get the LG software to work on my machine, but I guess that problem could have been sorted. I didn't bother.I was hoping that this monitor had a feature were you could plug-in two HDMIs and use two computers side by side by in a split screen arrangement. There is no such feature.I got headaches using this monitor from regular distance. This went on work a few weeks after which I got used to it.Build quality is good. Looks impressive on the desk.I bought this monitor because I need lot of screen space for my programming tools, and other multi-tasking work. The obvious fact that I missed is that the total resolution is just as much as 2 1080p monitors kept side by side, which is okay but still half that of 4k! A 4K would give me more screen space and also improve the sharpness of the picture.It has a 3.5 mm jack in the back which can be used to connect headset but it does not support mic, so good for listening, not for voice calls etc. I don't know if this is a limitation of this monitor or the HDMI standard.I bought it for around 33K which was not a good value for money for this monitor.What you should buy instead:4K is a must!Look for features in monitor and accompanying software which let you connect two (or more) PCs simultaneously. In WFH scenario, you might want to use office and personal laptop with the same monitor, if so then switching must be easy. Some kind of screen splitting feature which takes input from different sources would be nice to have.Best would be a monitor with built in USB hub and Audio/Mic jacks and a button/remote that allows you to switch all peripherals from one PC to another without physically plugging out  mouse/keyboard/headset from one and plugging them into another.Alternative is to use KVM HDMI switch with USB if you don't mind the clutter."
5,"Must buy. I did a lot of research on what model to buy and what size.. 25 29 34 inchWN WL UM etc 500 600 69Finally narrowed down on WN600It looks small but is a perfect solution for what it's intended forThis is the 29"" 2020 model and should support dual controller (not tested yet)Ask me any questions that you may have"
4,"Buy a better resolution monitor at this size. The words get stretchy and kind of pixelate. My eyes strained for 2-3 days and I got migraine as it was my first time working on a this big sized monitor. But gradually my eyes got used to it. The speakers work well, I have no problem with them opposed to many videos that say otherwise. You should have a bigger desk too to have a good distance otherwise your eyes will strain a lot."
5,"I am using LG monitors from years and this is third monitor I've purchased of LG. Picture and color quality is great and sound is great if you are not used to a 5.1 system. I am using both 5.1 sound system and monitor sound because this monitor can play clearer dialogues than 5.1. If you are using HDR10 setting in windows then some of the picture mode are disabled in this monitor. One other great feature of this monitor is that you can switch picture mode by windows software called ""Onscreen Control"" , so I can easily switching between picture modes from windows without touching physical key on monitor.  I am using low brightness and contrast in reading and browsing and switch it to cinema or gaming mode in viewing movies and playing game. I advice to use display port cable instead of HDMI cable comes with this monitor for less eye strain due to higher refresh rate."
5,"When I placed the order the monitor came and it was a faulty one as half of the screen was appearing as blurred you can see the attached picture, same day I requested a replacement and then it turn out to be great display with amazing sound quality. At this price point this 8s the best ultrawide monitor one can purchase.."
4,"Good --- Amazing picture quality || White Monitor with modern looks || White HDMI giving me 60Hz || White Adaptor which is slim (looks like an adaptor for laptop, btw fits into my Sony Vaio E as well)  || Good Speakers+ I really like this whenever I play XBOX, visuals and sound are amazing.Bad --- INR 18100 spent (almost 3000 more than other models of LG), but its ""Dual Control"" application (""Dual Controller 2.65 for Windows"") does not work at all. I checked with the LG Customer care, and explained this issue to several engineers, but nobody has replied me yet. (Looks that it does not have Picture By Picture (PBP) feature in 29 inch, btw not sure if 34 inch monitor has it or not)Visible screen length is 67.5 cm and height is 29 cm of the 29 inch monitor.Length is sufficient for 12+ hours daily work (b'cuz 34 inch monitor might be an issue for the eyes if you are online for more than 12 hours daily), but Height should be a bit more.It has two HDMI and one DisplayPort, Thanks!, but shuffling between two laptops is not so comfortable. Each time I had to click on the button and make the selection (it must be a single click feature).Hence, now I am using ""Farraige®HDMI Switch Splitter"""
1,"Power adopter for this monitor stopped working. Raised a ticket to LG customer care, however they told that they don't have power adopters available and hence cannot fix it. They closed the ticket as well without my permission. So buy this only on your own risk knowing that if this stops working, there may not be any service available. Monitor is otherwise ok and does it's job."
5,"The quality of this monitor is just too good based on this price section. I got it for 26k in great indian festival.This monitor is perfect for gaming, working, trading.The HDR 10 feature is more like a gimmick but it does the job pretty well.Picture quality is just too good man.And the built in speaker is always quiet good. It will do the job until you buy some separate speaker for your whole system.Yoou can also connect headphone directly in the monitor and it works like a charm."
5,"If you are looking for big landscape for looking simultaneous docs, video editing, stock charts then this is the one to go for. The text and picture quality is superb at 2560x1080 resolution with in built audio good enough. Split screen and Dual connection all works smoothly.If you use DP to HDMI converter for laptop, make sure it supports up to 4k, or else you will not get the above resolution."

3,"This is a good monitor considering a fact that there are very few options for ultra-wide monitors, especially at this price range. However, 1080p on a 29 inch monitor looks pixelated, especially more so as you’ll be working closer to the monitor, in comparison with a TV.The HDR mode seems off-the-line a bit and sometimes over-saturates the colour to provide very bad image quality. I’d restrain from purchasing this if you’re working more on photo editing, gaming or video editing stuff. You get a lot of good 4K 16:9 monitors at this price point or better get a 25 inch one if you’re in need of an ultra-wide monitor."
5,"A perfect monitor for those who are working from home. Yes you can get a larger monitor or a 4K one at around the same price, but the ability to have 2 windows side by side on an ultrawide is something office work will benefit from hugely! Even movies look great on this aspect ratio.Coming to the Speakers, they sound good for a monitor, don't expect much bass, but for calls or movie/tv show watching, it'll suffice. Don't forget to use Maxxaudio option to get the best sound from this monitor."
5,I researched a lot and then decided to buy this even though there were some other alternatives from LG offered for a lower price but keep in mind that they are old models. It is working fine with my macbook pro 2019 with a usb c dock and I assume will work with a usbc to hdmi as well.The picture quality is really good and even the colours are nice. Wouldn’t recommend it if your main purpose is to watch movies or videos as it seems a bit odd to watch movies in this ratio.
5,"Saw the review & wanted to upgrade, trust me this is value for money . amazing screen clarityworth an upgrade"

5,"Ment for multitasking. Ultrawide makes sense in 34"". Usability increases to a deferent level alltogether. Bezels are descently thick, would have appreciated bezelless design. Monitor sound is descent not great, can't expect more from a monitor speaker. Overall a nice good product, one of best Ultrawide monitors available at this price tag,"
2,"Seemed like a good deal but doesn't work smoothly with my Macbook pro 15"". And after a month of slow use, the screen seems to have blanked out. Please help?!"
4,"The screen is amazing , ultra wide I can easily work with multiple programs open which is a big plus in today’s work from home environment . Text is clear , graphics smooth . The inky reason I have not 5 starred is because the screen does not have inbuilt height adjustment which should be a given ."
5,"Really good monitor. No complaints till now. There is no back-light bleed. Using this for coding as well as gaming. Hdr is also good.Do note, don't turn on SUPERRESOLUTION. It just makes everything more pixelated."
1,"I received a defective monitor (screen keeps flickering) on 23rd Nov. I called amazon support on 25th Nov and they said the product will be picked up in 3 day.No pick up happened so I called again on 29th and several more times in the next few days but no pick up or refund is initiate. Tomorrow is the last day for replacement request, I am really worried its 26.2K down the drain."
5,Excellent quality. Changed my working style.
5,"If you are planning to buy widescreen,dont go with 34 inch with 2560*1080 resolution...You should go with 29 inch with 2560*1080..and this monitor is best"
1,"Suddenly stopped working after 2 months, also doesn't have PIP mode"
5,The product is good. I would say its better that any monitor in this price range. Go for it!
5,"I am just amazed by the picture quality it has. I always wanted bigger screen and was looking for 27 inch monitor for multitasking, but after watching some reviews online, I decided to buy this and it has served the purpose 100% for me at least. Complete value for money!"
1,"Pros:Colors are good enough but over saturated even after calibrationviewing angles are excellentNo dead pixelsno ghosting if you change the settings properly....Cons:not suitable to watch moviesIt only comes with a display port cable ,if u want to connect to a laptop you have to buy a cable  separatelyBottom bezel gets slightly warm ,update: bottom bezel heating is a problem, waiting for a refund ,its taking forever to get a refund ,really bad service by amazon.:("
1,"Dont buy this product, my screen broke from inside in 1 month and now the LG Represetative are asking me for 17000 to repair the screen. I paid 22000 for this screen and they want 17000 on top of it. Stay away from LG and this screen. I dont usually leave reviews but I have been scammed, so dont buy this screen because you might get scammed too!"
5,"Coming from 4k 60hz 24""(LG 24UD58-B), I was concerned about going 32"" 1440p as ppi would be much less, but after using 32GK650F-B, I can surely say 1440p looks gorgeous on 32"". Who cares about ppi when text and image looks good enough.In current day and age, 1440p 144hz is the holy-grail for gamers, which is even better on 32"" inch with fantastic LG VA panel for its deep blacks and 3000:1 contrast ratio.What LG 32GK650F-B gets right?1. 144Hz✅2. 1440p QHD✅3. Fantastic 32"" VA panel✅4. FreeSync(Works as G-Sync Compatible with zero glitch)✅5. 1ms Motion Blur Reduction(FreeSync off)✅6. Zero backlight bleed(on my unit, feeling lucky!)✅What could be even better👍1. A 27"" varient for proper 1440p(QHD) experience.2. FreeSync 2.3. VESA certified HDR 400 (at least).4. 10-bit panel.5. For LG, why not bring higher-tier GK850, GK950, Nano-IPS, and G-Sync varients of Ultra Gear monitors to India?My first 1440p 144hz 32"" VA experience has been ecstasy❤Thanks LG👍Thanks Amazon for on-time defect-less product delivery👍"
5,"Awesome. Upgrade from 60hz to 144hz. Super smooth gaming ,browsing. Don’t worry about dp cable,i am installed monitor with hdmi cable and got 144hz,just enable 144 in your display adapter properties in pc, also can enable in games. And u can check it is working on 60 or 144 in your monitor settings press monitor keys.go for it. So sharp panel. Love to play battlefield 5 on 144hz can see every detail. Very high details.Also one more thing:—- lg Sony Samsung are way better than acer aoc benq. I got in 15499."
5,This is an awesome monitor FOR THE PRICE ..It is hugeee and along with 144hz this is the best buy...Make sure u have enough desk space... I sit approx 2 feet away from the screen
5,"Great monitor, compatible with g-sync also."
5,"As an TN Panel you might need to adjust colour settings according to your need after entering all the settings display looks very nice, 144hz with 1ms response time is 👌. Also freesync with NVIDIA G-Sync compatible, for enabling G-Sync you will display port connector. G-Sync is not available over HDMI."
5,"I got it on on18th Oct 2019, Ordered on 16th Oct 2019. Got it for 21k (22k-1K cashback) during Amazon Festival.The product is on point, amazing display. Upgraded from 23 inches 120hz 1080p Samsung IPS Panel.I am really enjoying this VA panel. G-Sync Works. Colour Accuracy is good, Overall the display is one of the best used.Ps- 32 inches is big, make sure you watch/play from a distance.Don't even think, this screen is a steal even till 25k."

Most problems appear in the earliest hours of use so that you can initiate a replacement!Note, this is a VA Panel, NOT TN.  Picture quality wise still IPS wins. Limitations of IPS panels are response time and refresh rates, which is why TN panels are preferred by some gamer despite compromise on picture quality. VA panels stand somewhat in between TN and IPS, without compromise on picture quality much lets you enjoy both the worldsIn Box contains CD (for manual), Monitor unit, Stand set, Display cable, power adapter set,Important Facts:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~♦ This is a VA panel, picture quality is better, good viewing angle than a TN♦ Typical Response time is ~8ms Grey-to-Grey, max being 4ms (1ms is for motionblur reduction, NOT Response time); TN panels are really faster♦ FreeSync and 1ms Motion blur CANNOT be used at same time, anyway I didn't see 1ms MBR any difference!♦ 144Hz and 1ms MBR works together♦ With QHD, 1440p you need a good GPU starting from GTX 1060 or GTX1660 at least♦ 144Hz is smooth and very noticeable for window dragging, mouse but watching movies or videos no difference♦ Playing on 144Hz for games are good, but unless your GPU pushes beyond 100 FPS, this monitor is of NO BIG DEAL♦ Didn't feel need for 4K, pictures are reasonably sharp for 32""inch dimension, plus 4K needs a beast gpu!♦ HDMI mostly on current devices caps at 60Hz, so Laptop holders don't even imagine 144Hz monitors!♦ Slight blur at the corners are noticeable (if you lean left and watch the right side)♦ 4 level of adjustments (Height, Swivel, Tilt & rotate), programmers can rotate 90 deg and read upto 200 lines of code in one stretch!Tested on my RTX2060, games such as Crew2, Forza Horizon 4, Just cause 4, Project Cars 2. All I could get was ~70-110 Fps with max graphic config. So don't fall prey for 144Hz gaming if your hardware lacks the power.So is it worth to buy?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~♦ If you have a powerful GPU which can keep upwards of 100 fps in most games♦ If priced under 25K, reasonably♦ If you want reasonable picture quality (VA) but also 144HzDon't buy if your graphics card is not powerful or if your GPU doesn't have a display port!Note, you need a table at least of 30 inches in length, the monitor covers almost everything on your table!Hope this helps"
1,"First order, product came with a dead pixel, returned the product, received another, and it was flickering, so many hardware issues, i think they are sellong defective products here, all these people' here are complaining before too, but i didnt listen and bought it, now they are saying they will refund my money when they receive my product. But if you get a working piece of it, it works so fine. Cause wih one dead pixel it was workig fantastic."
5,"Using this display as a secondary monitor strictly for gaming along with my LG 34UC87.Pros:1.1080p 240Hz and other bundled features sweet spot for gaming.Simply no nonsense interface.Gsync compatible no matter what Nvidia says.Using it with 1080ti.Buttery smooth -Siege/PUBG (Pc & Lite).2.Flexibility of placement on your desk (portrait/landscape), Height adjustable.3.Price.240Hz at this price is a steal any day.4.Cables bundled-DP/HDMI.(Would use a DP for 144hz n above though)5.Design.Hate it or love it  Red n Black Theme.6. I am more inclined towards 27"" 1080p 240hz against 24' 1080p 240Hz.Bigger the better.(better head visibility?)Cons:1. Color.Wont use it for any other purpose other than gaming.Don't get me wrong here its pretty decent for gaming but for movies, photo/ video editing I stick to my other monitor.Definitely recommended for gamers."
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. For some 32 inch is bit big. Make sure you have enough desk space before purchasing it. This is an VA panel. Which has some good and bad thing too. Out of the box color is not Accurate, you need to adjust a bit to get the best results. Set the Black level to Low, color temp to cool & Gamma to mode 1. With gamer profile 1. This will make the colors much better.Now, don't expect this to be as good as IPS Panel when it comes to color performance. But as I said earlier it has its own unique good advantage.Good things...✅With this VA panel you can get amazing level of blacks. I never seen better black level on any monitor before. It's simply amazing. If you use monitor in dark room then This is the one for you. Because of the 3000:1 contrast ratio black levels are pure black, no or minimal Back light bleeding which is great for watching movies and games which has dark scenes.✅QHD resolution in 32-inch panel is similar to 24 inch 1080p in terms of PPI. So it's really crisp and clear you will love it. Just make sure you got enough GPU power to handle it.✅ experiencing 144Hz refresh rate is actually amazing. Coming from 60hz I can say this is something every one should experience to enjoy. Not only gaming even on desktop while using windows UI or scrolling is buttery smooth.✅with this monitor AMD Freesync works great with Nvidia GPU'S as well. (Series 10 and beyond)Not so good things...❌ Viewing angles are not that good. Honestly if even you sit properly in the middle you will notice color shifting and dark areas on the edge of the display because 32 inch is pretty big for and monitor. So if you sin on the middle still edge of the display will be far from Your FOV. It's not a deal breaker but it's something that sometime really annoying. For up or down or side this panel doesn't show Accurate color. Color and brightness always shifts a bit. Not a big problem of you sit and watch from middle. For best viewing angle you have to get IPS Monitor.❌ overall colors are not Accurate as IPS, though it's depends on your preference. For me I like more Deeper blacks and high contrast for gaming and movies. Acurate colors don't matter for me. What matters is which looks good on screen. That's why I love this monitor. But if you are doing photo editing or multimedia works then this is not for you. Get the IPS Panel (10 bit if possible) which has Accurate color but average blacks.❌ No HDR support. Though with 350nits of brightness HDR won't work good. But still better than nothing.🔰Overall I can say I enjoyed watching movies and playing games on this big screen. With HDR support it would have been a perfect purchase. If you don't care about HDR or super Accurate color then go ahead and purchase it. Tested with PS4 also and loved it. Colors are punchy, super bright display. Big size with high refresh rate with Freesync ang G-Sync support. What more could you ask?❓My personal experience : I received a nearly flawless unit from Amazon. No BLB, NO dead pixels. Manufactured 06/2020. imported 07/2020 Great service from Amazon and seller appario retail private Ltd.BUT I noticed that on my unit the bottom bezel gets too hot after few minutes of use. As much hot like I couldn't touch it without hurting my fingers. That was the deal breaker for me. I got worried it might even catch fire."
1,"Ordered frm appario Retail and the unit i got has whole display screen bleeding, color calibration out of the box is so trash, Opted for Replacement and got another defective unit which has Red stuck pixel on Left side, Worst display panel by LG. update : tried DOTA 2 with gtx 1060 6 gb and even with display cable when turned on gsync, dota 2 had screen tearing and ghosting, Not for dota players, I had to refund."
5,"Pros:I wrote cons in my first review, with the frustration on ""No 10 Bit color depth"". After I kept on understanding specifications from various sources and experimenting with them, I found this is the best Monitor for both work and gaming, best of both worlds! I came to know LG discarded HDR in an essence to pack the best of both worlds at the mid segment price range (INR 25 k to 30 k). I saw similar models in ACER and ViewSonic.Comparison of the current model LG 32GK650 (GK) with LG 32QN600 (QN), its equivalent at more or less same price, as follows:(1) GK has Gaming features. QN do not have.(2) Both have 32"" display and are QHDs.(3) GK has VA Panel. QN has IPS. I understood that the quality of panel ranges from IPS to VA to TN. Gaming is good with VA including video editing, along with usual tasks such as document reading / writing, programming etc. Core video editors can give more inputs on video editing with VA, not me.(4) Contrast ratio is 3000:1 for GK, while it is 1000:1 for QN. This is limitation with IPS. I thoroughly enjoyed this high contrast ratio.(5) Black Stabilizer (BS) is a great feature in both models that is opposite to Brightness. A low of BS and high of Brightness, turned the 16.7 million colors look like HDR 10. I watched Netflix run on Google Chrome (GC).  Also I kept GC to run on NVIDIA graphic card. Just stunning!(6) Refresh Rate (RR) is 144 Hz in GK and 75 Hz in QN. Your input device should be compatible to give the RR. For example, you have 15 Full HD laptop (1080p) at 60 Hz. Upon connecting to GK at 1440p display, it would work at 60Hz only and not at 144 Hz. Similarly for Gaming consoles! HDMI cable also plays role. GK has HDMI 2.0 slot. if you connect HDMI 2.1 cable with no backward compatibility, then it will be a trouble! Also with HDMI 1.4 cables, it would be trouble as well.(7) GK has VESA stand that is highly flexible and has deel Gaming look.(8) For GK, the Display has FPS, RTS, Read, Game 1 & 2 Modes. I am using Read mode heavily for text reading, powerpoint editing and watching web based training videos from Udemy. Absolutely, I did not feel any strain, despite I sit very close to monitor for long hours.Cons:(1) HDR10 is a miss in GK but QN has it! But managed the color settings with Black Stabilizer & High Contrast.(2) Dual Controller (DC) is a miss in GK but QN has it! If this is SOFTWARE ONLY feature, LG should notify on patch upgrade as download from their site. The DC feature helps in working on 2 laptop/PC simultaneously in a single display with just 1 keyboard and mouse! This will help us to avoid spending money on multi device keyboard and mouse!"
4,"Don't let the reviews fool you, it's just an ok monitor, it's not the best, but it's also not the worst.The backlight bleed is horrible, the colours are ok, but you won't be making any use of it for content creation. It might have audio output, but it lacks decent volume and it's not a combo jack that means you're gonna have to connect your headphone/headset microphone separately, I find it much better when connected to the motherboard directly. HDMI + DP input means that you can use multiple systems without the hassle of changing cables every now and then (HDMI for your console or any other media device and DP for your pc)FreeSync works fine, and if you're using an Nvidia gpu you're gonna need a DP cable to make it work as Nvidia doesn't support FreeSync over HDMI.The stand is robust, but if your fan is directly above the monitor and is running at full speed it's gonna wobble quite a bit. I got it for around 15k, so I can say it's ok for that price. Would've loved at least one or 2 usb outputs or at least a better audio output. Comes with an HDMI cable, I don't use it I've got a good quality Q3 cable that works flawlessly.Gaming experience was good, no screen tearing thanks to FreeSync, pretty good response time for competitive games, I enjoy playing CSGO, Overwatch and GTA V and have no complaints with my gaming experience.Update: got a dead pixel so filed for a replacement, will update when the next unit arrives."
1,"While the monitor is fine, the seller appario retail is sending the same faulty unit over and over again to different customers. My package had labels from atleast 3different shipping seems like and when I tried to use it it did not work on display port. Avoid Appario retail for this monitor"
1,"Got this monitor because of the good reviews.Works well for gaming and in general, but the first one i got have noticeable black light bleed.So got it replaced by an other one and when tested for black light bleed even the this one had it.In the end had to opt for refund since i couldn't settle for a monitor which has black light bleed out of the box."
5,"Absolutely my best purchase from amazon. And nothing can go wrong with LG IPS panels, the colours are too good. Only thing is, not a cons given the price is 36k, the brightness seems to be a little on the lower side making the HDR10 worthless. But then if you want HDR in this, you have to shell out a hefty money.Pretty happy with it. Also, some people said that the DPI is low for 34 inch, believe me, without a magnifying glass or binoculars you wont notice that."
4,I will not go long in this one....You can read my first review I wrote everything .Almost after 30 days of usage.At first when I upgraded from 60 hz to 144 hz things while practicing were so amooth and in main games also....In main games while so much is going on having so much fos ...at first I was unable to track people (talking in fortnite) knew because of the new refresh rate...After 2-3 days I became used to it...it helped me getting more W and kills my Ratings have gone up on worldwide ranking...... You'll get the advantage if your good enough and you think your hardware is holding u back...go for it...you won't regret....I will buy a 240hz as well wink winkThis monitor is actually amazing ...Worth the money...Never thought of it as a bad decision.
5,"I waited a long time for this monitor: 31.5 inches, 144-165Hz and G-Sync.Must say that I use this monitor as the main device. Perfect for gaming. If you want to do video and photo editing with it, it should be said that you can use this monitor for ""normal"" home use. But you shouldn't expect miracles. Of course, this can't get to other UHD resolution and IPS panel in the market which will cost you 1.3lakhs. But it wasn't built for that.Also, a monitor at almost 32 inches doesn't have to be curved, in my opinion. I now have two of this size on the table and am very happy with it. The monitor is right in front of me and the size is just perfect for me.Positive:- no pixel errors- very well lit.- Colors are okay, (AMVA) Va panel is typical- G-Sync is a dream. Always had problems with tearing on Ubi-soft titles- 144Hz or 165Hz 😊- 31.5 inches 😊- short and clear menu tour (you can quickly find your way around)- Cables are all long enough for me (monitor is right next to the tower)Neutral:- yes, on the edges the picture looks a bit soft. You can see it very well on a white background. A curved display would probably help. But not disturbing for me. In the heat of the moment, you don't give it any meaning or it is not visible.- yes, the USB ports on the back (unfortunately for me) are not quite as suitable. I personally would have preferred a side mounting to quickly connect a stick or hard drive. But here too you can remedy the situation with e.g. a USB hub.- yes, the setting options for color, gamma, color profiles, etc. are very limited. Nevertheless, the picture is completely fine for me and that says someone who has a monitor with IPS panel with 100% sRGB coverage as a second device.- FPS indicator for displaying in the game is missing (I would have liked). But here I use MSI Afterburner and can, therefore, display even more data.- Different profiles cannot be created or saved.For me, however, the ready-made profiles are enough for gaming and nothing else this monitor should be able to do for me.It is a monitor for gamers and for me it fulfills it 100%."
5,"This monitor is truly a blessing for people who want to run multiple applications at the same time along with the best gaming experience which is fueled by the Nvidia Gsync.You have 2 game modes to choose from and it allows you to adjust the other settings including HDR, Power lED light, response time, etc.The packing was good and took less than 5mins to assemble and it's height-adjustable as well which is the best part of this monitor.Overall- very good monitor- if you have the budget, go for it."
1,"Worst white balance ever I saw .. it’s not showing red as red.. also I see pixel distort..I really don’t know how people rated this product as 4+ stars..  I have other LG monitor , where I same picture with good colour but when I switch that pic to this monitor red . showing as pink.. I tried all the colour correction nothing worked.. and about pixel distortion not able to do anything..It’s doesn’t come with dp cable only HDMI cable is provided in box.."
5,Fabulous Monitor.144hz works like a charm and I cannot go back to 60hz now.Everything is so smooth and colour reproduction is also fantastic.Go for it and you will not regret buying this piece over its peers.I bought it for 15490 and the next day sale got started and the price went down to 14490 but I am not unhappy as it is way better than similarly equipped monitors from other manufacturers.One word- Awesome.
5,"this is such a great display, I am a programmer and I use this display as my primary display, the 32 inch is just perfect, I had doubts in my mind if it was going to be too big, but I was wrong.Yes, it did feel very big on the first 2-3 days, but from then onwards it felt normal, its a great size to have on your desk, but u should have a big desk for a better experience, at least a medium-size one. The color is great, brightness is also very high, I am using it at 10% brightness because I spend my whole day in front of the pc and I don't want to get a spectacle soon.I have not played any games on it so I can't say anything about gaming performance, but I am sure it will be great because I have seen many reviews where this monitor has been the best entry-level monitor according to them for gaming.There were no dead pixels, the packaging was good, arrived without any damage.one concern is that you don't get an HDMI cable with it but u do get a display port cable with is good and of great quality too but most pcs doesn't come with a display port, I bought an HDMI cable from the local market at 200 rs (lapcare), I got it for 24k, then after few days, it was brought down to 23,500, my bad. and I was also looking for bajaj finserv but it was only provided for 6 months so I took it for 4000 for 6 months plan again after a few days after bajaj finserv provided 2000 for 12 months plan, again my bad. I have seen a review where they claim they got it for 22k, so if u can wait, wait for it./*******************************************  for programmers:-*******************************************/# => I use visual studio code (obviously). and at a font size of 18 pixels(minimum size to be able to see the character), I can have 3 tabs side by side opened, and each tab can display 94 characters per line (300 character per line if only one tab is open) which is just amazing.# => you can see so much of the code at the same time.# => at 10% brightness and considering my room lighting and dark mode, I don't strain my eyes much even after working for 14 hours a day. so you would be very happy with the monitor.# => even though it's a VA panel, I have no problems with it. It is a  great display, and u will love it."
5,"I mainly ordered this for my xbox one x as an alternative to TV. It totally supports 120Hz at 1080p though xbox games are capped 30FPS but due to 120Hz you will definitely notice the smoothness. Picture quality is also amazing and overall you will be satisfied. If you have more budget I would totally recommend to go for the 27"" display as you will get 1440p @120Hz. Also for the records, I used the HDMI cable provided with the monitor for 120Hz display and it's working fine.Games which I mostly play are MMOs such as Division 2, Destiny 2, Cod Warzone, etc.PS: I also tested this monitor with my PS4 as well and great results with variable refresh rate.Good purchase! 5/5"
3,"Writing my review after using couple of days with all kind of testing.  First if all, Monitor is designed specifically for Gamers(CONSIDER NOTHING ELSE).  also very bulky monitor. After using this 2K monitor observed that 2K is good till 27 Inch monitor.  1440p is does not look good at all with 32 inch.  I have tested with my Windows and Macbook Pro, 2K resolution is just not sufficient with 32 inch. I would strongly not recommend those who are not a GAMER.  I brought for dual use for game and work. but  not at all satisfied for work, for game is ok. WATCHING MOVIE IN THIS MONITOR IS WORST EXPERIENCE."

1,Got a defective piece. The packaging looks previously opened and highly damaged. The HDMI ports have serious connectivity issues. Pretty sure they are selling defective products considering screens that have an mrp of 60k are being sold at 30k.
4,"I was hesitant about buying a 32 inch monitor since the previous 27 inch one was very adequate. Then there was the option of flat or curved. Myriad research later opted for this LG 32"" flat one.  So far after 2 days of usage I am not disappointed.  I sit around 3-4 feet from the monitor. Those who sit less than that, I would advise to stick with smaller screens topping at 27"".144 Hz refresh, FreeSync, 1ms response time (Although all 3 are not meant to work together) @ affordable cost and backed by the reputable LG brand, thats the beauty of this monitorThere are zero dead pixels and no noticable light bleed. Lucky Me !The colour calibration of the screen was the only issue, since there is no calibration software by LG and some existing free software felt woefully short. Windows in-built calibration was inadequate. Finally it was after elongated trial and error, putting a visual, adjusting settings, changing visual, rechecking, which did the trick. But Monitor brands MUST, by default, have their own customised calibration software.All in all I would recommend go for it if you want a quality gaming monitor @ reasonable cost."
1,"For games and videos, this is good. However, if you want to see text screens like C++ in visual studio, this monitor is hopeless."
5,"I had been looking for a 144Hz monitor for a long time. I did all my research about the refresh rates, display panels response time and FreeSync, GSync. After going through all the current options in my budget, the best monitor which I could find was BenQ XL2411. I didn't came to know to about this LG monster that time somehow. All of a sudden, in an Amazon sale, I found this beast. Compared it straight to BenQ model straight away and found it superior to that. Order it for around 13,500 at that without wasting any a moment.On arrival, it was really well packed. It was easy to install, changes my setting from 60Hz to 144Hz and could suddenly feel the difference. The screen was now much more smooth and less jittery. The colors were however on the little bit higher side and were not normal when compared to IPS screen. It took me time to adjust to these settings. However, now whenever I look at any other screen, I find them dim. I have been using it for 3 months now and haven figured any issue yet.When it comes to gaming, I used it for CS:GO mainly. Visuals were great, enemies were much more visible, lag-less display, easy one-taps just because you could feel the moment and enemies don't teleport anymore as their movements were smooth. There were no more hidden spots anymore where I couldn't figure out an enemy. For CS:GO and other FPS, it is highly recommended. When I switched to NFS, the colors were bleeding i.e a lot of exposure in the game colors. Nothing bad but not just what the game wants us to see. It was not that much crisp.Overall, it is a good option to go for consider the different color settings it has along with Black Equaliser as well.  Definitely value for money and a got to go option if you wish to 144Hz from 60Hz"
5,"We don't have many options for a 32"" Gaming Monitor (2k or 4k) with at least 144hz refresh rate in India, as lot of models available in US are never released here. I would have loved to find something with an IPS panel but its impossible with this budget.My use case was primarily gaming+Netflix, so wanted a 32"" to be able to enjoy both. This is probably the best option at this point (even though this was released 2yrs back). I use this with my 3060ti+5600x, no issues with G-sync over Display port. Colors look a little dull compared to IPS, but with some minor tweaks, its not very noticeable. Luckily I got a panel with no dead pixels, so that was a win. Anyone looking for a larger 2k monitor, please go ahead with this, nothing compares to this under 35k."

3,"I have been using this monitor for almost A YEAR now. Bought it for 15300/- back then.Picture quality is good, great brightness and colour calibration but the build quality is not. The edges of the glass panel are not smooth and seamless You will notice it as soon as you sit in front. The plastic protective bezel around the glass display is of really cheap quality and paint has started to chip. Pixel pitch is okay (about 116 I think) if you use this monitor from a 2 feet of distance. NOT recommended for MacOS, fonts look really bad.Some people have told me this monitor costs a little extra for the special colour calibration from the factory which is nice but shouldn't that be a factory standard for all monitors anyways?Power on-off + controls switch ( It's a joystick actually ) has a built-in white light which you can set to remain off or on. It serves as a keyboard light in dark rooms which I think is a brilliant idea!Speakers are just bad, so bad that they don't even deserve a review.2HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Line-in, 1 Headphone. Ports are alright but in horizontal position so if you plugin 2 cables side-by-size there is barely any space between them.Stand looks nice, cheap quality plastic again. Has a recycled kind of metal bar hidden underneath, attached for weight and stability. There is NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT and just a small amount of tilt. There is NO WOBBLE like everyone around here has been complaining, you guys need a sturdy table 😋Monitor comes with a control utility which you need to download from LG's website. It's okay and allows you use monitor in different modes. But I think 23.8 inch isn't that big enough for effective use of those features.Other brands with similar or even bigger size of monitors are much much  cheaper with same or better performance.Oh one major issue if you are hoping to use the VESA mount. The VESA screw ports are way up the monitor edge so if you mount it along side any other monitor this one will sit really low. I didn't realise is until after few months when I mounted it to a dual monitor setup with my existing Samsung display. Ugh! 🤦‍♂️"
5,"Does, what its supposed to do.All monitors are great, but 24"" 1080p with IPS panel, anti glare coating and inbuilt speakers for 15K, is a steal.Anti glare coating is a boon these days, see for yourself, there is a 18 W LED bulb glowing upfront of the monitor, still no issues, you won't be distracted by your own image or projections due to upfront light.This was a major issue, with my previous monitors.Also, I see, that prices have increased here on amazon, so do try local market in your area, if you're not getting a great deal on amazon."
5,This is one of the best investment I have ever made in a display. There are lots of reasons why I chose this display over any other display that is in its price range and some are even cheaper.- Color and Contrast is mind-blowing. While comparing it with my laptop screen you can clearly see the difference between the color grading.- The display is almost bezel-less and you will love to do photo editing as well as video playback on it. I do a very little gaming but despite the refresh rate being 60Hz I didn't notice any lag while the gaming.- I have lots of gadgets that connects via HDMI and I also have a home theatre system. The best part was that I was able to connect the monitor directly to sound system using the 3.5mm audio jack and I only have to connect HDMI cable for both audio and video.- The traditional VGA cable allows you to connect your old PC with ease.- I was amazed to download its windows software which allows the full monitor control right from the computer so that you won't ever have to touch the hardware buttons of the monitor.There are many other things that I love about this display but the above listed are the major ones.I have heard complaints that the stand of the monitor is wobbly and not so sturdy but I don't know why people are complaining about it. Because It's not like you are going to use it in your car or train. Once the monitor is placed on the table or wall mounted it won't matter if the stand is wobbly or not as long as you don't touch it.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and this couldn't get any better!
1,I ordered this monitor first time and I got screen with dead pixels. Placed replacement which I never got and had to cancel the order and place it again.This time it works perfect for 2 weeks and now I see full screen dead. White screen flashes and boom screen is gone.And now the return perioed is just 14 days and cant return/replace. Have to contact LG support and get it repaired on my own which is absolutely annoying and disappointing.
4,"Performed all the checks one is expected to do when you get one of these, all good. It's a 60hz monitor. It's not ideal for gaming only and only if you are that hardcore competitive gamer who wants everything before everyone(you wouldn't be looking for this if you are one of them) but for the rest 90%+ people who enjoy gaming and wants to have fun, this would do pretty good. I do play a lot of games and I haven't had any issues. 60hz is all you need tbh. Coming from a TN panel the difference is Day & Night both in terms of colour reproduction & viewing angle. This having an IPS will also help the folks with editing work. Why not 5 stars? The delivery. Absolutely horrendous. Delayed for 2 days. Had to write emails to get a proper communication about what's going on. The product itself is good. Sabr ka phal mitha wala logic probably."
5,"I have spent 3 days choosing this monitor which suits my requirements( work, movies & budget). I bought this monitor for ₹14800 received on 19th June 2020. I ordered it on 15th June 2020. It delivered well at my door step. It is beautifully designed with white/silver color. I have been using it daily 8-9 hours. The screen quality is really good. It has in-built speakers which are also good for a normal room(Study/Bedroom) not for big halls like Drawing/Dining room. You might face difficulty in listening in fan speed. But over all good speakers. It has 2 HDMI slots(To connect Laptop & Fire Stick(Yes, It supports fire stick), 1 VGA slot(To connect laptop/CPU), Audio In(Use monitor’s speakers via AUX cable), Audio out(To connect external speakers or Headphones) Slots. There is no USB slot and Bluetooth Feature.What’s in the box:1. It has Stand with screws for putting on table.2. One HDMI cable.3. One Adaptor for power.4. Manual book with CD and Warranty Card.Note: No VGA Cable."
1,I was looking for a bigger monitor after using a 22 inch dell monitor for 5 years. I was instantly disappointed with the ips panel on the LG monitor. It was bleeding all around the edges (not IPS glow). The monitor is a bad performer for its 27k price tag. My Dell is way superior. Returning this to go back to my Dell monitor. DO NOT buy this!
1,"Very disappointed with the purchase.I am a designer, and I was searching for a budget monitor for my requirements. I placed the order after lots of research.The first monitor I received was with heavy backlight bleed and one dead pixel on the bottom right corner. The black colour looked like dark grey, and also had a light blue shade on the centre of the monitor.Requested a replacement order, the replaced monitor is also defective. The monitor has a vertical black line. This line exists even not connecting to the computer.Total waste of my time."
3,"Not into gaming, so can't evaluate that aspect. I'm replacing a 10 year old Samsung SyncMaster SW2233 22"" Full-HD monitor which developed fungi like patches in screen.Since I've had no serious complaints about the old monitor that I had, I could only list down negatives about this first.- Last monitor I had was at perfect height for me (the top bezel should be at the height of our eye), this one shoots way higher. Both monitors had a fixed height, but this one is off the mark.- Last monitor sat on the table without any movement at all. This is a boat, simply shakes for any shakes in and around the table. This is the worst aspect of this monitor. I'm afraid I will topple this one day.- Last monitor had easily accessible dedicated switches for many controls on the side. This one being thin, has one joystick like power button-cum-menu navigation joystick at the bottom. It's quite intuitive to use, but due to the instability of the monitor, every movement of the joystick rocks the monitor all around.- Silver color actually is an eyesore. The black would have been perfect, and the thin border also would have become invisible.Now some positives to speak of+ There is lot of room at the bottom of the monitor due to it's elevated stand. I can keep some things and a tea cup beneath comfortably.+ I've had no audio / speaker system in my desk arrangement. This one's got audio over HDMI and it works well, loud and clear once you turn up the volume. Conference calls are very good. I've had a Kayasuda USB speakerphone but it's speaker output was way too weak. This compensates well for that shortcoming.+ The monitor overall dimensions are pretty much what I had earlier, but this being thin bezel, the screen area is indeed larger (Obviously the older one was 22"" and this is 24"")+ The On screen display fonts are bigger and legible compared to the older one. But once they are set to a preferred setting, you rarely change.+ This runs on a DC adapter, so the big fat power cord have given way for mobile like skinny charging cables.+ That power switch / joystick seems to light up the bottom of the monitor and hence the desk, so that may come handy at times.+ The ventilation slots are at the bottom, and very less compared to older monitor. So less areas for dust to go in"
1,Amazon delivered me damaged monitors twice and even lg is making poor quality monitors as the display has come of the bezels bcz of poor gluing.. lg is not maintaining any quality but gives quality assured papers in the box. That is soooooo stupid.
1,"Cons:Screen Bleeding at bottom side, it is expected in models with sleek bezel I guess.The bezel is actually distracting, silver plastic protruding off the black glass.(Go for black one)Stand is not attractive or durable as shown.Pros.Nice matte finish, still glossy is preferred for good colour reproduction.Speakers are good compared for their size, the bass and treble are amazing."
5,"I was looking for new monitor after my old Samsung monitor screen broke. I was not sure earlier whether to buy a monitor or tv. Since there were some TVs which were bigger in size and lesser in price i was confused whether to buy TV or monitor for my iMac. After some research i got to know that for maximum video and gaming performance monitor is better than TV. So i decided to buy monitor. Key feature that i was looking for were IPS display grater than my old monitor which was 21"", multiple HDMI port and in built speaker. This monitor matched all those expectations. It has great picture quality, which you can customize as per your needs(sports/gaming/movie). Multiple HDMI port means i no longer had to switch HDMI cable between my PC or Playstation. In built speaker are also surprisingly brilliant. Totally satisfied with this monitor. Thank you amazon for timely delivery."
1,"within 15 days from date of purchase this monitor started showing blur images.Straight white and black lines. and this is not at all ergonomic to use.Moreover, this is not at all good for movies, I had dell monitor as primary and brought it just because it has inbuilt speaker. But these speaker are not price either. total waste.Do yourself a favour by buying Dell ones, which can move up and down.======updateservice of lg is pathetic"
1,where bad product and amazon is rising prices of all products so dont go for amazon ...and this product is worst
3,Video Player is loading.
2,"I have used this product for the last two years. Not the best monitor out there, but it served my needs (the built in speaker is almost useless). However recently it failed to power on (I suspect the power block is the issue), and connected with LG Support from their website. Repeated call back requests were ignored and when I called them I was told that they will call back in 2 hours which also did not happen. Very poor servicing experience overall."
4,"I got this display to compliment my 2017 Macbook Pro.Pros:1. Beautiful Display Panel. Good Colours and nice black levels. Has a matte display so there is very little reflections.2. Very Futuristic, modern and sleek design with slim bezels3. Very neat  and modern looking OSD interface that has a single illuminated joystick to control it.4. LG software to control Brightness and Contrast settings directly from the laptop.Cons:1. The stand is a bit wobbly2. Speakers are good enough for computer sounds and light media use.  They can get loud no doubt but the sound quality and sound profile is not good for long use like watching movies."
5,I am using this for the WFH and watching Prime and YouTube. I don’t have a gaming PC or console so I don’t know how it will be working for gamers.1. easy to assemble and disassemble2. Good colour reproduction3. Good anti glare screen4. It has inbuilt speakers but not that good for listening. I have an external speaker so not using the monitor speaker5. 24” is more than enough for office work6. Thin bezels which looks premiumIt is not sturdy. Monitor will wobble if the desk moving slightlyIt doesn’t have height adjustmentThe tilt adjustment is a jokeThis screen can’t be rotatable like the Dell or any other PC monitor.What you will get is a very good panel with good colours reproduction for immersive feeling at this price point
5,"I was looking for work monitor which can be used as secondary TV unit as well.And this model of LG 24"" monitor fits that criteria.So my review is inclined more towards work+light usage. Not sure how good it is for heavy games.Pros:1. Excellent picture quality.2. Lots of options for connectivity. 2 HDMI, 1VGA, 1 Audio-in (used for mobile input, Bluetooth input), 1 Audio-Out (used to connect external speakers), Found it best in this range.3. Design is also slick and not much bulky.4. Bazel less gives cool look when operating on it.5. Compatible for generic VESA Wall Mount (Actually ideal for Wall Mount)6. 10W speakers are more than enough for my bedroom. We can change Bass, Treble, Balance. It also has nightmode (manually activated) in sound settings which keeps volume low.7. Multiple options for Pictures colour settings like Cinema, Sports, Games, ExtraBright, Reader modes and so on.8. Anti-Glare is important when working up-close to display and found useful.Cons:1. Wobbly stand. Base is made of Aluminium but its neck is all plastic, plus its connected with only one screw. altogether its weak in design as compared to weight of monitor. So even slight touch to table will wobble monitor :) (Hence said, ideal for Wall Mount)2. They gave lots of options for connectivity but missing is 1 usb port. I have to arrange extra for connecting my Chromecast to this monitor.3. Single button for all operations sounds cool but once its broken, you wont have any option for choosing inputs, sound adjustments and overall setting panal.4. Its heavy :) 3kg for today's technology is on higher side. could be due to speakers and all connections, but should have given sturdy stand as well.My plan.. when I am not using it as monitor, I will hang it on my wall and use as small TV!!"
3,If you are buying this product note this things :1. Don't buy 27 inch monitor because the pixels are structured and working with this monitor will be crispy because it supports only 1080p ...2. For 27 inch monitor you should go for 4K... Because for 27 inch the pixels will be stretched if you go fo 1080p3. The product specification is different venue product is received..... In product specification its shows that it support 75 Hz refresh rate but it supports only up to 60 Hz refresh rate.
5,"If you work long hours in computer and packing to buy monitor, just go for this one blindly. I'm using it for quite some time now,it's so comfortable that I don't even open my laptop. I work for long hours and surprisingly I don't feel eye irritation. Best part is it auto adjusts brightness which is very useful during night time. Also you've several modes to toggle between for display. All in all best one to own. I was initially placing for 27'' monitor but for home use 24'' inches is more than sufficient. After lot of research I bought this and I'm happy to own it.Only one Con is It's shaky. I'm ok with it with all other benefits I get and I don't shake my table or screen at all so there's no affect for me."
5,"I purchased this product recently and have used it for a few months now. I must say this is one of the best looking 4 side borderless monitors available (honestly, I couldn't find any other 4 side borderless monitors in the market). It looks premium in the desk and the anti-glare display is amazing. The picture quality is awesome and colour graded. So, I love using this to edit photos and videos without worrying about the colour quality. Anything that looks good in this monitor will look good in any other device. The blacks are deep and makes pictures look punchy. My product did not have any backlight bleeding issues, but you must understand that this is an IPS LCD panel and if you sit in a dark room, you will be able to see the backlight through the dark screen, however if it is evenly distributed throughout the panel then you don't have any bleeding. There are multiple picture modes available to adjust according to your use. The built-in speakers serves its purpose and are good for general use, don't expect it to sound like your home theatre...!! :P.Paired this up with my MacBook Air and loved it. The white glossy back adds more premium look to it.I am not a gamer and haven't used it for gaming. But I believe you wouldn't be buying this if you are really a gamer and know what refresh rate actually means!!!Also, 1080p on a 27 inch screen can actually make you see the pixels if you sit too close to the display, but it's not a big deal if you understand that it is a big screen and is meant to be used from a suitable distance for comfort. Similar 4k monitors from LG cost more and does not offer 4 side borderless panel. This is the only option to go if you really love to see a true borderless display.**It has a small black border running on 4 sides covered by a metallic/aluminum coloured frame. The border however doesn't protrude out  from the frame like the ones in normal monitors . It is coated inside the glass panel of the monitor itself. This gives the premium finish to the panel!! **HIGHLIGHT - There is no brand logo on the panel...!!!!!!! Awesome right? There is only a small LG logo at the right corner of the stand. LG definitely had given a lot of thought about making this look truly premium.LG is always a brand to trust when it comes to displays. So, I would recommend anyone with a budget to go for it without any second thoughts.!!!"
4,"It's quite expensive product, similar quality monitors can be purchased much lesser than this LG monitor (may be 5000 less), don't expect 4k video clarity, it's a FHD monitor, now a days most of the people are used to 4K video, however it's good to watch FHD/4k videos on high internet bandwidth.Pros:1) The build quality is good,2) Bazel design screen, no logo in front of the screen.3) Full HD and bright in color display.4) lot's of connectivity options, 2 HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Aux,Cons:1) Expensive2) Stand is not steady, but OK as long as table is stable, not to worry too much on this as many reviews gave negative feedback on stand.3) No return, only replacement in case any fault during 10 days of purchase"
1,The product has good picture clarity but the main drawback of this model is that the monitor stand is very weak and shaky. A slight jerk on the table cause the monitor to shake which is really disturbing. Even the jerk caused by typing on the keyboard cause the monitor to start wobble. I am really disappointed with this model.
4,"I should have bought this earlier, made the wfh easy on this rather than working on the laptop.The antiglare on this device is superb.This device has minor forward and backward tilt but the screen can't be rotated thats the drawback, but if coupled with a Rs1k monitor arm to remove that drawback instead of paying extra for a model which support the rotational feature.Picture quality is pretty good i must say, i played the 4k videos on youtube, it downgraded and played quite well, colors seem quite vibrant and saturated.When we unbox it, it looks very premium, since i have seen few devices worth 40k as well.I haven't played much games on it, so can't say much about gaming aspect.I bought this at Rs21k, i need to buy another device for home, but price is now a bot higher, hoping the price comes down in near future."
4,The monitor display is quite good. I liked the product as it is value for money with two HDMI ports. Overall it looks good and premium. Plastic back and the Stand is of very poor quality. So I have now purchased a Monitor arm and connected using VESA mount. Thankfully it supports VESA mount.
5,"Bought on 13th July, 2018.Excellent monitor.  The colors are amazing. The ghosting issue was a bit apparent and seemed troubling but it went away after i turned Response time to Low and Super resolution to OFF.Its close to bezel less so it looks sexy and if you have 2 size by side, its gonna be awesome.The curved stand is sexy and provides a housing unit for the wires at the back to ease off wire cluttering.It can also be wall mounted by buying a wall mount separately.My main reason to buy was its sleek look, Full HD support and VGA plus HDMI ports. No display port though so that's a neg. You can also attach your headphones to it via a 3.5mm jack at the back, but the sound quality is nothing to brag about, its decent.Overall, a total bang for your buck. Buy 2 with a good graphics card and game on."
3,"Had a very bad experience buying this monitor! 3 years since launch,so the technical advancement in this monitor wrt to picture quality is very bad.1.The display is not crisp, there is ghosting and pixelation issues with even  4k videos.2.Also, a big no for WFH as the text is not very clear.3.The only good thing about this monitor is the design of the panel but again the stand wobbles even with  a slight movement.4.Speakers are fine and support bass too!"
2,"Pros:  Picture quality is stunning u will love it,  Refresh rAte is excellently  Screen is very well calibrated  Works perfectly fine with MacBook Pro (2018)  Easy to setup  Good for gaming, played pubg and it worked fineCons:  Don’t purchase for speakers, they are not worth.anything, your phone has better speakers  You cannot do height adjustment  If table shakes a little while u move , the monitor wobbles like Noddy’s head  Got a straight line of dead pixels as u can see In attached image  Lack of USB ports sucks"
5,"For most of us who want to escape from the small displays of the laptop, this would the perfect treat for your eye. Again I'm not lobbying for this display and comparing with the 4K monitors out there, but for a 1080p this is surely a bang for the buck.If you keep this 3 feet away from your eyes, surely you wouldn't be able to notice the pixels and this 1080p does justice @ 92 ppi. Color reproduction is excellent and the sharpness of the images are good as well.Thus for a typical office use (MS Office, Email, Web Browsing, Basic content design/consumption) this is all you need. Hence go for this if you fall in the above cohort."
3,"Sweet spot for Full HD resolution monitorUpdate: After using it for 1 year and 6 months, I came to a conclusion that its not as good as I though it would be.I mean my 18.5 inch Dell Monitor of 1440x900 from 2008 or so gave me better quality than this even though being old and without any modes.The main concern that I have is Motion Glow or whatever, is it that you call, but I cannot view any video properly on 60 fps or above. It gives a strange motion blur /glow like ghosting along the path of the object in the direction in which the objects moves.I don't know if its my product that is like this or is every product like this and i haven't gotten used to it.Thinking about switching to 4k."
5,"Sturdy build quality.Anti-glare works perfect, I have a window behind my chair and still glare doesn't reflect on display even in bright day light.Has all configuration needed for audio, display(when connnected with multiple sources), etc. Joystick for menu and other adjustment of display is perfect.When i ordered this, I read in some reviews that it's not tilt adjustable, but the unit I got has tilt adjustment.Stand is very sturdy and display doesn't sack a bit.Cons are:Height is not adjustable.It doesn't come with USB C connection which would make it best considering a Macbook users which now comes with USB C only ports. So, you will need a USB-C to HDMI converor which I am using and works smooth without any issue so far."
5,"Excellent monitor SRGB colours are amazing for photo and video editing suits the best, and can play normal games.Most ppl complain speakers are awful, Guys its just small speaker housed in the monitor, don't expect home theatre sound. Speakers does pretty decent job.Go to menu choose Audio setting --> Maxx Audio settings -->  to be ONMax bass to be -3 -->MaxxDialog -2,Max Treble --> 3,Max3d -->3Change above settings it should sound pretty decent, or adjust sound settings as per your needs"
2,"Text appears worse than a cheaper monitor that I bought from Samsung.After buying this I have came to a conclusion that if you are looking for a monitor for coding or reading text only buy professional level monitors from HP or Dell. Text on this monitor is just not sharp enough, it has been siting in my store since bought as Amazon doesn't accept a return anyway."
4,"The monitor can solenly used for gaming, I was not satisfied with the picture quality and the brightness, if you are looking for a all round pc usage avoid this monitor, if need only to gaming this would be best for gamers out there"
4,"The product, overall, is a good one, barring the disappointing in-build speakers that come with the monitor. But, at a 10,700 rupees price point, 2HDMI ports and a 75hz screen is worth it. But, dont buy it if you need good in-build speakers...overall, satisfied for what I paid"
5,Best experience to use this product all settings best part that in this led 2 HDMI port there ... Value of money product
3,"I bought this monitor for the general purpose in September 2020. After using 20 days screen start fluctuating. I checked and found ports are loose. it has 2 HDMI port and both are loose.Color calibration is also not so good but brightness and contrast are overall good, You can buy for general purpose but for photo editing, it's not good because of no good color accurate."
4,If you see closely the pink strip at the bottom is just stuck over. Finishing is loose stand shakes and it look like they brought a display and attached AOC stickers over it.Performance is ok not a great display.I should have brought Dell :/
5,"The monitor loads pictures/graphics/videos etc. very fast. The 1080p resolution is very good. The colors are very bright and clear. I use it mainly for home and work. However, my neighbour kid has played games and seemed to like the monitor very much."
1,The monitor got a stuck pixel in just 2 weeks . Very Bad. Now addition i also have a line at the bottom
5,This monitor is really good. I'm using this to extend my laptop display using VGA port. It's HDMI port is also working fine when we connect through TV tuner. Its colouring and brighness features need to be set when you seat very close because it is kind of gaming monitor so sharpness can impact your eyes. Overall I find it is very good.
2,Pro :Screen size is bigCons :Build quality is not good (I could see gap between the display and the borders )Overbrightness ( Even after Reducing brightness to zero  )Not suitable for general useAll colours appear a little dull
5,Monitor is really good specially for gaming the colors r very good and vibrant the screen size is 25 inch which also point at this price point so I will recommand to go with monitor
5,Sound / volume is not great
5,Very good product. value for money
5,This is good monitor. But picture quality is not so good  since its a TN panel. Other than that everything is so good.
1,Product with infected. VGA port with issue they deliverd
5,"quick delivery, good price, good quality.. i got just what i wanted...Happy that i selected AOC instead of Samsung."
5,"Best and cheap gaming monitor, inbuilt speakers are not upto their standards other than that its worth it"
3,Its build quality feels so cheap/
5,Value for money. Good performance
5,It's very good product
5,AOC monitor good collect the waste.
1,"10% off on ICICI Debit EMI transaction never worked for me. Though, I had the eligibility and balance (bank confirmed that) the offer never worked. Amazon customer support is of no help on this too.Advise to Amazon: Either solve customer's issue or document resolution mechanism for such issues clearly. This is frustrating and time consuming for customers."
5,"Hd smoothThis is an edit that I am doing after using this product for 16 monthsIts HD smooth. its legit 1ms response helps u to take down ur enemies , give them no time to react , sounds badass right go ahead buy it and experience (sighs, buying this  monitor with 1ms response rate edit:get anything above 144hz dont go under it if into gaming unless u wanna rage quit XD"
5,G2590VXQ gaming monitor is power packed with AMD Free Sync Technology which synchronizes GPU with the monitor without stuttering the image display. Its Flicker Free Technology and true to life game color give you the most detailed gaming experience. G2590VXQ also comes with an extremely low input lag and a response time of just 1 ms.
1,Do not buy. Looting customers. Actual price is 22999. Plus there's is wireless earphones free offer. So ultimately the monitor costs 20k.Wait for the price to drop to 22k. Useless.Ban these type of sellers
1,Bought it from Kora solutions but received a defective product. Now from last 2 days following up on replacement request and seller says they can max repair the product but cannot replace or return it.I did raised this complaint with Amazon for replacement or refund. But Amazon said that they are just a courier service and work as a broker between seller and customer. If there is any issue with product they cannot help. Customer need to do whatever seller recommend. If seller says they cannot help then Amazon cannot do anything. These were the exact words mentioned by Raj N from Amazon leadership team.After multiple frustrating follow up with Samsung and seller I got money refunded.Thanks Seller for helping me with the refund
5,"Samsung Odyssey G7 is a great monitor for both gaming and watching movies and tv series.PROS: 👍1. 240hz2. 1440p resolution3. Gsync compatible4. VA panel (deep blacks are great)5. curved monitor, so you don't have to turn your head too much while sitting close. (no it doesn't feel too curved just right at the point)6. core lighting, puts less stress on your eyes in dark.7. the pixel density is about 109 PPI so it's obvious the text clarity will be good as well8. comes with two 3.0 USB slots, so you can plug your mouse and keyboard.9. It comes with HDR 600. movies, games, and series look great watching on HDR.CONS: 😌1. gets hot easily when HDR is on, you can feel the heat on your face, but having an ac room should fix that issue.2. THE PORTS ARE A NIGHTMARE TO REACH !! they are so hard to access, if you don't have a big table you'll struggle to find ports just by the feel of hands. what makes it super hard is they are not visible from the back or can be felt with a hand easily.3. Just HDR 600, HDR 600 isn't great but better than the fake HDR 400 certified monitors.4. core lighting isn't bright enough with half of the available colors so make sure to choose the bright color.5. most importantly, the stand is huge which might not an issue for big tables. i suggest a gas-powered VESA mount.6. Vulcan and HDR aren't compatible for some reason, your monitor will go blank and won't start without replugging the power cord.EXTRA: no dead pixel or any sort of faults in my unit, Bought it for 43500rs"
1,Grainy pictures and crushed blacks in dark scenes in movies or youtube videos.Good for gaming
3,"This monitor has the following issue (firmware 1011.0):When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is ON - Micro-stuttering in games when slow camera panning - like when you use a gamepad or controller to pan the scenery. This micro-stuttering is not present if ""VRR Control"" is switched OFF.When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is OFF - If frame rates go above 90 fps, then there is a lot of inverse ghosting. Cannot correct this inverse ghosting as ""Response Time"" is disabled during ""Adaptive Sync"" ON. Another issue is that even if you play 60 fps games, LFC engages at 72 fps, so a 60 fps game is actually running at 120 fps on the monitor which is in the ""inverse ghosting"" region. You can bring down the LFC lower boundary to 30 fps by CRU (see some reddit posts), so that 60 fps games do not get overshoot. But mind you at such low fps without LFC flickering issue can be seen."
5,The beast of all the Gaming monitors. You would fall in love with it and never want to go back to flat screens. The only competition it has is its G9 model which is way too expensive.G7 is the best thing you would love from your gaming rig and can fully utilize all the newest GPUs with this.It is a bit heavy but worth every penny.Kudos to SAMSUNG for this fantastic product.
5,"I use it an my daily driver for gaming, watching movies and create graphics design. The curve gives you a pretty good end to end viewing angle that makes you feel the display is all around you.Though it's price is high compared to other monitors available in the market, I'm satisfied with this product."
5,"Background:I have a decent gaming rig (RTX 3070) and was using a LG 32GK650F 32"" 1440p 144Hz VA panel with my setup. I mostly play FPS (CS, Valorant) but also occasionally play RTS (AOE2), AAA titles and consume a decent amount of video and browsing content as well. The main reasons for upgrading were: low pixel density of LG monitor (webpages and text looked awful), black smearing (I mostly use black backgrounds and boy the smearing was bad) and maybe size (found 32"" to be slightly big for FPS games).Other considerations:Considered many alternatives varying from 27"" 1440p to 32"" 4K monitors. Most of the 27"" 1440p monitors were limited to 144/165Hz and while it was not a deal breaker but it was inferior to 240 Hz anyways. I would have gone for 4K 144Hz monitors but then my RTX 3070 wouldn't be enough for 4K gaming. 280Hz/360Hz 1080p monitors were out of question because I don't play competitively at that level. HDR at this price range is just a marketing gimmick. You need atleast a 1000 nits panel with multiple local dimming arrays for a decent HDR experience. IMO HDR is mostly suited to OLED panels.IPS vs VA:Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 have the best VA panels in the world and are the fastest VA in the market beating even the top IPS panels. I mostly use black backgrounds and play in dark so VA were obviously a better choice with high contrast ratio and no IPS glow. The only thing that was bothering me was black smearing which luckily Samsung has done such a good job that it's on par with IPS panels. IPS do have better viewing angles but then again it wouldn't matter if it was a curved display in the first place. I don't share my screen so curved and slightly less viewing angles were ok with me.What's great:I got a decent panel with minimal backlight bleed, no dead pixels, no black smearing. Colours are far better than my previous LG monitor. Contrast and colours are great. Display is sharp and crisp and gets bright enough to use it in a well lit room. Out of the box display calibration was decent. Games look beatiful. The curve is aggressive and took me around a day to get used to and now I love it. I can keep the monitor close and focus on the center of screen (in FPS games) and still have field of vision in the corners. I use it on a DP 1.4 cable at 1440p 240Hz 10 bit (8bit+FRC).What's not so great:Size. The monitor is thick and the curve is to blame here. Make sure you have enough space on your desk. Secondly, the stand is just huge. It is very stable and offers every kind of adjustment but for a 27"" panel it is just plain huge. I use a monitor arm so that isn't an issue for me but it's something to keep in mind. Pricing is a hit or miss. Look for price cuts during sales. But comparing to other brands this is decently priced. Other brands like LG, Asus, Gigabyte has a huge difference in offshore and Indian pricing which I just consider plain cheating and greediness.Conclusion and recommendations: It's a great all rounder monitor albeit for a selected audience. It is highly recommended for someone who wants the best of both worlds (FPS+AAA gaming), prefers to use the monitor in the dark, isn't bothered by the curve, has enough space on desk or a monitor arm. Consumers who play eSports competetively should look for 1080p 280/360Hz monitors. And those who play on consoles or AAA games only should eye a 4K 144/120Hz display or OLED displays (especially for HDR). IPS panels for those who wants wider viewing angles and share screen and are not bothered by IPS glow and low contrast ratio. This is all from a gamer's perspective only as I don't use any productivity applications. Hope this helped you!"
5,"Everything i expected from this monitor, i got. I was skeptical at first since people mention flickering/stuttering issues, but my unit did not have those issues. 1440p 240hz at 10 bit color works fine with the included displayport cable since my 2070S has DP1.4 DSC support. No visible ghosting/smearing (regular or black level) and overshoot. HDR is pretty good with the max brightness of 600 nits and around 90% dcip3 and an upgrade over SDR (although not as good as my Galaxy Note 9, which is a self emissive display with 1000+ nits peak brightness and a wider color gamut).My only complaint is the VRR range of the monitor. Nvidia lists this monitor's range as 60 to 240hz, yet LFC seems to trigger as early as 90hz. If a game stays above or below 90fps, it's a non issue; but if a game moves constantly above and below 90fps, it's gonna be distracting since there's some stutter before the monitor moves in and out of LFC (This is evident for me when playing Doom eternal maxed out with rtx on). Not sure if this is from the monitor's side or nvidia's implementation of LFC on Freesync monitors."
1,Worst picture qualityPlease refrain from buying this monitor
5,I bought the 27’ monitor for my Xbox series X and it’s freaking amazing. Better performance than any other monitors that I used before for FPS shooter games . Great color and TN like low input performance. If you have the money just go for it . 100 % Future proofed.

5,"Very good product for gaming mashine.we are happy to buy this product.good performance in gaming sagment.Nice resolution,nice picture quality"
5,Buy 2 of these and enjoy. Only con it is not 4k monitor but their is no regret in purchasing it.
1,"I'm the first buyer of this product.The one that I received was defective. It had a pale red patch in the top center of the screen. Image attached. Currently returning this one for a replacement. Will update as the replacement arrives.Things you should know before buying this product:1. It is a Gsync compatible only monitor, not a Gsync ultimate one. This means there is no Gsync module inside. It is just an Nvidia version of Freesync.2. The one I received had little to no backlight bleeding, but there was huge amount of IPS glow and it was awful. Rtings.com also says that this monitor has such high amounts of IPS glow. The backlight bleeding varies from unit to unit.3. Poor viewing angles - The viewing angles on this monitor is like that of a TN panel. This is because of the strong IPS glow. Rtings.com also found the same.4. Vignetting effect - The horrendous amount of IPS glow creates a vignetting effect. Pixels farther away from the screen appears dim.5. Non-uniform brightness - The brightness is not uniform everywhere on the screen. This is also related to the vignetting effect.6. There were two dead pixels that I could find. Being a 4k display, they were far too small to cause any nuisance.There were no issues of flickering, or vertical banding or sleep-to-wake problem, or dust particles being stuck beneath the screen.Some good things about the monitor:1. The colors are terrific. I haven't seen such beautiful reds. They are like blood.2. If you are a programmer, then dark modes look beautiful on this one (and in general on all IPS monitors). Dark mode is typically bad on VA monitors because of the high contrast ratio of VA panels that makes the text look like floating on ink. On IPS panels, dark backgrounds look like they are moonlight, if you understand what I mean. On VA panels, the background is like deep ink. IMO, the moonlight is more easy on the eyes.Overall this is the cheapest 4k144Hz monitor. I don't think you will find anything better than this up until the X27. If it were not for the red patch in the center of the screen, I would have kept it.Also, I couldn't comment on the fluidity of the panel, since my GPU does not support 144Hz output. I have purchased a new GPU which will take a few days to arrive. I'll update this review after that. Also, I'll update on my findings with the replacement unit.Update:--~~~~~~~~This is incredibly shameful. I wrote 10+ emails, called Amazon customer care 10+ times, and even today I spoke with a senior customer care executive who escalated the matter. But still the return pickup guy did not come to pick up the aforementioned items.Currently, I am waiting on my 11th day since I started the return process."
5,"Based on an IPS panel by Innolux, which is also used in the Gigabyte Aorus AD27QD , the Acer XV272U monitor supports 10-bit color via dithering (8-bit + 2-bit FRC) and covers 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut (~130% sRGB). For 10-bit color, you will have to limit the refresh rate to 120Hz. Gsync working without any issues with RTX 2070 over a DP cable even though this is not certified compatible. HDR is a gimmick but nice to have. You cannot use both FreeSync and HDR at the same time.There are three response time overdrive presets (Off, Normal, and Extreme). You cannot use ‘Extreme’ and VRR (FreeSync) simultaneously.At 144Hz, the Acer XV272U input lag amounts to only ~4ms when you enable the Ultra-Low Latency option in the OSD. There are no issues when it comes to the performance; no excessive IPS glow, backlight bleeding, or dead/stuck pixels.If you don’t need HDR nor DCI-P3 color gamut, there is more affordable 27″ 1440p 144Hz IPS models such as the Acer Nitro VG271UP without the stand adjustment.  HDMI cable is included in the box. DP cable needs to be purchased separately."
3,"Hello friends,  there is no much reviews available for acer xv270p , so i wud like share experience.If you are a person looking for high quality display for colors like professional and evrything then this monitor is not for you.If u are a person looking for budget monitor with decent specs-  then Yes. ButBudget IPS panels have weird issues.I got the first monitor,  which had dead subpixels. Rest all was good no back light bleed or anything.The seller was kind to replace and amazon for  helping. It was a good experience to shop from seller and amazon as they acknowledged the issue and helped meSo i got the replacementBut the replacement product had back light bleeding and it had a power cord thats not suitable for the room sockets, you cannot plug in, u need a socket ment for heavy appliances like AC ,Oven and all.So i was surprised,  the previous one had dead pixel and very raerly a discolouration vertical line, rest everything was perfect, the cord size and all.Second one had black light bleed and incompatible power cord socket which make it unusable,  using that cord nd shoving it into ur monitor with higher input volt , specially in india where voltage fluctuate. Also u can't put into UPS sockets.I did not understand  Why ! , same product and so much different with accessories. i couldn't unnotice the huge manufacturing differences and came to conclusion that the replacement is a defective product and the first one too.I still wanted the same model as its good monitor if u get everything right, but i couldn't get replacement again, so ended up returning.Huge thanks to amazon and support. Because seeing the other reviews i thought i  wud lose money , i was fortunate to get things done.I also had video backup of unboxing process so no one points in later stage.Conclusion: all the monitors in this price range have one or the other issue,  some face it soon, some later. And also u can b lucky to not face any issues at all.So because amazon service is good, i wud definitely say, u can buy the monitor chances of getting good one is more. Dont get confused with reviews.If u feel u wont get replacement or return then dont buy.Welcome to the world of cheap IPS panels, where i feel manufacturers are just pushing new models as competition rather than making sure about quality and reliability.  what i feel abt manufacturers in 2020.Usability : if u are not going to keep like minimum 1feet distance from monitor then u wud propably notice the pixels clearly in Full HD 27inch monitors. Some of u may not like this. They can opt for 24inch as it has higher DPI.Also the MRP price was less than what its shown and make u feel getting huge discounts.Feedback to manufacturer: i would like to say, this monitor has potential to grow in market,  the quality needs to be improved and make the screen reliable for heavy use in long run.  This could be the only reason if this model fails in long run.Also please update the accurate product description in acer india website , i did not find the model itself. Which was stressful as cannot depend on just amazon description which is not complete.I tried reaching to Acer customer support,  trust me , i couldn't go further from IVR response . Difficult to reach for any enquiry and service. Please resolve the issue.Feedback to amazon: i returned the product with top notch conditions,  but the pick up person to verify the product, handles badly due to hurrying up the process, i was like doing that way will definitely screw up product in process.Products like this that has display and these days bezel less,  needs more care during handling."
1,"Ordered 2 gaming monitors from Amazon. One was delivered on 28th April and another on 30th April. When i tried to set up the monitors, realized that one of the monitors was shipped with a 16A power plug which doesn't fit into any of my sockets. Immediately i ordered new cables from Amazon which were delivered the next day.Once the monitors were set up, I immediately realized one of the monitor's brightness was completely different. It was like the blue light filter was by default ON. Upon checking all settings were exactly the same. Swapping, different HDMI cables nothing worked.  I reached out to Acer support in this regard on 2nd May. After some basic troubleshooting, they determined that a service engineer would visit for further troubleshooting. However, no one came nor called to date.Later I called Amazon customer service and a hand-to-hand replacement was arranged.The replacement product was received on 8th May'21. Bummer this one has the same exact issue. Upon investigating both monitor packages. I realized that the good monitor was manufactured in Jul'20. The other 2 (Replaced & Replacement) monitors were manufactured in Nov'20.Again called Amazon customer service, spoke to multiple people. Everyone seems to echo the same scripted resolution. They can only issue a refund for the replacement monitor and not the entire order. I need a Dual monitor for my work. How can I use 2 monitors with different color and brightness levels? Can't Amazon support NOT understand such a simple thing. Also was I repeatedly being advised to place a new order with no guarantees from Amazon customer service that I wouldn't Nov'20 batch monitor. After much argument, a Manager call has been arranged in 48 hrs. Let's see what that person has to say.@AMAZON Support:I DON'T NEED A REFUND. Just REPLACE it with a Ju1'20 manufactured product or REPLACE the Jul'20 product with NOV'20 manufactured product. I am ok with either one of the resolutions.@ACER:What kind of quality control do you have? Also, your support is equally PATHETIC."
5,"Bought this monitor after searching long and hard for a proper upgrade to my aging 1080p 23inch AOC monitor. Needed something for gaming, consuming content with vivid and accurate colours and big enough to immerse me in it completely. Found this to be the perfect fit, albeit in the pricier range, and with 144hz feature that isn't of much use for me in the immediate future, but worth it in the long run.The colours on this monitor is absolutely gorgeous. It comes colour calibrated, along with a document showing the details of the calibration. The brightness is more than enough to force me to turn it down to 20-30% for normal web use. The I/O is great, with support for DP 1.4. The HDR is decent, as one would expect for HDR 400 certified monitor.  As for the backlight bleeding mentioned in other reviews, I haven't really found it to be that distracting or overpowering.  The bezels are small on 3 sides, allows for the 27inch screen to stand out. Something that isn't clear in the pictures given on the site is the amazing stand it comes with that allows for 90 degrees rotation (maybe 360 degrees too, haven't tried) of the monitor, a decent amount of height adjustment, as well as a solid base that allows for easy swiveling of the monitor, all welcome additions.However, do note that the packaging it came in was damaged for me. Seems like an amazon issue rather than the seller as others have had a much better experience. The box had multiple cuts, deep ones, but thankfully, the monitor inside seems undamaged.There was an issue with the transaction in my case, but the seller xtronicsapp was very helpful in communicating with me and promptly solving that issue with no hassle at all. Something I didn't expect from any seller on this site, so 5 stars to xtronicsapp. Go for this monitor if you have the money, and go for the seller for a great customer service given in case any issue should arise."
1,"Seeing the positive reviews i bought one recently and the monitor had a color temperature issue, the top half of the monitor is cooler and bottom half is warmer, no amount of tinkering with the color temperature settings can solve this issue but had no backlight bleeding. I decided to get a replacement because its very noticeable on a white background or light color background. The second monitor has huge backlight bleeding on the right side and the same color temperature issue. I am done with Acer monitors, last year i tried VG271UP which had bleeding from everywhere but no temperature issue. At this point i have returned 3 monitors in a span of 4 months. The quality control for these IPS displays are horrible. I cant spend 25k+ and live with a defective monitor. Time to move on to a different company and pray that i receive a good monitor. Thanks to amazon's quick refund/replacement policy during situations like these."
5,This monitor is way better choose then Acer Nitro VG271U . It has a great brightness and supports HDR. It's height adjustable. The quality is perfect with even support for 1 MS delay . If you are gamer but also enjoy multimedia better go for this then the TN pannel. You will enjoy it better.
3,The monitor is bright and colourful besides the edge glow and too much backlight bleeding which is common among most acer monitors. It’s actually on luck and there are possibilities that your display has less bleeding while I was very unlucky that my monitor had excessive bleeding so I returned it back. Seller quickly accepted the returned and my money was refunded in 4 working days. Now I have order a BenQ monitor ex2780q which had better review than this monitor. Choosing a monitor for gaming is tough decision so I would suggest you to do R&D On display types on YouTube. I spent 4 days to finally go for BenQ. Wish me luck on its arrival. Hoping for good results
5,"After completing close to one month research for a dual-purpose Monitor, I choose this Acer product, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. Price, features and Technology are in perfect balance. Important information regarding USB usage, there is one cable provided by Acer with this product which needs to be connected to the computer, to enable USB on the monitor. Without this cable, only charging will happen and no other device will work. G-Sync works very well on this monitor( I am using GTX 1660 ti ).Highly impressed with 2K resolution, HDR and 144hz refresh features. With 30k budget, I couldn't find a better product than this comparing with LG, BenQ which are charging 5k extra for similar functions."
5,"FYI for Indian buyers: This monitor comes with a 15A cable instead of a regular 5A one. You may not have 15A outlets in your room, so if you're getting this monitor, make sure you have an extra 3-PIN POWER CABLE (for desktops and monitors, NOT laptop 3-pin power cable) that's rated for 5A. Acer has approved 5A cables to be used with this, and I'm using one with no issues.Now, for the actual review. This monitor is excellent. It has deep black levels, and the colour contrast is fantastic. However, brightness settings are weird because the lowest setting is way too high.I'll admit, 144Hz is not the kind of revolutionary upgrade I'd expected it to be, but it definitely makes first-person games look and feel much better to play.Speakers kinda suck, so definitely use headphones or get external speakers. Height adjustment is definitely a plus, and the monitor and stand both feel quite sturdy.Granted, I've only had it for a short while now, but I'm really liking it so far."
3,"Cons1) my eyes hurt like crazy after using it for like 30 minutes maximum brightness is all good but the minimum brightness of this monitor is similar to about 80% brightness of my macbook (2017 13 inch). Unfortunately I'll have yo return this for this single reason.2) other reviews said that there was very less issue of backlight bleeding but you can see the pictures for yourself3) if you're coming from something like a macbook you'll immediately notice that the texts are not as sharp this is because of less ppi. If you're not a gamer I'd suggest you to go for a 4k monitor with less refresh rate.4) it says on details and features section that you can rotate 90 you can but the stand it comes with will get in your wayPros1) as far as i can tell colors are better on this monitor compared to my macbook (note: just my personal experience not an expert)2) it's one thing to imagine how big it'll be but mannn this this is huge.3) 144hz: i plugged my mac and started using it didn't notice anything, but as soon as i went back on my mac screen bro i was like where's the smoothness did my mac break so something is it lagging? You can feel while scrolling4) brightness if you like it it gets crazy bright5) good stand other from not rotating 90 degree"
3,I have used two high performance 2k monitors in past acer xb271hu and benq ex2780q.This is the xb273k gp version and doesnt match to all the xb273k reviews you’d find.This monitor has great response times cant measure but feels way better than the above two mentioned great colors and no issues with gsync.Perfect for gaming.But this has a pretty weird issue in light backgrounds everything’s good but in dark (games like metro exodus) you’ll have to move your head around becomes pretty annoying at first I thought it to be bad ips glow but comparing to benq seems like it has on par or less glow(with blue led is this one) but I don’t understand whats the issue is either its the coating applied or something else but  I am going to keep this as this is otherwise a great 4k gaming monitor.But there’s this weird greyish hue on the bottom two corners and its pretty evident.
5,The box looked a little worn. but when opened and installed i got a pretty good panel little to no backlight bleed and the IPS glow is also pretty less HDR 400 is very less but i use my pc in a dim lighted room so 400nits is enough so far. Amazing for gaming. would not recommend overclocking to 144hz on 4k as there is not much difference from 120Hz to 144Hz. but you will have to use 2 display ports to achieve that at the cost for color accuracy.. Will update in a few weeks are testing it on RTX 3080
5,"Update after 1 Year.This is a great monitor, I dont even see the backlight bleed anymore in the replaced unit. I've been using it each day for 8-10 hours without any issues.The stand is a little wobbly, but no major issues.Will buy another one to complement it and build my multi monitor system further.----------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE after 20 days - Backlight bleed is visible in dark backgrounds, attaching for reference, will be replacing this from the brand and will update here after that. Apart from the the monitor is great.----------------------------------------------------------------------Fantastic value for money monitor.This high quality 2k 144hz ips panel  with superb calibration is unparalled in IndiaThe stand is great too. But if you are planning to get a vesa mount , then the vg271u would be cheaper option with same panel.Negligible blb, ips glow isn't visible to naked eye and no dead/stuck pixels.------------------------------------------------"
5,"Summary/TL;DR: Buy if you care about high refresh rate, adequate resolution, and color accuracy.  If you only care about two out of these 3, there are other better monitors for your use cases.Pros:1. Fantastic color accuracy. I am an amateur photographer and work extensively on a macbook pro 15. That screen sets the reference for me. The had a Dell 24 inch monitor earlier (which was no match to the macbook). The acer is indistinguishable to my eyes from the macbook in terms of color unless you look very deeply2. Resolution: There are a ton of 4K monitors for the price with similar color accuracy. There are also a ton of 1080p 240hz monitors for the price. Depending on your specific use cases those might be better. But I find 1440p perfect for me as most upper mid-range GPUs (<Rs. 20K) are perfectly capable of using the resolution and the 144hz refresh rate too.3. Refresh rate: Just like resolution, I think 144hz is the sweet spot for refresh rate. Everything from just browsing to gaming feels great. Anything higher is difficult to practically achieve with affordable graphics cards and IMO harder to distinguish too (I honestly can't make out 240Hz from 144Hz unless looking for it). The response times could be better but not bad by any meansCons:1. Uneven brightness: On a pure black screen with the monitor on, in a dark room, you can see the backlight is quite uneven. This does not happen on my macbook. But upon digging through Reddit and other forums, I gathered that this is common with budget monitors. And it is not noticable in general use cases. But it's definitely average in this regard.2. HDR: This is just a feature thrown in for marketing. There is no advantage to having HDR on or off and in a lot of cases, it's probably better off. HDR 400 ~= no HDR. If you need great HDR, HDR 600 is where you start seeing a little difference and HDR 1000 is where it's obvious. Don't buy monitors for HDR when they say it's HDR 400."
5,"Before this I have used two LG monitors - 27GL650F and 27UK650.Problem with full HD 27GL650F was up close the text and image look pixelated and because of it display didn't look smooth. Made me realize full HD may not look the best on a 27"" display. The 4k 27UK650 was sharp, clear and so smooth even at half a feet. Couldn't make out even a single pixel but practically didn't find it worth it. Good for Videos, but not appropriate for development work since most normal people don't consume content in 4k and my GC (3060ti) was struggling to get over 60 fps at high settings.Anyway, I read all the reviews and did my own research. Not pros and cons but rather few facts I observed about this monitor  -- QHD seem perfect resolution for 27"". Can't make out the pixels in text and display is so smooth. Sits just below 4k display clarity- Colors are vibrant, seem accurate and pop out. Much better than display of 27GL650F and very close to 27UK650- Menu navigation is simple and easy- 4 USB ports helps a lot. Didn't notice any delays when connecting keyboard and mouse to it.- Speaker is decent and better than having none like on 27GL650F and 27UK650- SDR Brightness is less, even at peak brightness it is no where near the level of both LG's. HDR brightness is just average. But this was fine for me. People who like or need too bright display may have to reconsider. If at night time I had to reduce brightness of LG's to 25-30% then for this monitor its 60% so you can get an Idea. Still looks fine under outside light in daytime, matte screen helps too.- HDR seems useless at least in gaming. Colors were washed out and dull in far cry 5 so had to turn it off. Consider HDR 400 as a specification on paper.- Better ergonomics. The way stand is designed and works makes it so easy to handle (definitely better than LG's)- bezels are so slim that display sometime feel like small for a 27"". Not so flat from back side.- Played few games, response time seem good- The first and biggest inconvenience you will notice will be the power cable, Not sure why they included a bigger 16amp plug. Have to buy a 16 amp to 6 amp converter or a new power cable. So that maybe extra INR 300 investment to make it work.- The original power cable is 1.8 meter and power adapter is inbuilt, so that's quite good and less clutter.- Didn't find any dead pixel and it had usual IPS glow, nothing out of the ordinary. If I don't feel the light bleed under normal usage I don't go crazy over the bright corners under black display and taking snap from phone make it look much worse then it actually is.- Import month was Jul 2021.- Ports are a bit underneath so takes some effort. But looks clean from back side. Two usb port on sides are very convenient. Got only HDMI cable in box.- Build quality is good, specially the stand. Very easy to setup.So, Overall I would say a very good candidate for QHD 144hz display in this price range. I really liked it for its color and vibrant display, ergonomics, usb hub feature, Inbuilt adapter & speaker, slim bezels. Watch out for brightness and the power cable. Don't take it seriously for HDR usage."

5,"Edit on product review....🥸1st one was bought from ( GROW MORE DEALS) Thought, worst buy of all as packaging was tempered if i compare with my re-buy from (Appario Limited).(Grow More Deals) Acer predator xb273k box was total sealed with foam wrap on box but monitor was defective inside. There was no sealing tape on box and box had dust on it and i mean real dust as taken out after years... Took me a week to get the product and another week to send by my side, even  paying shipping fee from my side, they even took 10% out from refund for Restock.. WTFun(Appario Limited) Acer predator xb273k monitor came in 2 days time with no extra packaging but box had seal tape of acer. I was afraid of getting another something bad one... But to my surprise the monitor was bang good, everything is great working with no issue.Difference...Well 1st buy was 8k lower in price so i can say they might selling refurbished (GMD) 🤣..Then the box wasn't sealed on 1st buy... And with extra dust as bonus😅Next thing i saw was instructions manual was in open packet in 1st box whereas in re-buy it was in sealed pack even the charging cable was in seperate packs not together as was in 1st buy😒Many coverings on monitor legs were missing and face cover was torn from middle in 1st buy when compared to re-buy😞Lastly was extra protection as monitor neck foam, termacol base in box for monitor stand, and plastic covers on both side of box hand grips were all missing in 1st buy.. ConclusionNo More Grow More Deals... 😵But 5 star on buy from Appario.. Satisfied with product"
5,"This monitor maintains the perfect balance between gaming performance and content creation. With VBR enabled it provides 1ms response time. Also has 10-bit colour depth, vhich is really usefull for better video quality. Also, as it is factory calibrated the colours are straight up perfect out of the box. However the downside is the downside (only for pure gaming performance) is that, because it has IPS panel ( which is actually great for content creation) it sometimes has slow response time and also shadowing. Overall it is the perfect mid range 1440p 144hz monitor. And also one should know that HDR400 really does not make much of a difference at 250nits brightness, HDR really shines at 1000nits+. However this panel is G-SYNC compatible(not certified), which means no screen tearing.But, in the end the 1440p 144hz IPS panel gives, sharpness, speed and quality all at a justified price."
1,"At this price, it's probably only Acer who's giving these specifications (1440p, 144Hz). And I guess the way they're able to do this is thanks to abysmal quality control.I initially received the original unit, which had at least 10 dead pixels. Immediately asked for a replacement, and the Amazon tech specialist was happy to oblige after checking the pictures.Received the replacement unit after almost 5 days, and that also had the same issue. At this point, I was so furious with Acer that I just initiated a return pickup and placed the order for an LG Ultragear 27GL850.It could just be my luck, or it could be that the seller was trying to push out defective units somehow. Either way, this has wiped all trust I had in Acer products."
5,"Seller: XtronicsappPanel has 0 defects, Backlight bleed is negligible and no dead pixels on arrival. Has a height adjustable stand that is sturdy (I am not using a mount so can confirm), colors are crisp af!"
2,"I wish I had seen Polarstar's review( 9th May )  before buying this monitor because while the product reviews had it bright and vibrant, what I got was a very yellow-tinted, very low-brightness monitor.Searching around the internet, it seems to be a widespread issue for recent buyers. It's especially noticeable to people who had already bought this monitor before late 2020 and then bought one recently. Mine was manufactured in Nov. 2020.Apparently, Acer have changed the panel on this model and while the new panel looks to be better for gaming(faster pixel response times), the picture quality is very different with very low brightness and whites being yellow and blacks looking slightly greenish.I have it alongside LG's nanoIPS 27GL850 which costs substantially more than this monitor because it had the best pixel response times for an IPS monitor. The Acer monitor seems to keep up with the LG when it comes to fast-paced FPS games, but the picture quality looks absolutely dismal in comparison. Bright day on LG looks like overcast on Acer, and that's before you notice the strange colors due to the yellow-tint on it.I'd suggest to keep away from this monitor if you want the monitor that originally came out a couple of years before and was reviewed as such."
5,"Upgrading from 24inch 1080p to 27inch 1440p feels huge. Great display with good colors. A great IPS gaming display under 25k but i got it in 21k which is superb for 2k 144hz ips monitor. One thing i notice that in SDR mode the display brightness not looks that high. Its little lower then my old lg 24mp88 monitor. But in HDR mode you get good brightness  and colors feels amazing. One minor issue i notice the display gets pretty warm near the acer branding, i think their is very little gap between internal power supply and display. Manufacturer should fix this one issue. Thanks."
3,"Received the product with no USB ports!!The ports were empty i.e. the manufacturers forgot to put the usb ports.M happy as I got a replacement but it was 4 days late as per scheduled day.Product is great.ISSUES:- When in dark , LCD light bleeding occures, can't complain as LCD with thin bezels have this issue predominantly.- Brightness can't be much reduced... At night the lowest brightness feels like it's at 50% brightness... for this issue What I do is I turn on the reading mode with lowest brightness this kind of solves the issue of brightness at Night.- Made in ChinaGreat product overall for this price."
2,The product is good but I had to pay 24k and now in just 6-7 days its 19k. What's with that?
3,"I chose monitor over the Acer VG271 because of its mentioned that XV has better panel, color accuracy and ergonomic option thinking it'd worth my extra 5k but I was wrong as per the side by side comparison with my BenQ ew2775zh (FHD 60hz) which is a regular monitor I was extremely disappointed by Acer's panel and color accuracy.. its very dull in blackness, but fine in bright colors, the viewing angle mentioned are 178 degree but its almost like a TN panel. You don't even get to see anything same if you compare the colors from center to corner of the screen.This monitor is a charm solely for gamers and media consumers, 144hz makes things extremely smooth even the little things like scrolling and mouse pointer movement makes a HUGE improvement in smoothness.Compared to my 13k BenQ monitor I expected Acer to show atleast decent colors since my BenQ mon is not a designer or creative's choice its just a regular cheap monitor that gets things done so it was a shock for me to see my 13k mon outperform this 30k monitor in color accuracy, viewing angle and in light bleeding.I'd say don't choose this monitor if you are not going to use the ergonomics much you can easily find a vesa under 2.5k and attach it to Acer VG271 otherwise if you don't mind spending extra 5k and keep things simple go for this.Decent for gaming, 100% not recommend for creative work."
5,"This is great 2k monitor for less than 25k price range. Picture quality is very sharp and colors are accurate as this is pre callibrate monitor. Panel is bright, even at 50% p rightness it feel very bright in normal lighting condition. Text is very sharp even viewing from close distance doesn't feel distorted. I didn't noticed any major back light bleeding whit my unit. To get 144hzd you must connect it to display port with display port 1.4 cable (which you need to buy separately and), also for better experience good to have HDMI 2.2 cable. Monitor is heavy and stand is firm but wobbles when you try to adjust monitor tilt, so make sure you have sturdy table. Overall this is best monitor for gaming, office work, programming, photo n video editing. Go for it."
5,"I'm not a gamer but I'm sure my son will use it for that soon. As a developer and Linux admin and user I think i'll keep it in a consistent vertical position because being able to see the entirety of a website or full length of the code i'm working on or even the full length of a linux update or script run. Scrolling has been minimized to almost nothing. - Such a beautiful thing. And the 4 port usb 3 hub was a big plus.Tip - when you go to turn the monitor vertical, you'll need to tilt it back a bit because it's too tall for the base."
5,Very nice product. Best value-for-money gaming monitor. Gives a tough fight to 40-50k monitors as well. Colour reproduction is fantastic. Sadly my laptop outputs quad hd @ 60hz :( But still sharpness is mindblowing. Every bit worth the price. Pics attached.Only con is that the speakers are really bad. The thinness of monitors nowadays means manufacturers can't attach proper speakers to them. Acer should have included at least a decent one with such a beautiful panel.😍😍🥰👍🏻 Overall highly recommended. Pls hit helpful button if you found it helpful.Edit: Scaling output gives 120 Hz via HDMI. Images much smoother as well as crisp now.
1,"I bought this monitor in april.and i have 6800 for GPU.from the day one once i plugged it in,I have been seeing flickering lines if i choose referesh rate 122/144hz.1st i thought okay may be i need 16A power cord so i got that still the same issue'sthen i though okay may be i need a better DP so i got gold plated 8k monitor 120Hz supporting DP,Still the same issue.so at this point i searched on reddit for it and sure enough ppl have reported pannel issues with this model and advised not to buy it.SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 120HZ OR 144HZ 2K IPS DISPLAY,THIS IS NOT THE ONE."
4,"Its says what it is nothing more. 144@IPS 8Bit+FCR=10Bit Monitor with HDR 400 . However to use it properly calibration of Gamma is required. Because default gamma makes is stupidly dark.This could be the reason many says it has terrible black light uniformity. Because by default Gamma is set to 2.4. If you set it to 2.0 from settings and you are golden. 2.4 gamma is for Apple retina displays, why acer chose to put 2.4 as default for this monitor is either naïve or a firmware bug. Secondly If you want to enjoy HDR go buy an HDR TV not this.Brightness is less adjustable so mind that.Buy if its specs suits ur needs. Otherwise Asus or LG if you have enough cash to burn.$$"
4,"On my first order, I got a monitor with a defective speaker but the panel was good with no backlight bleed and minimal IPS glow. I then sent it for replacement and ordered a new one but this one has minimal backlight bleed but speakers are working fine. Going to keep this one since the seller has now increased the price also and I can live with the minimal BLB."
4,"I give 4 out of 5 stars to this product (Acer Nitro XV 27U). But why?? first of all the colour accuracy of this monitor is beyond my expectations... The colours look on this monitor is just perfect. A 27 inch huge display with 2k resolution (support upto 4k, not recommended) and HDR400 support makes it a true pleasure to use. But  it has a major issue...its about it brightness. When I use this monitor any mode (I.e. SDR, ECO,GAMING or else) other than Hdr400 or auto mode, the screen brightness is down to very low even when brightness is set at 100.It is really very disappointing. But when you set the screen setting at auto with windows hdr mode on then all the problems are solved.I donot know whether it is a technical faulte or company makes it as it is?? The gaming experience on this monitor is very enjoyable (no issue with that). It supports 120 Hz with hdmi cable at 1080 p and 60 Hz at 2k resolution (this may be for my graphics card which is gtx 750 Ti). Overall it is a very recommendable product(price to performance ratio).Go for it as all I can say."
2,Picture quality is pretty bad.. Also I had dead pixel and light bleeding problems.. Got replacement and it also had the same issue.. Then got a refund and called for an acer equivalent.. Very happy with that..
3,"The stand provided is really good!The picture quality is not that good, as you can notice the pixels and icons are a little pixelated.For gaming it's good.Brightness is terrible, it's really low and you can't control it!!The stands are good quality but if you play games like me with the keyboard as in the pic, you will have to eventually get another stand cause it's very hard to put the keyboard without getting in contact with the stand."
5,"HONESTLY.. For gamer and designer people, compared it with another monitors totally is good especially 144Hz monitors.And never ever buy AOC 23 inch"
5,Good product  nice
3,"Well besides all the pros and cons, no one seems to tell u abt: 1. the 16 amp power cable which won't fit ur 6 amp normal socket.  But don't worry u can use ur normal 6 amp power cable from ur older computer.2. No display port cable or dp cable.Without which u can't turn on freesync on or gsync adaptability on. U can't just buy any dp cable. Do some research before u buy. I am still looking for one.3. Do check ur unit after receiving it. U can use "" eizo monitor test"". Google it. It comes with simple instruction.4. 24.5 inch monitor compared to 32 inch TV is shown in picture.5. Rest is gud so far. Total satisfaction is a subjective matter. So u can't just listen to someone's review. Do ur research first. Think critically and logically.6. This is my first purchase of 144 hz ips monitor. Will update later if any changes occur."
5,"My first high refresh rate monitor & im not familiar with high ref. monitors but when i heard about this bad ass! i thought she is the one and only one who will suit me... ppl says those speakers were suttle i dont think so... i sold my 5.1 surround coz this speakers were enough for me and my room!Go for this and worth the buyingQuality wise there is some build issues but we are not going to use this for trekking, its going to seated in a corner of our room right!and first I got a unit with dead pixel later I returned it within the return period and got a good unit and this review is almost a couple of months later and yes still I love her !"
5,Console gaming monitor 10/10. Not all monitors support high frame rate compatibility with consoles this one does officially and excellent for the purpose . Other tasks are done perfectly as well . With a screen time of 15 hours at stretch no strain on the eyes surprised.
5,"Based on the usage for 3 daysI was confused between buying lggl650f and benq ex2510.the reason I went for benq ex2510 was becausea)24 inch is better than 27inch for a 1080p laptop(after seeing it  I can confirm 24 inch is better)b)this one has speaker but lg model doesn’t have a speakerC) this model was launched in 2020 while the log model was launched in 2019.I was also confused between ASUs vg259q and this model but this model had a good advantage:A) this model hdmi port version is 2.0 (supports upto 144hz) while ASUs model supports hdmi port with support max(60hz)My laptop only had hdmi port and not display port .Coming to pros/cons in general:Pros:1.Good display (luckily I got a screen which has minimal bleeding)2.connectivity- HDmI port to connect to hdmi port in laptop (which can provide 144hz-depends on your graphics card3.it is equally good for gaming /entertainment  /coding4.decent speakers - from my study on gaming monitors models-this monitor speaker is better than other gaming monitorsCon:1)it has a 16a power cable( although it can work with 6a power cable)-need to buy a 16a to 6a converter to connect to a 6a socket2)can’t rotate to portrait mode (for me it’s ok, but it’s still a con)3) service might become a problem in India .(they have affiliated service centre’s only)Overall I feel this as a good buy for 19900 if u are confused between lggl650f ,ASU’s vg259q and ex2510."
5,"I am writing this review after using this monitor for almost 1 month. You may be able to find other 1080P 144hz 24 inch monitors at a lower price point but I can assure you that this is one of the most premium 1080P 144hz 24inch monitor one can find.  This monitor uses premium AU Optronics panel instead of the cheap Chinese panels found inside with many MSI, Gigabyte, Lenovo monitors. In comparison to other brand monitors in its segment including Samsung and LG monitors this monitor has the fastest pixel response time with negligible IPS glow if at all any.Gaming on this monitor is sharp, vibrant and fluid experience, everything is so balanced. The difference you experience from upgrading a non-adaptive sync 60hz monitor to this monitor is phenomenal. You will feel as if you also upgraded your GPU such is the smoothness in frames you experience with this monitor. It comes with various OSD modes and features, one feature I really find helpful is the ""Light Tuner"" It becomes very handy when your gaming scenes have dark locations. By toggling this feature one can get clearer details in games while on dark scenes, a tactical advantage I would say. Watching YouTube, HD movies etc are all a pleasant, delighting experience.The monitor comes with HDMI 2.0 support and the bundled HDMI cable is enough for you to get 1080P 144Hz with FreeSync enabled when using a supported AMD GPU. My GPU is an RX 570 and I have no problems is getting 1080P 144Hz FreeSync enabled. It also comes with a DisplayPort so for Nvidia users to enable their G-Sync they can use DisplayPort instead.The monitor build is very solid. I was pleasantly surprised at the weight of the stand's main arm which almost weighted like a mini dumbbells (not kidding). I got this monitor for 20K which is value for money for such a premium gaming monitor. Overall I am happy with what I bought and I trust BenQ reliability. If you are looking for a premium 24inch 144hz 1080P gaming experience this is it."
2,"Bought this monitor after a lot of research. But it did not mention anywhere that you need a 16 amp power outlet, the one that you need for microwaves and A/Cs. Even 55in TVs use 6 amp plugs. The funny part is the monitor's power input location indicates that it needs the standard 1.6 amp"

5,great for gaming nd watching movies i personally recommend buy at around 18500 gud for this price u get great deal
5,"Where do i start from, it uses AU optronics panel which is much better than panda panel, Colours out of the box are perfectly calibrated, very vibrant, My unit has almost zero noticeable ips glow, monitor gets very bright enough and it’s eyeCare technology makes proper use of that sensor which adapts screen brightness and temperature. Im using this with my rtx 3070 with dp cable and yea gsync works when you enable it in nvdia panel. Box was perfectly packed and sealed. Go for it, you won’t regret. Overall it feels and performs premium it has better stand although bit bulky."
5,"I was using a 144hz tn panel before and it didnt had any Blur reduction so in games like valorant, CSGO it helps a lot. It's plenty Bright and vibrant to be used inside a room with good lightning. I actually at first received a unit with backlight bleed which i got replaced and now it literally have zero bleed."
5,"Picture quality is awesome, display is bright enough I'm using at 80%.Build quality is good.There are no issues in the display penal i received.Can refresh at 144hz through both hdmi and display port (hdmi cable only inside box).Inbuilt speakers are average, good sounding for built-in speakers.HDR is meh, sometimes is looks good, sometimes ok.Auto brightness feature is cool, works as intended.All in all its a good monitor for under 21k with premium features like amd free sync premium, also supports nvidia G sysnc (only works through display port cable)."
5,This benq ex2510 monitor is great for competitive gaming. It has lot feature and someone of the features are worst like low blue light filter and especially HDRi. HDR in this monitor is like colour filter. This monitor is lot better compared to other monitors in this price range (for competitive gaming). I really love it.
5,"There are similar monitors you'll get for 13k, but believe me they are not the same.This BENQ MONITOR is an IPS display 144hz. This means none of that yellow annoying shade you get with TN panels.Picture quality makes me drool. Remember that if you want full 144hz experience, you need a DP CABLE (NOT HDMI CABLE).It supports hdmi cable, but it will give only upto 120hz."
4,"Its the first time I bought an external monitor. Asked from friends. Was going to buy the 144hz version but then saw that this one was lower priced. And supplied by Appario. I'm a gamer (dota) and coder at fang, so staying in front of screen for long time periods is natural.I keep the eyecare on the whole day and its fine for me. Installation was good (one hour just to figure my power source) the rotation is six degree.Doesnt go vertical, not that I need thatI like the refresh rate. Way better than my 60 hz laptop screen.I would recommend this monitor!"
5,This is my first Gaming monitor. Before that i was using viewsonic old monitor which i bought in 2015. Just want to say that switching from 60 hz to 144 hz with this much small response time is totally aly amazing. I mostly play online fps games like cod and battlefield and that totally changed my game. Apart from using it on pc i use it on my console too like ps3 and ps4 dont make much of a difference though on older console because of fps lock but change in fps is totally unnoticeable. Screen looks amazing brightness is good too hdri mode is not much of a use.l but that light sensor is amazing i always turned on that feature it sets the brightness according to your room light and that is very handy feature.In short go for it without the 2nd thought in this price range this is one of the best monitor.
5,"I've been a gamer for a long time now, and this was my first time using a high refresh rate monitor, and the change was BIG!! You don't realize how much more convenient it gets once you actually get to see the difference in fps. I play fortnite and I can confirm that since I started using this monitor, my gameplay has improved significantly. Another good thing about this is that it has eye protection, which is something BenQ is kinda famous for, so you can long gaming sessions without straining your eyes... however, when it comes to color, as a VFX student, I must say it's not up to the mark. Color is another thing BenQ is famous for, but this monitor isn't the best for color grading or color correction; you can get monitors with better color output for much lower prices, but that'd mean sacrificing this amazing refresh rate."
5,Very good monitor in budget/mid-range for gaming/editing photos/videos and comes with multiple port options !!Got it at a good price in sale from Amazon.
3,"In few days i found that product is cuteNice display for screen savers but sound quality is very poor.very strange that manufacture keeping the price is very high, but sound quality is very bad.not to buy.if not improved.no software for digital screen colour brightness settings."
5,This product is best for 1080p gaming by a mile. The ips panel gives 99%srgb color scale. The in built speakers are average… not that great but they do the average job. Dont use it as a TV i would say. 144hz with amd freesync gives smooth display. Although its not g-sync certified u can enable it thru nvidia control panel using a display port. Tbh i researched a lot before buying this monitor and i can say it exceeded my expectations.
5,"This monitor gives you a very good experience. You will probably not regret buying this if you compare the specifications, features and price of other 1080p IPS 144hz monitors provided by competitor brands. The stand is excellent and sturdy, with customizable height and ability to change viewing angle. This monitor has sRGB calibration, so it can be used for both video and photo editing purposes. The amount of colour modes and features provided with this monitor is respectable. I would definetly reccommend to buy this monitor. Its amazing for its price range. Can be used for both productivity work and casual/competitive gaming without any hassle. Thank you Amazon for providing me this monitor at a reasonable price."
3,Got my Monitor replaced after receiving Defective unit at first with bad backlight bleed and IPS Glow.But the replaced new Unit was really good.Although packaging of replacement unit was concerning and specifically stand alone feels old.Good IPS monitor as long as you get a good unit.
5,Display gets pretty bright and is also color accurate. I'm using this for casual FPS and Netflix. It has hdri mode which I find lack luster along with the inbuilt speakers. But otherwise it's a solid display. Build quality is good too.
3,"I have tried different monitors less than this price range, and bought this item concerning only about the build quality, but sadly this monitor also has backlight bleed issue."
5,"I suggest you watch the review by Hardware Unboxed channel on YouTube.In summary this has the best pixel response time ~4.5 ms. The refresh rate is truly 144 hz!Only concerns are -1. A bit expensive, 17K should be the ideal price2. The panel only has 100% sRGB gamut coverage"
5,"5 star productGood colors, Good design, High refresh rate, great for PS5.Fully satisfied with the monitor."
5,Video Player is loading.
3,"For gaming you could get higher refresh rate monitor at a cheaper price.Color accuracy is okay but blacks weren't deep enough for me.Not value for money, hdri is just a marketing gimmick as it only an 8bit panel. The automatic brightness sensor is useless as it was always very bright for my eyes."
5,Excellent monitor with great colors. Have been a gamer for around 10 years.. found no issue in last 5 months in this monitor.. you can go ahead for competitive gaming... If you also want to watch series and videos then yes highly recommend...
5,"The monitor is absolutely fantastic and performs satisfactorily for gaming. Viewing angles are great, build quality is amazing144hz makes everything look butter smooth"
5,"Anyone looking for 1080p HDR monitor Stop looking. This is it. HDR works beautifully for HDR content like PS4 gaming. For non HDR content, HDR is emulated which looks good."
1,Picture is often smudged. Huge stuttering issues that is evident even with adaptive synch on and off. Tried all the picture modes and nohting could handle the darker black shades. Don't buy this .
4,"Amazing monitor. Colors are accurate and has a very bright display. I have never used it beyond 40 brightness level.One thing to keep in mind is that it's a 24.5 inch panel with 1080p resolution, so the clarity is a bit less but nothing that bothers me much nor does it strain my eyes."
5,"Good refresh rate, 1ms response time and 144hz. The picture quality is also good.But remember that you will need a Display port if you want access 144hz refresh rate. You can't get it with a home cable."
4,Perfect monitor for gaming and everyday work. The swivel and tilt function is very good. Just if it could have more io ports I would have given 5 stars
5,Superb
4,"Monitor arrived with a stuck blue pixel, visible only on black screen. Ordered for replacement, arrived after a lot of days, only this time it was a dead pixel, overall not a good experience, ordered for refund."
5,"Out of the box every mode has that yellow tint for eye protection, My settings are Custom with R 90 g90 b 100 as i don't like yellow tint that much, as i can easy turn on Night light in windows if i have eye Strain"
5,My review for BENQ MOBIUZ 24.5I am using it for 1 month now. Its awesome experience for me you should go for it. And thanks to appario retails for perfect product.
5,This monitor is awesomeNo doubts
5,"I was sceptical while placing the order for ""zebster"" monitor which is a new product from a well known brand ZEBRONICS! Which I dint know and no where its mentioned online too. But when I got the product, the user manual and warranty card, everything had manufactured by ZEBRONICS! I was at peace! Also apparently this is the cheapest HDMI Monitor on Amazon India!"
2,"Unlike product description, this is not an LED Backlit Monitor but an LCD monitor. There is light backlighting on the left and right of the screen which may be additional LED lighting as can be seen in the attached pic. It is very annoying and bright in comparison to the rest of the screen.Average quality Monitor. This is enough for me as it is a second monitor, however it is not very pleasing for viewing purposes if used as a main monitor. Buy another higher budget monitor if your looking to buy a monitor for your computer or as a mini TV...(Edited) - I had to initiate a return. The monitor started showing dead pixels within a few days of usage. From very obvious backlight bleeding to dead pixels this early, this monitor is no longer worth the cost of purchase."
1,"1. Power button would not work.2. No power saving.3. Monitor flashes different colours without signal4. Is a LCD backlit. Not LED. Even with zero brightness the blacks were dull grey5. Even with HDMI support, cable supplied is VGA onlyOverall give this a pass. The same monitor is sold my multiple sellers, though Zebronics will probably honor warranty.Look for used monitors instead at half this price - though these will generally not have HDMI"
1,"Monitor quality is acceptable in this price range, but the seller is not giving ""Big Beat Fast Charge Data Cable Combo by Maxy!"" as mentioned in product description."
3,"Product details says it has HDMI port but doesn't have it. I was shocked, I checked the catalogue to confirm it because I may miss the port somewhere hidden but didn't found even on the catalogue. Yeah guys this monitor don't have HDMI port."
4,Bought in urgent need but find it really good. It's clearity is far better than other monitors.

5,"This LG monitor is very bright. You can turn down brightness to ease viewing. This is a TN monitor so viewing angle is limited, however I found the viewing angles are sufficient for working on a table and doing office work or studying. May not be suitable if you are thinking to buy it for watching videos/movies from bed or sofa etc.Monitor is sturdy, the buttons work fine you can choose to keep power LED indicator on or off. I have changed it to on, by default off is selected. The VGA cable is ok but power cord is thin. Also the plug is a power adaptor itself, So it takes up more place than an ordinary 3 pin plug. But the monitor stays cool as the power supply board (SMPS) is outside monitor housing.This is not a HD monitor. It has resolution of only 1366x768. This was a common standard 10 years ago. In 2021 when YT is streaming 1K, 2K, 4K videos this monitor can't make use of those HD videos, as it can show only 720 p videos and all higher resolution videos will not improve quality over 720p. In 2021 a non-HD monitor at 5299/- (I spent) is bit over priced. This is a compromise with viewing quality, similar sized monitor with 1600x900 or higher resolution will have more clearer pictures.Final verdict is This monitor is suitable for study and office purpose. So, for students and office workers it serves its purpose pretty well.But, if you have money to spend, then go for a FHD IPS monitors for better picture and video quality, for better and vibrant colour reproductions and for wide viewing angles."
5,"Good for office purpose. Screen is Little bit brighter and can give pain in eyes on constant working, however one can decrease the brightness and use it for office purpose."
1,picture quality is very badonly usable for office work like excel and web browsing
4,Dont buy this monitor from amazon. Because the price  real price is below 5000.Mrp 6100.....  Amazon price 6000. Now above 8000.too much cheating
5,"I bought this only for ₹4299 .This is tiltable you can adjust as you wish (up-down)This will give you high definition performance (I'll not recommend this for gaming)If you are on a tight budget like I was(below ₹25k)Then buddy this is for you.Wait for the price drop, no need to rushGrab the item once it comes under ₹4300 or less."

4,"If you are looking for a QHD monitor under 18K, this is the only option. Best part is, it has vesa mount too. I am using it with Macbook Pro along with LG ultrawide fhd monitor. QHD 24 inch provides crisp pictures and text on screen and it's much better than same sized fullHD monitors. Colors are nice, punchy and accurate with 99% sRGB. I compared it against macbook's display side by side. They just look the same. I don't see this monitor or any other Lenovo monitor listed in Lenovo India official website. Hope the warranty is applicable in India. I would suggest this to anyone who wants QHD with Vesa mount under 20K. You don't have better options right now. Thanks."
4,"First of all if you are purchasing for coding, just don't get the 1080p monitors. They are great till 17 inches. After that if you have good vision, you won't enjoy reading, or anything that has to do with text. I got a curved 24inch 1080p va monitor and it was great for gaming and gaming only. The text was fuzzy and blurry and it started giving me headache. This is by no means a great choice but the only choice available under 20k. You get qhd, around 33% more pixels than 1080p, flat ips panel. But the refresh rate is a bummer though. Just 75hz, they could have given 90hz and charged 2k extra and made it 20k. But it's what it is. As long as you're a casual gamer and 75hz is enough for you, you'll be good with this."
5,I am using it for a month now.Here are the pros1. Very light weight.2. Display is crisp and looks gorgeous3. Controls are sufficient to adjust brightness and block blue light.4. Extremely thinI am using it with Amazon basics stand as it has vesa mount support. Now I can also adjust height and rotate the screen as well with ease.The only con1. Price when compared to international marketing is higher.P.S. I bought it for 23k
4,"It's over a good buy but I do miss the big screen, the issue in big 27inch screen is that you need to sit at a distance and I had no much space so I settled for this 24 inch.. rest every thing is fine"
5,No problems with the piece as yet. East to set up. Very nice size - big but not too big for a desktop.Movies look good.
5,2K monitor in this size feels just perfect. I would love to have a 4K monitor but this is great value for money and has a clean design and good picture quality and has even backlighting .
5,"Have been using it for 10 days now, no significant complaints. Will update after 3 months of usage. QHD at 24 inch is a sweet spot, you can easily see the diff from a FHD monitor at 24 inch. Colors are good, contrast is good for an IPS display."
2,Doesn't support macbook pro 2019 model.
5,"The only 24-inch QHD monitor under 20k. The product won't disappoint you, not suitable for hardcore gamers but if you are looking for coding and movies this should be your pick."
5,Good monitor for work from home
5,"Best qhd 24in monitor for it's price. Ideal for working with small text. However, stand is too wobbly."
1,Not getting 2k resolution in MacBook Air 2019 model. Only till 1080p available.
5,Very good
5,"Value for money, 1440p in less than 20k"
5,"Easily the best Value for Money QHD monitor in the market right now ! I had purchased this back last month, when there were initially no reviews and was sceptical as to how it would perform. And it has done really well so far ! 27 inch QHD is the sweet spot as far as image quality is concerned, and will make for a good investment for quite a number of years."
5,"Amazing monitor , good colours and 144fps . Works with nvedia gsync also i can confirm from 48fps to 144fps.Can get this for 16k in local shops. Blindly buy this monitor its super good.Edit = out of the box the monitor comes with very bad calibration. Please change it to this red - 50,green-42,blue-33 and adjust brightness based on your room it comes with 100% which can cause eye strain. I have decreased mine to 65%.Please click on helpful Below so more people can see this."
5,"Aoc c24g1 24 inch curved VA 144hz monitorI switched from a 75hz ips lg 24 inch monitor to this and 144hz is a different experience provided your gpu can push the frames.I run a ryzen 2600+rtx2060 so me no problem pushing 1080p 120+ frames in maximum gamesI play most of my games on very low to low settings for that max fps and to enjoy the 144hz max refresh rate.Ok so now the monitor -This has a freesync mode and a mbr(motion blur reduction mode) you can only play with one and for the people wondering this is gsync compatible just goto Nvidia control panel and switch it to gsync compatible if you're playing with freesyncMBR - this has a value from 1-20 and as your go higher you lose brightness mbr reduces ghosting and the images seems more smoother best for fps games like pubg,cs.Curve : for the guys wondering the 24 inch has 1500r curve vs 27inch has 1800rAfter buying this I was regretting the purchase as I thought I shouve bought a flat monitor as they will be way better than curve I used the monitor felt weird for like an hour or so and then got into the zone I was playing pubg it took me 2 days to get used to the curve, it seems like a big deal at first then u get used to it so don't worry you wont lose that competitive edge. I followed the pcmonitor reviews guide and downloaded the icc color profile etc withUser color profile r-50 g-42 b-38 mbr set to 10 andbrightness to 75Got good results but after a months switched back to normal color setting and freesync as i find it more comfortable for my eyes.Pros:-144hz + mbr (this feature probably sets this monitor apart from other curved VA Panels)-Good customizability options-sturdy stand-mic jackCons:-retarded on screen controls, holy shit guys this is so annoying when each time you restart your monitor it resets the mbr to 0 good luck resetting it to 10 when the on screen commands auto close for some reason.-still using buttons to do most shit : you can download the software to change most setting from the aoc site but that still doesn't change mbrConclusion :Buy it , it's probably better or as good as flat tn panels of this price range you get mbr ,just get used to resetting it each restart."
5,"Amazing product. Looks like quality product from the get go! Shipped with all 3 cables: HDMI, DP and VGA, very rare in monitors.I was replacing with my old LG 23MP68VQ which itself was a great monitor with IPS.Although this is a VA panel, I found it be better in almost every way. Some people have complained about text clarity in Windows which had made me skeptical, but you can see in my picture that text clarity is also amazing (I found it be better than my LG's IPS).G-Sync works perfectly with my GTX 1060 (works through all framerates from 1 fps to 144 fps as it is Freesync 2 with LFC enabled - Low Framerate Compensation)Seems this is a newer version than what is shown in the earlier reviews. Best settings for a great picture are as follows:Best settings: (based on the Warm setting 6500k)Red: 50Green: 38Blue: 33Brightness: 40 (The monitor is way too bright and can be used in any lighting, mine is ideal for a room with curtains and some sunlight).You'll also hear comparisons with the other AOC C24G2 which is IPS and I'm sure it is also good, but the G1 is soo good, it hardly seems useful to wait for G2's launch in India (if it does).This is the way monitors are made to be. Forget everything else, this is the monitor to buy! Just go for it. AOC now is right there with LG (in my mind) as a premium monitor vendor."
1,"screen suffers from heavy back-light bleed,hard copy of manual was missing in the box,energy star rating sticker was missing too.i have requested for a replacement.i guess this product was used before for a brief time and then returned.A request to all those who are buying it to please check screen in a dark background.i hope the replacement is worthy enough to wait again for 1 week.sellers know about defects but still deliver faulty products because people compromise with quality."
3,"The monitor is very good for gaming, yet when you watch video it's got a lot of lag...light bleeds slightly on top corners, but this model itself is like this...I kept the replacement piece...it's got warranty but not the best support because their website doesn't have this model on product registration page, and a lot of guidelines on how a technician is going to come to your house for service and there are a ton of charges associated with it...I think they made a faulty model and this is just a trick up the sleeve to sell it...I like it's style, but the panel has serious light bleeding issues...Update - 2nov2020 - got an Acer nitro VG240Y Sbmiipx ... With speakers built in, IPS panel with 165hz refresh rate, 0.5ms RT... lovely colors, no bleed, superb panel, got it for 13k...far better choice and quality than this curved uselessness....thank you"
5,received used and defective product with a dead pixel need replacementedit : got replacementmonitor is outstandingpicture quality and colours are too good and so is responsivenessfrom my end it’s highly recommended
5,"Writing review after using for 9 days, I m from Maharashtra kolhapurPros :-1) no dead pixels on arrival2) zero screen bleeding3) zero flickering4) hight adjusting feature is top notch5) build quality superb ( the stand is pretty heavy & sturdy6) you can adjust all types of monitor setting using AOC software7)Looks are killer8) viewing angles are good for a curve display - 90/1009) package was best took almost 15min to unboxing10) best for gaming11) best monitor in Indian market according to me got for Rs1549912) display , HDMI ,vga cables includedCons:1) can't use in open sunlight 😅  Brightness not as good as ips - 90/1002) sharpness is not up to mark but I don't  care because it is not issue while gaming  & watching movies3) service center is not available in my city  but who cares we are not going to live  forever 😅😅😅####why not to buy accer- dead pixels issue after using few months- dead pixels on arrival- heating issue- worst build quality- service center are just for name sake- sellers who are selling accer have worst rating- 60% displays have screen bleeding issues"
2,"I have used my Laptop 17"" IPS panel for 3 years, and Acer b227Q 21.5"" IPS for 4 years.. Tried few other models before going for this 144hz for playing fps games, before buying i tested this for an hour as my friend had the same, sure 75hz to 144hz is pleasing when it comes to smoothness. Because of screen size and height adjustment posture ergonomics improved a lot, but the EYES got strained fully along with headache and been using for over 3 weeks now with everyday adjusting color settings and brightness set to 0, used my laptop screen just now to realize there is something else wrong(not the settings), 75hz without having to strain to focus is thanking my eyes.Found in reddit, many users have returned the product because of the same reason and it is mainly due to VA panels having odd pixel layout and half pixels making it hard to focus, sadly i cannot return this now :(If you are gamer like me(CSGO,DotA,Valorant) and looking to buy this over TN panels for the viewing angles, 1ms mPRT response etc, please don't fall for it. I don't know why this has so much good reviews."
5,Good brightness indoor especially when viewing movies or gamesColors are amazing my display had little greens reducing by 5 point solved it and was surprised it came out this accurate out of the boxFor competitive  games this display is an absolute blast with overdrive settings set to medium players do not smear at all literally improved my skillsBeing a first time user on curve display it feels trippy to me but i personally like the curveI recommend over acer(ips) and other tn panels
5,"Easily the best gaming monitor in its price range. I have been using it for a year and I have no complaints.Pros:- 144Hz refresh rate - amazing for gaming, and has very little ghosting compared to other models at this range- Great color accuracy and deep blacks.- The curve is very subtle and helps with immersiveness.- Freesync means no tearing of image, no matter you have an AMD or an Nvidia GPU.Cons:- 1080p Resolution, which isn't bad but might feel less if you're coming from a laptop with a 2/4k screen.- Color accuracy isn't as great as an IPS and peak brightness isn't very high. Although I rarely crank the brightness up to 100% myself, it can be a problem if someone has sunlight coming in front of the monitor."
5,"I'm gonna start by saying that this one is an underrated product in the Indian market where people are blindly going in the name ""IPS Displays"" without actually seeing the actual quality of those displays.Features:1. Panel - This one has a curved VA panel which is best in this price range. It gets really bright, its anti-glare & is very legible in a room with daylight. The curve actually created an immersive experience for me. Out of the box calibration is not optimised, change it to RED:50, GREEN: 42 & BLUE: 33, then it looks pleasantly natural.2. High refresh - This is a 144HZ panel which is Gsync & Freesync compatible. I haven't faced any ghosting or input lags, checkout reviews from outside India, its claimed to be best in class for this budget. Gsync is only available if you connect using DisplayPort (blame AMD for making it proprietary), adaptors won't work.3. Backlight bleed - There's none. Best in this price.4. Stand - The stand lets you move the monitor vertically & horizontally (30 to -30deg), which is great feature to have, which the competition is not offering5. Package contents - It comes with a HDMI, Display & VGA cable, crazy right?Its a very good deal compared to the competition, marvelous job AOC!!The version 2 of this monitor is even better but it won't come to India any soon.I got this for ₹15600 with an offer."
5,"For those who have less budget and want high refresh rate monitor you can definitely go for this monitor because it offers 144hz in very cheap and the VA panel is amazing.At first I was using 19/20inch monitor and now 24inch man it's so big to me I think I'll have to adjust myself with this monitor XDThe OSD offers tons of features, I know it has buttons instead of joystick 🕹️ but you won't be disappointed with buttons because they're easily pressable without making any noise.And yeah u can adjust this monitor in many ways that's a great point about this monitor 👍"
5,"If u guys r switching ur monitor from a basic 60 fps to this one than go for it.The colors are very good and the brightness is also pretty good.Remember that 144hz works only with DisplayPort.Other companies like MSI, Samsung , and etc also have the same specifications with nearly the same price but this monitor will give u a satisfaction in case of color and brightness.I hope u guys found this review helpful and sorry in advance for hurting anybody feelings, I hope u guys will have a good time"
5,First unit had a dead pixel so had to replace it..2nd one is spotless..144 hz Curved Display with Great Picture quality with vibrant and bright colours with great view range and minimal back light bleed..Curve of 1500R also adds to immersion and looks cool..im happy with this product and would recommend under 15k
4,"Just got the product and it's amazing. Love the colours and the packaging was super good, everything was there and the box was sealed. The only little problem was that there was a very small dead pixel but it is not visible as it's very small so doesn't bother too much. Very good for the price. Would Recommend"
2,Text clarity is not good..It looks fuzzy from close as subpixel Layout In VA panel is weird..But looks good if you watch from distance..Good for movies and games..but for daily work its strictly avoided...IPs panel is good anytime in image and text clarity but it lacks of high responce time.
5,"It's an absolute steal. I used a tn panel monitor before and now when I use this monitor, it's a huge difference. All the colors pop and is beautiful to look at. The thin bezels also add style to the monitor and the stand is just amazing. Getting a monitor with a stand like this is hard at this price point."
5,"This display is absolutely phenomenal, it's picture quality is very noticeable for me as i was using a 7 year old 720p TN panel so this is a real game changer for me.I colour calibrated the monitor from one of the reviews here and lowered it's brightness to 50 as this monitor gets very bright.You get three cables in the box ie vga,hdmi and display port which is fantastic choice provided to us by the manufacturer.144hz is working smoothly for me through display port cable provided, just had to update the monitor drivers from Aoc's website for it to work.The mobility this monitor offers like height adjustment, tilt, swivel, portrait mode is not even provided by any other competitor in this range.The blacks get deep and colours have a rich contrast.In my opinion its the best choice for people who would like to game and also like to watch movies, shows etc on the same monitor.It doesn't have any noticeable backlight bleed for me and the colours are very uniform across the panel, this panel also doesn't have any dead/defective pixels as for me.This monitor was delivered to me in one day thanks to Amazon, the monitor stays stafe inside the box, it was wrapped well although i would have preferred them to wrap it first in bubble wrap then the amazon wrapping.Overall a very good monitor."
5,Packing was done well I was suspicious about buying monitor online bcoz of damage and returning time waste things but the product was good condition when arrived after unpacking setting up will only takes 5min max not tested with big games only played League of legends so not sure about fps but color pallet was good.
5,"The monitor looks absolutely gorgeous. It's a steal at this price. Have hooked up my playstation to this. I only wish HDR was available.Amongst the touted display, I really like how easy it is to move the monitor from the pivot. It tilts, curves, moves up and down, back and forth."
1,The LED has come with a 16A plug which is not what is mentioned in the box. This has caused too much hassle as we normally would not have such big plug point. We are still not able to use this as we now need to call an electrician who is not available now a days as we are having a lockdown. Too difficult and inconvenient.
4,"The monitor is working fine. The display port that came with it fried my GPU, and it’s no longer working. I have been using my GPU HD 6950 for 10 years now, and it will no longer boot up my pc anymore after I plugged the DISPLAY PORT. The cables are live and I feel current through them. I would recommend buy your own cables if you don’t want your pc parts being affected. Monitor otherwise is nice so far. I am still observing it for another few days."
5,"After using it for a few weeks now for my office work and casual gaming, I can say that this is a good monitor with a good selection of ports. Go for it."
4,Great picture quality and colours after a little calibration red 50 blue 42 green 33 picture mode gamer 3.But osd buttons are horrible. 1 star for thatStand adjustablity is great.Super thin bazzels .Overall worth the prize. Got it for 16300Price fluctuate frequently.Worth the price got a samsung sva panel.
5,Quality is best for gaming and entertaining. I Got it 14k in festival sales....using bank offers. Features are awasome horizontal & vertical & up down movement available
5,Got the monitor for 14k and i have to say the build quality is premium level you can adjust the height easily and the curved screen and good display quality makes it ideal for people who watch movies and 144hz refresh rate is great for gaming.In short a great product by Aoc.
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Excellent monitor. Got it in a deal. But delivered monitor with dead pixel even after replacement. No quality check from Amazon. Decided to keep it since no replacement available third time.
5,I'm using it for 1month now. It is very good monitor for mid-range PC gaming. Only concern is how warranty and service will be done. But so far no problems found.
3,"Really good value for money, but came with a dead pixel, buy a more expensive monitor if you can. The colour, and especially the contrast on this thing are absolutely amazing and it's such a shame that it had to have one dead pixel. I'm keeping it until there are more, as it doesn't bother me that much."
4,"A bit of screen bleeding.value for the money.good quality for picture .Cons-Contains a 16 amp plug , need to purchase a 5amp power chords extra.Its works fine on 5amp power chords."
4,Monitor is one of the best in class for gaming.control buttons are little annoying. Package is awesome and delivery was on time. Very sturdy built. Stylish look.
3,Fantastic.... Nicely packed. Delivered on time.After some use....display panel problem.
5,It is well to our expectations
5,"Best for gaming . And nice and curved monitor. My laptop out put hdmi 2.0 and this monitor hdmi 1.4 but, don’t know why ? I can access 144hz . Too much happy ❤️"
5,"Omg! Was my first impressions , seriously curved + 144 for 14K ?!! Go for it it's the best in range of 15K"
5,Worth buying
2,Look at this
5,"Delivered with 3 cables: VGA, HDMI and DP. Brightness and contrast was better than my expectations at this price range. A must buy for a budget gaming monitor"
5,Awesome
2,"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.Pros :-------Good Contrast ratioIntuitive OSDDecent Build Quality144hzFreesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)Cons :--------Pathetic backlight issues with dim edgesReally bad color calibration out of the boxPanel uniformity issuesGiving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."
5,"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted"
5,Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.Pros:-Cheapest 32 inch display-144 hz freesync works perfect-no dead pixels or backlight bleed-Curve on the screen gives immersive experienceCons:-Display brightness could have been better-No speaker-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down
4,"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.Pros:1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.2.  4 ms response.3. Curve display.4. Has display port.5. 27 inch, quite a big displayCons:1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.Peace."
4,"INTRODUCTION:I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.PRICE:I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.BUILD QUALITY:Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5°~ 20°. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.CURVATURE:The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.UI:UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.IMAGE QUALITY:Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.VIEWING ANGLES:There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.144HZ:Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.FREESYNC:As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.CABLES:The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.SUMMARY:Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money."
5,1.I Have search many monitor but any monitor does not have 144hz refresh rate at low price rate And Aopen is latest one i go only 21000rs2.144hz mindblowing.3.curved super4.eye saver5.High Performance any game without any issue6.21000 all feature i got curve..gaming...144hz...4ms smooooth perfomance7.best scene like watch any movie any side without any issue or blurr8.wqhd available :-)9.beast performance ....beautiful look10.finally Rating 9/1011.one point miss because amazon delivery service one day late(delivery boy not give my product my home address ..i collect product office:-( ) but amazon service and support very good12.amazon product and service always better than flipkart13.finally guys buy this product .....best for every you want
5,This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.
2,"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?"
5,"Pros:Supports upto 4k 144Hz (custom resolution), although the text turns out to be copy as it's not designed for it.HDMI, DP, DVI, cables included within1920x1080 , 144Hz on DP1920X1080 , 120Hz on HDMIFree sync+gSync compatibleImmersive curvature of 1800RFast response time of 4MsColour correction menu from monitor nipple type button on the backNot too big side bezels~1cmImages quality is natural with sRGb colour profile and great viewing angles from sides.VA panel, which is a trade-off for picture quality from IPS panel and response time from TN panelsBright enough display with 250nitsCons:The stand takes some space in front of the screenHeight is non adjustable plus there is no wall mount of any standard Vesa or whatsoeverNot Windows HDR compatible, not that it hurts but it just doesn't support it.I love it.Here on I can not go back to 60hz ever again.Will be back to edit this review after a few weeks.If you're still thinking to buy this, just do it unless you could push your budget to 20k (which basically have the same traits but additional physical features like stand, looks, adjustable heights and all)After about 8 months I first noticed some backlight bleeding when the screen goes blank. I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point."
4,"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.The good :-- Competitive price point.- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).- Curved. Very immersive.- Relatively intuitive OSD.- Adequately deep black levels.The not so good :-- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly."
5,"I found the display port image of 1440p 120hz on a radeon hd6970 fantastic.The other complain of backlight unevenness did not exist when your in front of it, if you go back far and see it from an angle then you see it.Black's are great and clarity fantastic to the pixel on dp only.A lot of calibration settings are there.Very impressive and I'm planning a 3 monitor setup for racing and flight sim as will as productivity.The border less frame feature is a joke, as the screen actually ends much before the illustrative thin border. There's almost 10-15mm of border."
5,"The monitor is excellent , very good picture quality , excellent colour production , the curved screen is a treat to eye and 144hz and freesync at this price range is commendableGo for 24 inch one if full hd resolutionI used to run my console on my tv and now moving to this monitor the increase is quality and performance is very measurable .As all the services and onsite warranty for this product will be provided by Acer there should me no doubt related to the durability of the product.The only con is that it lacks a speaker unit but that doesn't change anything.Go for it"
1,Acer is not written anywhere on the packaging box or on the monitor itself.1) The refresh rate is 119.98Hz and not 144Hx as mentioned in specifications.2) Monitor Speakers do not work.3) It's a local individual brand AOPEN and not Acer.The word Acer is only to be found on the order purchase on Amazon app and nowhere on the actual order. Scam.
1,"I bought this monitor 4 months ago and not gonna lie the product was pretty good until one day the monitors screen got cracked. Honest mistake right? It could happen to anybody! So i did what anyone would do and called the toll free to ask for non warranty service, since they said that this cant be done under warranty. I have tried calling various service centers of acer and all of them tell me that they do not service monitors. I called the HO and try to issue a complain and the representative called me to tell me that if i gave it to them it'll cost as much as buying a new monitor. Honestly, i am still paying emi for this crap. This isnt really a review on how the product is but even if you buy this and by mistake something does happen to it . Say goodbye to your money. These ppl dont care after the product is sold. Think about it before buying because multiple brands are there and they'll probably give you a better service."
4,"Received the monitor today.  Initial impression was quite good.  I was using a 21.5inch full HD Dell touch monitor. Going curved is a great boon with good peripheral vision. Now comes the bummer. Display has a patch of dead pixel at the edge and on standby I saw the screen in just one color, reddish with the entire display looking like a cobweb. Must have something majorly wrong with the piece. Requested for a replacement, hope mine is a odd piece and wont affect long term reliability. As others are have also mentioned similar issues looks more like a production line issue rather than one off.  Hoping for a full rectification of the problem with the replacement. If it works its an excellent monitor esp for work and playing. Being a larger monitor text is larger too which adds on to the eye comfort.Edit: Prompt replacement in just a day, didnt have to wait as the pick up and replacement happened together.  New display has no issues so far."
4,"Using this monitor for 3 months now and here is my review,The curved screen helps for better vision when facing direct.Viewing angles on this monitor are also excellent.Interface is simple to understand and use.In the box VGA, HDMI and DVI all cables are included with good quality built (My favourite thing)Brightness is way too high on this monitor, I keep it in the range of 30-40%Its 1080p but pixels are slightly visible when user mode is changed to gaming or movie.These are the things which are imp for you to know rest part you can check on youtube.Overall its worth the price."
4,"First day review - Got the monitor on the next day after order, box was in good condition, after unboxing the setup was easy it only requires 1 screw to be screwed in. Setting it up connected to the computer and checking there were no dead pixels and very slight amounts of back light bleed (which is to be expected at this price range and screen size), this what i meant by luck as i got lucky with the panel where as your experience might vary given that there are older reviews where people have much worse panels.Verdict - As it is a prime guarantee product and if it has all the features that you need then get it and test it out you might get really lucky with the panel too if not just return it/have it replaced as there is nothing better in the price range if it works well.feel free to ask questions.Edit 1: found a stuck pixel so 4 stars"
5,"This is one of the fantastic monitors you get in this price range.Pros:-> 144Hz display(You will really feel the smoothness once you jump from 60 or 75Hz display).-> VA panel gives great contrast as compared to typical TN panel found in other budget 144Hz Monitor.-> Simply a great Gaming Monitor in budget.Cons:-> When in dark black screen you can see the panel is not A+ grade panel(Doesn't matter as normally you won't be in having black screen all the time).-> Doesn't have Vesa mount option, that's a deal breaker for many(Unless they are fine with low monitor height or can buy monitor stand)Conclusion: If you are looking for a budget 144Hz gaming monitor with Freesync/G-sync support  and no vesa support doesn't bother you, then its a no brainier . Simply go for it. Highly Recommended."
1,"With high hopes, keeping in mind the price to features ratio I ordered this 27""  monitor. Within a month of use it has developed dead pixel. I asked Acer service center for resolution, this is what they replied ""As per your concern, your screen pixels issue comes under CID ( Customer Induce Damage ) so it will not cover under warranty."".I have been using this monitor with utmost care, sitting on desk with APC UPS, no voltage fluctuations or any damage(physical or otherwise)What's the use of 3 year warranty???Don't go for this brand, better buy some other good brand monitor, even If you have to pay little bit more"
5,After getting my replacement of my damaged display monitors i am very happy and after one year of rough usage the monitor works liye the first day it is the best mid ranged monitor and i am very happy to buy theseThank you Amazon my love for you will be always there
4,"Great 144hz affordable monitor. The VA is amazing in terms of colour production as compared to a TN panel.I play CS, PUBG and APEX nowadays. This monitor does the job pretty well.Don't get confused with 4ms response time. It doesn't make much of a difference as you can't even tell the difference.In a nutshell,+144hz+4ms+freesync+VA panel+curved monitor (new but great experience)+great colors compared to TN"
4,"So for those wondering about 1080p 144hz on hdmi ( u can get it but this monitor doesnt allow) so to get 144hz on hdmi go to nvidia control panel setup custom resolution change it to 144hz ,and change the dropdown menu to manual and u can run 144hz on hdmi because theoretically hdmi should support 144hz .THIS MAY VOID WARRANTY(I AM NOT SURE) SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK . And enjoy 144hz on hdmi laptop users.So , about backlight bleed i didn't have any backlight bleed i got very good panel and colors looks good but black looks weird. OSD controls are very good . If you get bleeding panel or some defects replace it worth it for the money. In just got it today so i cant say anything about longevity."

4,"PROS1) 144 Hz. (not adaptive) (constant)2) Curved 1800.3) Good brightness.4) Has separate headphone jack.CONS1) Has an adapter.2) VA panel, so colours are not good.3) In box cables give out static to GFX card (sometimes).4) Only 1 joystick in the back, no separate on/off button.5) Top and sides 1 cm bezels, not good for matrix display.6) 4 ms displayGOOD for beginner gamersCan go for 165 hz 1ms display"
5,"I have been using this curved monitor for a sometime now.THOUGHTS: Keep in mind that the product is targeted to budget consumers so do not expect to perform like an expensive monitor.COLOR/ACCURACY: It's a VA panel with 4ms of response. Acceptable for its price. Brightness and color accuracy is good but little inferior to msi or samsung monitors that I have used in the past. All within acceptable range.Custom profiles can be set to users liking.REFRESH RATE: Through hdmi upto 120hz output is available at 1080p. Refresh rate also varies on the version of hdmi cable being used (hdmi 1.0 or 2.0). Through display cable upto 144hz is available at 1080p.MONITOR TECHNOLOGY (FREESYNC & GSYNC): Yes it's a free-sync monitor and will work with all AMD cards. It works with gsync too. However there is one minor concern that can be easily ignored (not to be confused with a defect). When gsync is on, I observed faint screen flickering when using cinebench or gigabyte's system information viewer (to control fan speed/temperature). Only the black, grey and white areas of the screen would flicker as long as the programs are kept open on desktop. Your mileage may vary.SOLUTION: Turning off such programs or minimizing them will stop the flickering till you open the mentioned programs again. If you wish no flickering at all turning off gsync (from nvidia control panel) would solve it completely. Again It's not a defect. The VA panel used in the monitor has not been validated by nvidia to be used with gsync (as mentioned in nvidia control panel). For more information check out videos available in youtube. Nvidia is aware of this and has already addressed it in 2019. No flickering observed when playing games or using daily programs or watching movies/videos with gsync on.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING: Some users complained of receiving units with backlight bleeding. It's not a manufacturing defect...not necessarily. Sometimes a design flaw can also be the cause. It all depends on the manufacturing standards how they want to channel the light on screen with minimal leakage to the sides reducing bleeding effect. Mine works just fine.Overall a good product to be used as a daily driver."
5,"Best VFM 32 inch 1440p 144hz VA panel on the market, atleast in the Indian market that is. Nothing of equal spec monitor can be had for below 50k. Better alternatives maybe had for even less elsewhere but in India an alternative  monitor like this with similar spec can only be had for around 50k. Certain buyers experiencing horrible backlight bleeding, luckily for me no such case here. no noticeable ghosting either. deep rich black with was not possible with my 24 inch ips display."
1,Pathetic monitor useless.It doesn't let me got into bios. Don't know why really did a mistake buying this really would not recommend it to anyone. First they send a defective piece and not I got a monitor I don't know what the hell is wrong. Seriously I can not my pc into bios from my old monitor but not from this

4,Good monitor.. one less star for one stuck pixel
1,"Heavy Backlight bleeding, it's very irritating to use monitor for low light pictures,games,movies..."
5,"I am using this for office work at home and to watch videos sometimes.  This is perfect, the concave screen is awesome.  The best part it has all types of ports to connect.  I am using DVI now.  U can also mount it on the wall if required, the stand is very stable and takes minimal space of ur table."
5,This monitor is a treasure left in open to be explored !!Initially I was not impressed by either the picture quality or gaming performance.But as I explored and played with settings !I can say for certain that this is the best all round 1080p monitor in market right now !!!1. For fps gaming turn pixel overdrive to extreme.2. For best picture/text clarity turn off pixel overdrive and set colours to normal.3. For super sharp movie content like 1080p /2k/4k content follow these settings:  ->Do things in step 2 and follow rest from below.....  a> turn contrast to 60.  b> balck boost to 5.  c> turn on super sharpness.  d> use normal colour mode.  e> set brightness to 80%+.  Ezzz best possible experience ever........
4,"I'll keep this sort and simple. I'm not a tech reviewer, so I can't go into depth regarding blacks and nits, and other nitty gritty details a lot of you may be looking for. But I have been gaming for nearly two decades now, and this monitor is a freaking game changer.Set up was pretty easy, and apart from the display port cable that did not work out of the box, I had no issues setting this one up. However if like me, you do have to connect this monitor to an HDMI cable, set the refresh rate in your games to 120hz and NOT 144hz till you get a proper DP cable. My monitor kept losing temporary signal to my games till I dropped my refresh rate to 120.I've also never used a curved monitor before and was a bit apprehensive, but I was sold the minute I booted this one up. If anything, I started wondering how I've gamed on a non-curved monitor all my life.To test this monitor out, I ran the usual suspects like Doom Eternal and COD: MW, and they performed really well. Doom Eternal felt like a new freaking game and impressed me the most. I even tried out Division 2 and holy crap, that game looks mind blowing - especially during the night in New York. Finally, I loaded up some Forza Horizon 4 and didn't expect a higher refresh rate to really wow me, but damn, was I wrong. Racing through England's country side never felt better.Like many of you, I was on the fence for this monitor since I haven't read any credible reviews, but after spending a whole day with this monitor, I'm very happy so far. Guys I know have told me to hold off judgement for at least a month or so, so I guess I'll report back then. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this purchase."
3,"There is heavy back-light bleeding all across the edges and cornersViewing angles are poor. Image quality is ok at 60Hz with a lot of tuning of image settings.At 120Hz it seems to switch to a TFT display mode and the colors are really bad.If you are looking for a budget display just for gaming, then this will do the job. Otherwise it is a waste of money...spend 30-40% more and get a better displayUpdate : Feb 2021Displays are just dumb mirrors of GPUs. After switching from gtx750Ti to rtx3070 and switching from an old hdmi cable to display port, I am able to get the maximum promised performance (144Hz@2K). Previously I used to get max 120Hz@1K and 60Hz@2K. Image quality is significantly better now with the 3070 card."
5,"Was very skeptical to get this due to the range of negative reviews, but after lots of research decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (although my expectations were minimal due to the price). As usual Amazon's delivery was fast, got it with 10% discount for 11.7k. This is undoubtedly the best <20k 144Hz Curved Monitor, nothing comes close with all aspects considered. For the price you pay, you are getting an above average monitor which is simply scintillating (assuming you can get past minimal issues which do not affect your everyday use)"
5,"144 hz, 3-4 ms, free sync (compatible with both nvidia and amd), 27inch curve, va panel all these things approx 20000 rupees. No dead pixel spotted yet. Might be best budget monitor for students or games. My personal rating arePicture 10/9 (due to va panels)Response time 10/10Input lag 10/8Brightness 10/7Value for money 10/8 ( indian sellers sold their goods at higher prices compared with international sellers)Refresh rate 10/10Free sync 10/10 ( i have 1060 and it still working as gsync monitor)Note - light bleeding is an issue  - acer provide it’s warrantyBest alternative- samsung cfg73 model, asus vg279q (alltho these high in price)"
5,"Absolute worth every penny....this is the best budget gaming monitor you'll find....the smoothness of 144hz is something you will feel once you start working on it....i myself has switched from a 60hz panel to this and literally it feels like the difference of day and night....everything is just amazing, the picture quality, the brightness levels and the size is also prefect for almost everyone....the gaming experience is also great, if you have good pc specs capable of handling the latest AAA titles then you will get to know the real level of a 144hz panel....trust me the graphics look absolutely stunning on this monitor....The only thing i feel that needs a little bit of improvement is the level of the bezels, they somewhat are on a thicker side which is however not a big problem for me but it would've been great if they were a little less thicker...but overall everything is just top notch....Totally satisfied with the deal....🔥🔥"
5,"I was sceptical about buying this monitor. As I read lots of bad reviews about dead pixels and screen quality issues. After lot’s of research i come down to three options aopen, lg ips with 75mhz refresh rate and Samsung curved quantum dot. Lg is cheapest one but it t has lots of bad reviews and has only 75mhz refresh rate that I don’t think as upgrade. Samsung one is too costly so decided to buy this. I m not sure but aopen and Samsung using same panels or screen technology . Brought this on diwali sale and wait for 20days too see if i come across any issues mentioned in other reviews. And i m glad that device is working fine. There are minor blacklight bleed but its not noticeable. As this one is not IPS panels is was worried about colour vividness. But when i test some YouTube video on this monitor i was impressed with its wide range or colour . Curve features of this monitor but is bit useless for at least 24” I guess if u buy 32inch screen it may feel more immersive with curve. Overall i can say product is good and definitely recommended."
4,Overall a good monitor for the price.Mine has one dead pixel but works great otherwise.
2,"This monitor is good only to watch HD videos and 2k videos or movies in a curved display. Will not recommend it for Gaming.I am using AMD 3600, GTX 1660, 16GB Ram, turned ON free sync and linked with G-sync as Nvidia started support all the adaptive displays. But game flickers a lot, if you have a AMD GPU you can give a try but you need also consider the backlight bleeding out of the box and black uniformity is not good. If you are watching dark scenes, it's messing up. I returned the product. You can check for Samsung 24 inch 144hz curved monitor on same price range or LG 24 Flat 144hz for same price."
3,"To start, this is the one of the best gaming monitor, response times at 60hz and 170hz are excellent no ghosting and overshoot if you choose 'picture quality' mode.This monitor has a huge issue, that's BGR sub pixel layout, which makes text so blurry which hurt your eyes. Windows cleartext helps but there are many program which does not support cleartext as a result text appears blurry, especially in grey background, which is also know as dark mode.My friend and I bought this monitor and we both experienced dead pixels and weird yellow light bleeding from both bottom ends, we replaced them and observed similar yellow light in replacement models too. People on reddit are also talking about this issue. You can refer to the images. Gigabyte's Quality control seems to be very bad or they are knowingly shipping these faulty units in India. All of the units were manufactured in Nov 2020. Why are they selling 8+ months old products? Something does not seems right here .As like most of the users I want monitor not only for gaming but for normal browsing, office work (9 hours a day), watching web/TV series and movies. So I can't compromise on such basic things after paying 33k. I refunded the monitor at the end and went for MSI Optix MAG274QRF."
4,Super For PriceWas thinking to get LG 650F but got this because of more features & more colours.It has decent amount of IPS Glow & backlight issue but it is expected in every IPS display. Which makes a bit annoying if you are watching movies in dark room.Display is a little bit warm colour (same as LG) side but looks normal after shifting it to Cool settings.Goood for gaming. Seems a huge difference to me shifting from 60hz monitor.There's no such text reading issue felt as many people claims for every 27inch 1080p monitor. Everything seems crispy & sharp.It has a big plug ( like refrigerator ) so you might need adapter to power on which costs me 50₹ in nearby electrical store.It was a tough decision to buy this as a first buyer but Overall worth the money go for it.
5,"I was a bit skeptical before buying a gigabyte monitor. Checked on few youtube videos and came to know this monitor has all the specs for my needs. The only drawback is this is a 1080p monitor if someone is looking for an upgrade to 2K or 4K but there is a higher model which is 2K so there is an option, anyway, coming back to this one, What I loved about the monitor is the color. The color is amazing on this one. Any content you watch like movies, series, youtube, everything just looks amazing on this one. Playing games on this monitor is another charm as it's a 144 hz monitor. I'm using an RTX 2070 and games run ultra-smooth even if I limit my fps to 60. Definetly would recommend this monitor to someone looking for a gaming monitor at this range. Won't regret one bit after using it."
1,LED light leak. See the picture attached.
4,This was the only curved screen monitor in va panel with a such great response time colours were too good compared to samsung va curved monitor this aorus monitor is best in every possible way no pixel streching good for gaming and movie the only problem i had was dead pixel i got monitor with 1 or 2dead pixel so i returned the monitor the price of this monitor on Amazon is expensive site if u find i offline or from mdcomputers or vedant computer they sell this beast around 32000rs i have rated 4star because of its price on amazon
5,I have gaming setup capable for 2k gaming. I had full HD LG monitor. That good for casual gaming but it's have lot of bad effect on eye. So I decided for new gaming monitor. I searched alot more then 3month my budget was around 33k.after saw reviews of many monitor and doing my won research I filter out 3 monitor.1- asus tuf vg27aql1a2- Benq-ex2780q3- Gigabyte m27qI send lot of query on professional monitor tech reviewers (mostly out of India) and each and everyone suggest for this monitor under my price range.I'm writing this review after using 30 days..Pro-2k 175hz fast ips pannalApprox 93% pci3 colorVESA certified hdr400It's freesync also support G-SYNC (I'm using rtx3070)Good out of box color calibrationMultiple inputs monitor has HDMI DisplayPort usb-d type 2usb port 1 usb type CMost important it's has built in KVM switch. I do my office work and gaming on same desk setup by using kvm i have connected my office laptop with monitor type c cable and can control both the screen by single keyboard and monitor. And only one press of button i switch between my personal pc to my office laptop (with big 27inch display) this is most awesome feature this monitor has.ConsOnly one overdrive features is good other 2 are not fastColors are more green side and little oversaturated but that can easy to change as per your convenienceIf you are moving to full HD to 2k this will be the best monitor you will see the great difference in viewing and gaming.Chek harware unboxed review on youtube.
4,"I was one of the first customers to buy this monitor, there weren't any reviews back then but since I purchased I thought I might help a few other people.This is a great monitor for this price range.... It delivers clear image and didn't face any major backlight bleeding issue it's an IPS display so backlight bleeding is anyways expected.... Picture quality is crisp for a 27 inch 1080p monitor,and text look sharp.... I use it for coding and playing high fps games like valorant, csgo, apex legends etc. The exprience is good if your laptop is having hdmi or display port connected to your cpu ... I have a rtx 2070 in my laptop and my hdmi and display ports are connected to GPU so sometimes you get unstable fps and flickering. I tried to connecting my brothers laptop with GTX 1050 and his laptop has hdmi and mini display port connected to cpu and noticed no flickering or fps shutter.... It has a volume control option which got me confused if this monitor comes with a speaker but I think that is for the aux port provided at the back of the monitor. Overall it's a good monitor if you're looking for productivity and gaming at this price point you can go for it. But if you have a nvidea graphic card there is a similar priced monitor from lg with g sync you can try that maybe that might not get this shuttering issue.Some images are not that good because of phone camera issue please ignore"
4,I am using this monitor as an extended screen most of the time. The quality of this panel is really very good. I didn't find any dead pixel anywhere on screen. In fact this monitor is heavy than I thought. So you can imagine the build quality.Honestly speaking full HD resolution is not enough for 27 inch monitor. Pixels are visible specifically when you are watching any text content on website or anywhere else on this monitor. If your eyes are pixel sensitive then it will irritate you in between (Better you go with QHD). By the way while watching video you will have whole different experience. Monitor is capable of showing colors accurately. However not all color settings provide pleasant experience on screen. I am using sRGB which is giving me realistic experience. DPI is very low (I don't know whether all gaming monitors have same specs).Yes you can have 144hz refresh rate even when you are using it as an extended monitor. But somehow I don't realizing much difference apart from smooth movement of mouse.Speakers are useless. Volume is not adequate.You can move screen up and down as well as tilt a bit. I do play game sometime but for Asphalt 9 some how it couldn't go beyond 60hz refresh rate.So that's all about this monitor.
2,"Poor build quality and quality control. Received one monitor with lots of backlight bleed. The replacement monitor had acceptable amount of IPS glow, acceptable backlight bleed, but had dust particles stuck in the screen (could see the particles and their shadow on the screen). The product itself is excellent but the quality control is really poor."
5,Best monitor but one thing I want to tell about this is if you have a lower graphics card like 1050 ti because I have this screen tearing will occur and can’t play high settings in game I usually playAnd you can’t change free sync into g sync  Only if you has  a amd graphics card
5,Amazing monitor. The first monitor i received had issues with backlight and also had signs of used before. Thanks to amazon customer care i asked for replacement and got a new one .This is the best panel in a monitor. Quality of the panel is as good as my sony tv. Colors pop.. amazing picture quality.. Their slight bleed or IPS glow but its not major.Works like a charm with my PS5 as well as in my PC.
3,Great monitor but poor quality controlIf you see any backlight or IPS glow  immediately request for a replacementMy first one had terrible IPS glow send one was much better
5,Poli monitor
3,"This display has bleeding issues on all four corners.They’re not very noticeable when gaming but while watching a movie and you hit a dark scene then bleeding shows up.When it comes to colours,it’s the strong area for this display. Colours are vibrant.HDR is not the best you’ll get but for the price & features this monitor offers I think it’s fine. HDR really does make a difference but you’ll still find over-bright areas in the picture.KVM switch works just as it should be.Brightness- I can say it’s bright enough. But with HDR it gets a lot brighter.For gaming this display is worth checking out.144Hz refreshrate is smooth af.But when you look at overall picture quality they’re are better monitors offering better picture quality at the cost of some features."
4,Overall a good product but there's backlight bleeding. It's noticeable while watching movies or black screen but cannot notice while gaming.
5,You’ll get 1080p resolution with 120hz connected via XSX or PS5 do not have HDR support very less bezels decent speakers and no tilt adjustment
5,I think I didn't make wrong choice comparing to Samsung 32 inch monitor. Sharpness is well and very handy in multiple data analysis. Gaming still need to try :) but believe it would perform very well.
5,"There is no reflection , beautiful colours displayed, monitor is hight adjustable and easy to use"
3,"Its having BGR Subpixel layout, which makes text a kind of blury. Not recommended for office work and browsing. Windows clear type text and 120% scaling might help a little but chrome or many browsers doesn't support ClearType Text"
5,Reviewing after 1 month and I tell that this is a great Monitor for all thing it is all rounder 🤩 good performance and brightness also good 👌 Go for it is nice value for money.
5,I love it
5,Buy without hesitation
5,Loving it
5,Best monitor for gamers .. the hd quality is awesome
1,Got 3 dead pixels 😖
5,"Absolute beast of a monitor. The color reproduction is almost spot on, the viewing angles are as good as a high end IPS display. And OH MY GOD the 165hz refresh rate is as smooth as butter. And oh boy it only gets better with the insanely curved 1500R display. Great I/O options for ease of use in any scenario. The only thing that was not upto par was the RGB lighting at the back, it needs to be brighter. This monitor is outstanding."
3,The monitor is available at 27-29k in offline stores. And let me tell it's an FHD screen at 27 inch.... (Super Pixelated screen) and the price OMFG.... 😂And let me Tell you if u r going to buy this product Just for hdr... Then please don't buy it.... Because it is offering you hdr but it's not like the true hdr experience (local zone dimming is not there)Image quality is good but pixelation ruins everything...!!! 😬And if you want a 27 Inch panel then please go with QHD resolution (1440p)Check out the LG 27GN850-B (The best monitor for gamers) available at 35k (bang for buck) ✨😎
5,In the price range this the best Display you can haveHave been using it for more than 2 months and it has fully satisfied me till now
5,"Best monitor for 1440p Gaming and editing because it comes with ips pannel and good Refresh rate , If you are looking for good monitor for gaming or editing just go for it"
5,"Pros:-400+ nits brightness165 hz refresh rategood osd featuresSuperb built qualityEasy Adjustments3 yrs warrantyCons:-No local dimming/ high black levels (can be adjusted by changing the settings)if you’re coming from 4k, you may feel pixalated screen..as typically the rule is 24’’ for 1080p , 27” for 2k and above 4k for above 32”..Neverthless a great monitor for 25k bucks if you order from mdcomputers/ offline stores.."
5,"First of all, 27 is huge! For a display to work and casual gaming, it's great. In second image you can see it's brightness spreading colours over controller(Very well satisfied with that). There's a problem which is unnoticeable, start two pixels from top left corner are either dead or not there, it can be seen in third image.  It's a 2K monitor so anything less than 720p is indigestible. Yes it does scaling, max available resolution at 4K 60fps to lowest 720p. VRR is supported but PS5 doesn't support yet so can't use it right now. It has OSD but needs USB connected(I thought it would work with Thunderbolt cable). Also you can't charge laptops by type c. I would like to add another point, by just one USB type c cable, we can connect keyboard, mouse, speaker (audio jack) to display and it works! Works like a dock!Amazon packaging was perfect and safe for display."
1,"Hi Team,I have recently bought an Acer31.5 inch monitor (ED322Q). I am facing a lot of backlight bleeding issues. While watching a movie or when the screen is black, I could see a lot of background light noise. I have attached a picture also for your reference.I would like to request you to please raise a replacement request as my entire work is dependent on this monitor currently. On amazon there is no replacement policy, all I could see is a return option. However, I would not like to return this product at the moment. It would be nice if you can replace the monitor with a new one and do proper quality control before sending a replacement."
1,"for colors and audio, monitor is use less, only you can enjoy big screen, dont waste your bucks, better buy a good products with extra money, I am asking for replacement. amazon is trying to refund money. When it shipped with out display cable means, some used it rejected the peice. It was sent. Recently one of my frnd order this product. It was shipped with white hdmi cable. It for office purpose and we are using it. If the price is below 17000, I am going to buy again, I missed when the price dropped to 16399"
5,"Looks great, sleek design. Curve is great, just the right amount. Nothing this big(32 inches) for this price.Using it for programming and browsing mainly."
5,Excellent product with excellent packagingSuperb picture quality
5,Video Player is loading.
2,"first of all the monitor that i received was not 75Hz it was 60Hz, there was screen bleed and all the stands and wires seemed used and not new. i ignored the stand and wires but the monitor itself did not work properly, no option for return so placed a replacement"
5,"Got it for 14999. What else can i ask for a 32 inch curved monitor which is almost bezel less and having a beautiful stand. Using it for around 3 weeks. There are various pre adjusted colour modes to suit your eyes in any condition. Have all necessary ports in the monitor, i.e. vga port, dvi port, hdmi port, audio port. As it is a 60-75hz monitor, it is not meant for high end real time gaming.I will update my review later if anything bad happens to the monitor, for now it is working flawlessly and a pleasure to the eyes."
3,"Not good for 1080p resolution monitor. Text are cracky and very bad.Images, videos, pictures are super excellent. Good for HD video. Not text or programing as a monitor.Design is excellent.The in built speaker is so low, hardly audible."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,Awesome.. I don't have any issue with this one.. I recommended. This is budget monitor for Editing and gaming
5,Was looking to buy a TV when I came across this acer monitor and I changed my mind. 16000/- for a 32 inch curved monitor seemed a very good deal as no other monitor could match the price for this size. I don’t know how good or bad is this for gaming as I am not into gaming nor how good the colour scheme is when compared to others or if it’s good for programming. My sole purpose was to watch movies and videos and that is serves amazingly well. The picture quality is fantastic and the curvature of the screen gives a very good feel while watching movies. Never heard it’s sound as I connect my cpu to 2 tower speakers bought separately again from Amazon. Watching movies is now a very awesome experience. Delivery was very prompt thanks to amazon and the product looks very elegant and sturdy. Its sleek design adds to the aesthetics of my room and I am absolutely pleased by its performance. A product worth every penny spent on it!!
5,I saw multiple comments complaining about backlight bleeding. Indeed its correct but don’t expect a 15k monitor that too a curved one with 32 inch size to have all the feature n quality of 60-70k monitor. I purchased it for office work and its serving its purpose perfectly fine. The only shortcoming which could have been avoided by the manufacturer was to give provision for wall mount. Though you can still make it wall mount through aftermarket VESA bracket however you will have to shell out another 4-5k which do not make much sense.
5,Very nice curved monitor and I bought two. When compared to Samsung curved 27 inch it's price is less than 4000 to 5000 bucks. I think its stand looks better than Samsung stand. Initially I was going to buy Samsung but coincidentally reached acer and it was a good decision.
1,Worst part of the product is that it is not very good in pressure distribution at all part of the screen. Due to it curve nature it is having more pressure at the middle . If you are lucky yours may withstand that pressure for longelonger in my case display cracked within 2 months. Also if that happens you won't get any help from customer service.
4,"After using it for nearly a month I can say that this is one of the best curved monitors available at this price, it comes with a warranty of 3 years, looks r amazing and picture quality is good, something of this size and looks at this price has really amazed me. That said, didn’t give it full 5 star because it has slight back light bleeding issue, believe me u won’t notice it while u r watching anything, it is noticeable when the screen is pitch black. Also, the speakers r just alright. Since I needed this monitor to connect my laptop and do my office work, I find it really great"
5,"This monitor with curve screen look beautiful, colours are good for gaming watching Full HD video, I have 2 gb graphics card so picture look more clear and accurate. Best curve monitor at this price range."
5,"It is a piece of art. Exceptional build quality, curvey white and silver beauty.Got it for work/programming, and seems to be perfect. Initially had some issue adjusting to the monster of a screen(my previous moniter was just 20inch) and slight pixilation that comes with big non 4k screens.The default setting is soft and comfortable to the eyes. Perfect for my purpose.Got it with all sort of connectivity cables like HDMI, VGA, 3.5mm(audio only, no mic). The moniter also has two 3.5 mm ports for audio and mic in case you want to plugin a headphone when using HDMI.Highly recommended for programing and regular office work.Note- The inbuild speakers are probably useless, very low volume."
3,"The Product Spec says its 75Hz refresh rate, but it actually 60Hz only. Its the wrong info. conveyed to Customers from ACER itself. I checked in official ACER site itself, where it says this ACER ED273 Monitor is 75Hz but actually when we see the settings of the Monitor, it says clearly as 60Hz only.  For 60Hz monitor, spending 15K is little costlier only. My advice is that if anyone is ok with 60Hz then go for it.Eventhough its 60Hz, I dont see any issue/lag though am using it for my Office work purpose. Haven't tried with Gaming. Overall, Product is good but only disappointing point is that its 60Hz ONLY but where it says 75Hz."
4,"This is a very decent monitor within this price range, got on offer for 14299This monitor is basically for daily use and not high end video editing. The screen is big and you have to adjust the mode (if you go very close to the screen you can see the text is breaking since it is 1080p only and has 32 inch screen) to sit near to it to work especially if you are coding or writing a ms word file. The video quality is also good for watching movies. This also has speakers which has very minimalist sound ( ok if fan is off ). I recommend this monitor to those who wants a big screen to just do daily activities"
4,"Picture quality is good, you can adjust the screen mode with custome and some preset modes like movie, read, user,dark room etc... which basically adjust the brightness and the blue light settings. The curve will be less when you go for smaller sized screen amd slightly better when you go for more sized screen. which is expected behaviour.Only 1 drawback i feel is the sound quality of the screen inbuilt speaker..!! the vol is very low even if you set to max vol, u might need an external speaker for better audio ( i tested it only with hdmi cable and in hdmi cable soind comes default to the screen with out the aux connection. this is the 1st day impression will update the feedback after few more days"
4,"I got this for 14.2K (inclusive of bank discount) and would say this is a steal deal !75Hz (atleast as read by my pc) , curved, FHD and 32"" at this price is fabulous.Also in box you get-power cord (and adaptor)-hdmi cable-vga cable-DVI cableAs read here, people see dead pixels,i'll be monitoring this issue and update the review if I face any.Conclusively, am pretty happy with this purchase.Cons : The screen bleeding issue is true...you would see bleeding on a blank screen"
1,"Its just been 12 or 15 days and the monitor is having flickering pixels.On a particular color or maybe a specific range of colors, a shade of grey, there are flickering purple pixels, hundreds of pixels are illuminating as another color, purple...Also, its not my Computer that is not working properly, i tries taking screenshots when this was happening and then sent the screenshots to other devices to see if the pixels are in that picture too, but its not, the screenshot is clear with none purple pixels.Lemme tell you, don't buy this monitor seeing the price, go for a samsung one, i made a mistake!!"
1,guys dont buy this monitordisplay stopped working within 3 months  and got trapped nownon of the acer centres accepting it alsoand no seller details
2,Amazon misleading customers with a fakd description as it states free sync but actually its not what they shown. Secondly the refresh rate is 60 hz but it shows 144 hz. So gamers don't buy this you will get sick of screen tearing.
4,"The monitor works like a charm, the screen is huge and it has good picture and audio quality. Sure the speakers aren't big enough for a large room but that can be fixed with external speakers. HDMI, DVI, VGA, and everything else as written in the product details.The resolution isn't high enough, if you notice closely, the picture will be pixellated. I would suggest you go with a 4K resolution if you're going for this size, but unfortunately none of them are this cheap.The curve is good, build quality is nice, just go for it :)"
1,Its been 1 month and display is dead ..applied for warranty. Will see their service too  ..Not recommended by me for sure ..
5,Working smoothly with gtx 1650
1,This monitor completely sucks. The colour balance is horrible. The screen looks like it’s from the 1990s. I literally got transported back to my mother’s womb and experienced in real time what monitor screens felt like 30 years ago.Don’t waste your money on this product. Absolute waste of a product and Amazon did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to fix this. They are happy selling bad products and provide no return to dissatisfied customers
1,Good monitor but power on and off a major concernafter 1 yr big black line in the monitor unable to use
5,This is my first 1080p monitor so consider review accordingly.For first impressions I thought this is a way to big monitor and was going to trade it for a smaller one. But believe me in just a few hours of usage it became the perfect sized monitor. Text is crisp if you don't sit too close which you should not considering the size. The curve makes a noticeable difference. Overall the purchase is good as per price range. You cannot complain about speakers considering the price.
1,There is a DEAD PIXEL within 1 month of buying this product. Please check the photo I attached. it's small but it is noticeable. Tomorrow moght happen there may be dozens of dead pixels appear.I want a REPLACEMENT for the product from Acer. The product is obviously under warranty.
2,"Screen is too big and 1080p is not at all working for this size. It's good for watching movies or youtube videos. You buy big size monitor so that you can use multiple windows side by side but everything is so streched that it feels like using TV as monitor.Will not recommend it at all until you just want to watch movies and do Netflix. Selling 32 inch monitor at this price point is commendable but not worth it, instead go for Acer 24 inch monitor."
5,Really the best monitor 20ks can buy. I would definitely recommend buying this.The color tones are just perfect for daily computing. Deliver days could have been better.
5,"great buy at the price... doesnt have auto brightness adjustmentalso, the speakers are useless... could have been positioned at the front if possible but that may have impacted sleekness of form"
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"Display issue....second hand product there are few dots available....finish is not good...I bought for  15000 over-priced u can go for flat monitor and a brands like hp, dell or asus"
4,"Best product if you getting near 15k,as per me there is only brightness adjustment showing error it going high so difficult long time watch in dim light or dark room, on and off botton personally i dont like because if you move its in closing time its go to program and features. There than this you can definitely go for it."
1,"When I opened the box, the screen was damaged / the display had fluid accumulated in one side of the curve. Manufacturer/seller shall do minimum quality check before dispatching when this many customer reported complaints."
4,"This is a really good monitor for work. I would happily give 5 stars to this monitor but here are two reasons :1) Sounds quality is not good as i expected2) I received monitor on 29th August and Bought it for ₹17,499 but at the same day I checked price and it was ₹14,499.If you want to work or want something for entertainment then just go for this one!"
5,I got it at 14399 in offer and this is a very beautiful monitor with great picture quality and premium qualityThanx to acer for making such a beautiful and huge monitor in such a cheap price.If it would have a IPS panelThen it would be a lit 🔥Attraction Magnet Design 🔥
3,I wanted a crisp display as a programmer. There are a lot of good things about this monitor.The display is amazing. The ports are more than sufficient. It has a stable hinge with adjustable height and tilt.The one thing that is not documented anywhere is that it that quadHD / 2k displays don't play well with macOS. You need at least a 4k display ( 5k if you can afford it to match the retina standards your eyes get used to while working on a macbook pro ). The text/font on macOS looks super blurry and hard to read. I tried everything under the sun to fix it but to no avail. I have sore eyes with just a week of usage. Asked amazon to return so that I can get a 4k monitor.It will probably work better with windows but i suggest not buying this one if you are a mac user.
3,"Amazon's delivery is on time as always. Kudos for fulfiling wishes before time.Coming to the monitor, it feels premium and the picture quality is just exceptional.But the model i received is faulty, it has serious colour bleeding issues on top left and bottom left corners. It doesn't display true black and the bleeding is very annoying if the picture is black and dark colours.In short :Pros,1. The stand is just amazing. Movement is fluid.2. Colours are great.3. Editing in this one is treat to eyes.Cons,1. NOT FOR GAMMING.2. Suffers from serious colour bleeding issue.3. Bezels are outdated in 2020."
4,"**update october 2020 after one year of use**I have been using this everyday for 12-14 hours and no issues. No color bleed or light bleed, no new dead pixels or bright ones. Seems like a product built to last.******good monitor for editing and movies, casual gaming but beware of low response times. some ghosting in fast games...and sure its still good if you play 1-2 hours a day, for RTS games its beautiful. colors are great, well built and nice stand, 10 bit panel quality and brightness is good. beware of 1 or 2 dead pixels. i got mine exchanged due to too many dead pixels. replacement is ok. and hey the speakers are good for only windows sounds and a little noise. the stand is great and u dont need 4k monitor in 27 inch as density becomes irrelevant beyond this level. for 32 inch go for 4k. 27 covers a lot of desk space."
4,"The monitor itself is top-notch with all the features and cables that one could require for a professional workflow.If you are considering this, you might most probably be comparing it to the BenQ BL2420PT. The main differences between the two are as follows:1. This comes with HDMI cables in the box.2. This one is 27"" as compared to 23.8"" of the BL2420PT.3. This one has a panel bit depth of 10 bits (8 bits + FRC) which isn't true 10 bit display. The BL2420PT comes with a 8 bits display.4. The number of ports on this monitor (PD2700Q) is lesser than that of the BL2420PT.  The BL2420PT has an additional 3.5mm Audio In port and a DVI-D Dual Link connectivity.5. The display area on this is 82.45% as compared to 81.85% on the BL2420PT.6. The BL2420PT has a light-sensor built into it for the monitor to adapt to the ambient lighting. So if that matters to you, the PD2700Q is probably not the one you should go for.Having stated the differences between the BL2420PT and the PD2700Q, there seems to be no obvious winner. Depending on your preferences and needs, either will serve the purposes of photo and video editing, and other content creation better than any other monitors within the sub-26000 category.All in all, if you don't necessarily require a 27"" monitor, going for the less expensive BL2420PT is not a bad option since the differences are minimal at best. Depending on your desk space, the BL2420PT might even be a better fit for your setup.Personal Experience:Unfortunately, I received an unit with a dead pixel. At this price range, a display with a dead pixel is unacceptable, and the Quality Check of BenQ has to be improved.I have applied for a refund, and cannot order the same monitor since it is out of stock as of the time of writing. Will purchase the cheaper version (BL2420PT), perhaps.Edit: I applied for refund on the 12th of July. Nobody has come to pick up the Monitor til now (20th July). Picked up on 22nd July after contacting Customer Rep. on 21st. Amazon Customer service is prompt. Highly appreciated.Received refund on 24th. Good service by Amazon."
5,Best thing I have bought after a macbook for my setup. Dream come true for coders. Perfect 2k monitor fits a text editor and a small browser and a terminal screen if you need so. Works perfectly with macbook. Color reproduction is perfect. No light reflection. I am able to work in a perfect daylight. Vertical setup for log monitoring and what not. This is the one monitor you need. You dont need a wide angle monitor for coding. This monitor is big enough
5,"TLDRPerfect for professionals and semi professionals on a budget who exclusively make content for the web. Though it comes factory calibrated, the calibration isn't too accurate (according to my SpyderX pro but after calibration it's just perfect. The factory calibrated white point and gamma are spot on, therefore your calibration tool wouldn’t have to create an aggressive correction profile, therefore yielding very accurate colors.BUILDMostly plastic but feels solid. Anti glare finish on the panel works quite well while keeping the viewing angles excellent. Has enough IO to satisfy most except type C or USB 3 passthrough.COLOR REPRODUCTIONFrom factory it comes calibrated with a calibration report but since colors shift overtime, recalibration is of course recommended. I calibrated as soon as I received my display to gamma 2.2 and white point at 6500k (with the display set to sRGB profile). There was quite a difference in the colors but the white point and gamma remained pretty much unchanged. From factory (according to BenQ) the display may have an average ∆E of upto 3, which is not ideal, so it wasn’t surprising to see a fairly big change in the colors after my calibration. It does indeed cover very slightly over the sRGB gamut and that’s a good thing. The max brightness advertised is 350nits but with my testings I only got 336nits at 100% brightness.As for backlight bleed and dead pixels etc., there’s nothing major. My unit doesn’t have any dead pixels but does suffer from a minor backlight bleeding issue but it’s perfectly normal at the price point. Even some very high end displays that don’t have full array backlights do suffer from backlight bleeding. In any case, the bleed isn’t visible whatsoever in day to day use and can only be noticed when viewing a completely black scene. All in all, nothing to worry about.One issue I did find, however, is that it doesn't support 10bit colors over HDMI. You must use the display port for that. Also windows tends not to switch automatically to 10 bit color in my experience. If you do have display port and you can't choose 10 bit color manually within windows or your graphics driver, you're out of luck. Most of the newer desktop graphics drivers do support 10 bit output. Newer laptops with Nvidia GPUs that support the NVIDIA STUDIO DRIVERS (GTX 10 series cards and up) will be able to utilise the full 10 bit color depth but you'll need to toggle it in the nvidia control panel. HOWEVER, if the laptop main board is hard-wired such that the nvidia GPU doesn't get interface directly with the display, you're out of luck. But that Shouldn't be the case for newer laptops."
4,"Good.FYI,consider below points before you order your display for primary use.  your height  your desk height (in case of fixed)  Monitor vertical height  And the chair which you use (stool chair, or normal office chair)In my case, my height is 5.6 feet, table height is 28.5 inches, monitor vertical height is 19 inches(17+2) its 32"" monitor ,Chair - normal office chair.When I placed the monitor on the desk, the monitor top is above my eye level (the top side of the monitor was at the height of 48 inches) and for me it is above my eye level ( foot on the floor & elbows at 90 degree).. and unknowingly I started tilting my head little up.I normally work for 13-14 hours a day and I started getting the pain at the bottom of the skull where actually the neck tilt happens.."
1,"I'll tell you outright to avoid buying this.TLDR;- QHD resolution is not coming up on MBP13 2019, PS4 Pro, Windows PCs.- 15A giant plug included which means most definitely you need an adapter! I don't know whose idea was it to put this giant plug in a monitor.- No auto input switch! Like even my 2011 monitors had that feature!- Very clumsy OSD- Pros: flexibility in adjustments. A shame it's just a showcase and not practical.UPDATE: Have returned this. I'm pretty sure this monitor could work for some folks but if you're daily driving a Mac, I would recommend doing a thorough research and buying a different monitor. BenQ definitely has some excellent newer models which are worth checking out.I will state that BenQ makes excellent monitors. However, this one is pretty old and will almost likely cause issues for you. I own an MBP 13"" 2019, an aging gaming PC that's capable of driving QHD resolutions and a PS4 Pro. I expected this monitor to work out of the box with all of my devices. I did notice the review about this not supporting Mac but I took that with a grain of salt, thought the reviewer forgot about some tweaks that are usually necessary with QHD monitors.Boy was I wrong. This one was a hot mess right from the moment I got it out. For starters, the plug is a huge one, the one that comes with 15A heavy duty appliances! Why would you include this in a monitor? I had to go buy an adaptor to be able to plug this in.Then I plugged in my Mac. Things were blurry, resolution was locked to 1920*1080. I tried all the tricks in the book to override this and make it work in QHD but failed. I thought fine, maybe I need to go buy a DisplayPort adapter. Maybe.So I thought to myself, ""surely this should work with a Windows PC"". Wrong again! The same scenario, resolution locked to 1920*1080. Nothing in the OSD to change this. Fumbling around got me nowhere. Wasted hours of my day doing this dance.Fine, I thought. Macs have a terrible rep, my PC is old. The PS4 Pro should at least support QHD? You can guess what happened next. It was locked to 1080p—AGAIN!So, there you go. It probably was QHD by the year of release standard but it definitely is not able to do that anymore. The OSD is so not intuitive and you get lost all the time. I couldn't even tweak the hue, color temperature as they were all locked. I reset the monitor settings many times but nada.The OSD is probably one of the most atrocious ones I've seen and I expected it to be very easy for a product of this range. It doesn't even have auto input switch (couldn't find it no matter where I looked!). So there were occassions when I'd turn off and turn device back on and the monitor would just not show anything. I have to manually change the input to something else and back to HDMI to get it to work.All this was quite jarring to me since I thought I owned a more premium BenQ DesignVue product but it was worse than my budget 1080P monitor. I had suggested a different QHD BenQ to my friend during the sale and he's able to use it just fine with his Mac. I was paranoid enough to verify it by asking him for so many proofs.To sum it up, this ain't it. There are better BenQ and other QHD monitors out there. This one is dated (I should've used that as an important criteria) and it'll unlikely work out of the box for you.I'll be going to return this or check to see if I can get a suitable replacement for now."
5,"I bought this for personal use to do day to day browsing and watching some videos. Works as a great entertainment monitor in a 120 SFT room.I do not see any big difference in terms of colour. As i mentioned I am not a professional and hence I may not understand or need colour accuracy. But I liked:a) 100% all direction adjustable stand.b) No irritation to eyes, both in terms of using it for work/leisure as well for video watching.c) Overall appearance of monitor - classic looks coupled with modernity.Worthy for the price."
5,One of the best monitor at this price range. After lots of search I choose this one and I am very happy.It filled my all requirements what I was looking for in a computer monitor.Thanks to Amazon for the awesome product.
5,"The product is very good for the price. Not at par with Dell but Dell is very expensive, Dell sold at more than double the price of BenQ. So, considering the price factor, I am very satisfied with this BenQ monitor. I purchased this monitor at Rs. 25,990/- whereas the same configuration for Dell is priced more than Rs. 56,000/-. So don't expect much at this price range. For the overall common purpose and some graphic works, this monitor is more than enough. Photographers may choose different monitor built specifically for them. Lastly, my sincere thanks to the seller, Amazon and the delivery service for safely delivering the piece during this Covid-19 Pandemic where lock down and containment zones are the common norms."
3,"I tried LG27UL500 and because of bad screen quality of LG, I increased my budget by another 10K and purchased this.BenQ Monitor is good,  very sturdy and good picture quality.  There are very few Picture modes and brightness intelligence technology don't work with all of them.The monitor which I got has a damage on the right bottom where the case is not closed properly a small plastic material is coming out.. I thought this is a damage that has been caused in transit.  so ordered for replacement.2nd BenQ monitor came.  the cap which closes the brightness intelligence sensor has come off, while unpacking! Looked at it and some how I placed it in place. Brightness intelligence sensor working properly.The bottom of the screen has slight red color, and top has slight blue color!!! and also I can see two small dots of lights glowing at the bottom.. With such a flaw how come they call it a Designers' monitor. So costly. 40K!!Its just wast of time.."
1,"BENQ PD3200u 4k UHD Monitor.sole purpose was to have a extended monitor to Work from home.The story this far: Monitor bought on 19-10-2020 was received with damaged pixels.Booked a complaint with BENQ. BENQ did not respond on time. However, Amazon replaced it on 21-10-2020.Unfortunately this replaced monitor too was found to contain damaged pixels and other manufacturing defects/damages like the monitor mount stand metal is full of deep scratches and screw thread portion is unevenly drilled - even a 20 years old metal will not have such damage on the metal.after one day long conversation with amazon for first replacement, i lost the hope of a second replacement with amazon.after booking the second complain with BENQ , still no response they are good at selling scrap parts.despite the monitor features that it has eye care and low light etc. .. it comes with dead pixels and panel airbubles.guys don't waste time with the defects, damages, follow-ups, chaos of explaining and searching  etc.. after spending your hard earned money on a monitor which is approximately INR 69,990/- !!the way i trusted and spent huge money , they don't trust when we say some thing is wrong with the manufacturing or operational issue.it really hurts when every time i look at the monitor."
5,"This piece of Monitor is the best in its class. For the price you pay, this is the best one you get. This comes with the most accurate colour correction scale as compared to any other branded monitors. If you are the one who wants performance over the external looks with value for money then Go-Ahead for this one. For sure there is a noticeable frame around the screen in this model. But if you check Dell or Samsung, you may get the thinnest frame but the price is around 10K more than what BenQ is offering with this model. With 2K QHD this is one of the coolest monitors in the market. For those who believe in ""Talent brings Creativity and not the Good looking or High-Tech Gadgets"" this is the One Hot serving tea. I personally choose ""Performance"" over the outer looks which comes in my Budget."
5,"The Only issue is that i purchased it on 6 Aug 2020. But the warranty is showing from 6 June 2020.No dead pixel. No flickering. No backlight bleeding.The model looks old but sturdy.Overall best monitor under 80k.Note- It has no HDR. It is a professional monitor so it shows real color. So if You wanna buy just for media consumption (watching movies, youtube etc) then you should buy a lower model that comes with HDR, it will be cheaper too due to VA panel.I make youtube videos for Civil Services Examination. Crackers IAS Academy on Youtube.This is the best investment i have ever made on a display."
5,Excellent screen. Very smooth functioning of the tilt and height adjustment. The big screen real estate is very helpful working on multiple windows at the same time. I only wish there was a cable management design integrated too. That would make it very neat package while using too.
5,"One week into using it and I'm feeling good about it. Currently using it with Mac pro, I was circumspect about it having read other reviews regarding its issues with rendering texts with Mac products but I have not experienced any problem.The monitor is sturdy, and has sRGB, darkroom etc options as promised albeit I haven't really explored them enough to comment on them.The one problem that i'm facing currently (which is frustrating) is that if I play full screen videos on Chrome, then the monitor seems to envelop the video with a yellowish tint, and it goes away if the video isn't full size.The issue is seen only with chrome, works fine with Firefox or Safari, so i'm using Fox as a workaround for now and looking into how to fix the chrome issue."
1,No sense of putting money in this I have acer qhd 32inch whose display is better. Within an hour of use its gets heated I have used 10's of displays but none got heated. I have first time seen such heating and i didn't expect these from benq. The button are at back which makes them difficult to operate in triple display setup the cad cam and dual view mode are useless they just change brightness and contrast. Which even I can do by myself the black stabilisers is also useless. Never buy this for pivot or stand those too are useless. Not at all recommended not recommended for autocad or animation users or dual view lovers
1,This monitor has Backlight Bleed and company says Its feature of the product.. I bought this monitor checking reviews where majority has written no backlight bleed or very little only visible in dark room.. but in this monitor its visible in day light too and visible in dark room even in below 50% brightness.
4,"Solid performance on MacBook Pro 13"" mid 2018 Big Sur 11.1. I was afraid the text would be fuzzy however at the right distance the text is clear. Colours were accurate right out of the box. The stand is very sturdy and easy to install. The On screen display menu is easy with tactile buttons. Very pleased with the performance so far.Mainly used with Capture One and Affinity Designer apps."
4,"ProsIPS Display: Accurate color from all viewing angles.Build Quality: Nicely built with a sturdy metal stand and premium material.Color: 10-bit color depth, 100% sRGB, and Rec. 709 for Reference Grade Color.DualView Mode: DualView to showcase designs in two modes (e.g. sRGB and CAD/CAM) side-by-side.Display Rotation: Height, tilt, pivot, stroke, and swivel adjustments.ConsScreen Bezel: The monitor bezel is quite huge and doesn’t look attractive.Display Resolution: It’s not a 4K resolution screen. (For some people it can be an issue)Speaker: The speaker's quality is bad. I recommend using either external or system speakers.Ports & Buttons: It doesn’t have a USB 3.0 port and the button build quality feels cheaper.Gamming: Not at all recommended for gaming as it has a 60Hz display.ConclusionThis monitor is primarily aimed at designers. If you don’t fall into that category, I’ll suggest not to buy this. But if you’re a designer with a limited budget go for it. And for the photographers please take a look at BenQ SW320."
5,"I’ve read in some reviews that this monitor doesn’t work with MacOS. But in my experience of almost a year now, I have always kept it connected to my Macbook on clamshell mode and have never faced an issue. I have set the resolution to 1440p and the colour calibration seems bang on. I am not sure why some people haven’t been able to utilise the maximum resolution. Further, someone mentioned that it comes with a power cable that has a 15A plug but in my case, it was a 5/6A plug. Overall, I am really happy with the purchase and the Rec.709 profile is really good for its deep blacks. Highly recommend it."
5,"I love this monitor for both content streaming and HD video and motion graphics workflows. The 2k resolution means it upscales most HD online content and that can make it look a little hazier then I prefer, but I'd pick this anyday over the much pricier 4k variant. The multiple picture modes are great, and the rec 709 and rgb spaces are quite accurate and useful for online video content production. What I love most is the way it has completely expanded my screen real estate going from a 15 inch Macbook alone. I did have some flicker issues in the first week, but a factory settings reset fixed that."
4,"BenQ PD2700U is good in Picture and built quatity but for long run this moniter is not good. I am using this for last 7 months I have the issue of double image. BenQ after sales service is very bad, take more than 6 month to repair the device. They denied replacement even after they unable to repair it."
5,"This is a one month review. It works very well. No dead pixels or other coloring issues.Colors and Blacks are also rather good. Way better than what you'd expect from a 27"" screen.It has a matte finish. Not glossy.It doesn't have an external power block like most monitors, it's built-in. So, you won't have to spend a lot more on cable management."
5,"At 1440p, 27inch is perfect!! You get a ppi of 108... anything above 95ppi is sharp enough for the human eye... Not for gaming... as refresh rate is 60hertz....Colour  is calibrated, sRGB mode is 100% which will be good for printing digital work..It is an 8bit panel & with FRC reaching 10bit!!! Which is awesome..."
5,"2 weeks of usage and im only getting to love this more.Pros:32 inch - Its big like a beast, especially for somebody who wants to extend a 15inch laptop display. When the box arrived at my home, My family thought i was replacing the living room TV.Stunning good quality pictureMy biggest advantage is the Ergonomics factor. You can use this a vertical display or horizontal.Its got a tilt which does not come by default in many others.DualView and KVM is an advantage no other manufacturer is giving - though I dont have that use case.Cons:Never found anything really until now.  The buttons on the monitor may seem a little old fashioned, but thats really not a con. They well do operate like a charm.The Hotkey Puck for example is a little of the last decade."
5,This is the goto 4K UHD monitor for Designers. My eyes are pretty much adopted to Retina display hence I really wanted something that can match with retina. This is the perfect monitor under 50k! Made for creative people. Love it!
5,This is by far my best monitor for editing photos. The blacks are black & whites looks white. Contrast & color accuracy is very good.Price is very good actually for this type of professional monitor.
5,"I am a hobyist photographer and i needed to invest in a true colour monitor for my workstation. I resrched and found very good review for this one from BenQ. Indeed excellent monitor. You need to have a good enough graphics card to drive this 2K monitor, when i conect my laptop throigh hdmi, the machine lags and performance gets affected. For the monitor, i am completely satisfied with the purchase"
5,Best monitor for video editing. Rec 709 and srgb support. Owsm
5,"I am a professional video editor. And I must say, this is a great monitor. I love it."
3,"Not even able to power on, didn't expect the monitor would come with a 16A plug which won't fit anywhere,  how can we expect to use a heavy duty at office space , it's not an AC or refrigerator,  contacted BenQ customer , they pointed me to regional service center who never picked up the call. If this doesn't get sorted out, I'm end up returning this. I've not been able to  test picture quality yet"
3,"I have upgraded frim dell u2424h fhd ultrasharp monitor, though it is fhd monitor the color and brightness distribution is far better in my Dell u2414h. I have compared these 2 monitors side by side. I am getting option to pay videos with 4k resolution on my dell as i have graphic card in cpu. As we know even we play the same 4k video in fhd that doesnt make any difference. But i dont find any major differences, that could be due to comparing 24 vs 27. So overall, i did not like to spend 40k to get a little difference. If you are upgrading from a premium monitor pls check once again."
1,"Tried to mount it to the Vesa mount, but someone incompetent at their end has tightened up the screws on the back so much that I'm not able to get the screws out. I've WASTED 3 days of my life on 4 screws. Now the screws are stripped. I'm exhausted. Buying from benq is the biggest regret of 2021.Absolute lack of any kind of after sales service. One of my monitors is not usable because of this."
5,Bought it for programming and office work. Used already for couple of days. Overall good experience. Texts are crisp. Build quality is average and mostly expected from one of the cheapest 4k monitors..not sure about the durability at this point.. great experience using it for programming.. plenty of adjustment options to fine tune.. pleasing for eyes..KVM switch is ok and difficult to get it working..built in speaker is waste..
5,"The first device I got was had a black line on the top left.  But when I contacted Amazon customer care and sent the images online they promptly send a replacement which arrived in 3-4 days. After that I have had no issue. The monitor is connected to my Mac and it works fantastically.I would recommend this monitor to all who are into graphics/ UI,UX/ video editing."
5,A very good product for photo editors
5,"Monitor came with sturdy packaging. Excellent overall deal. Calibration testing result document, USB hub cable (similar to printer cable but USB3 speed), HDMI2, display port cables were included. A nice guide to setup and very happy with the result. It also has eye care low blue light mode which we can use for office work/long gaming sessions as well as non image processing workloads. While doing color critial work, sRGB mode for web specific images and REC709 for more color range raw processing is used. If we wish to nitpick, Con is there is no way to know how much Adobe RGB gamut color coverage is there in monitor. Will know from HiRes prints later from dslr."
4,"I received this monitor on 10-Jun-2021. This is a one-day old review. I was looking long for 28""~32"" size monitor for my Photography editing as well as personal work. I finally zero'ed on BenQ. Here are my first impressions:Pros:- Brilliant colours. I am a Ps user and I am aware of colour gamut and correctness. While maybe the SW series may be better, I don't think that with 100% sRGB, this lags behind. I am not a professional photographer, so this monitor is excellent for me. Professionals and ""picky"" people may go for the SW series. The BenQ SW2700PT with 99% Adobe RGB could be better but note that is QHD (1440p) and not UHD (2160p).- I now know that 32"" would have been too big. Even with this 27"", at 1.5' away I have to rotate my head to get full view.- 3840x2160 pixels with exceptional clarity. I observed no backlight bleeding and BenQ Display Pilot software helps me to tune the monitor to my need and the way I work. For example, during normal use, I turn on the ""Reading"" mode that helps in toning down the brightness, etc.Cons: No matter how good, there are always some 'cons':- Expensive- Thick bezel and tad heavy and this affects the next point- The USB and other controls are somewhat inaccessible. It would have been nice if some USB ports were available on the sides. The manufacturer assumes that one will fix all USB cables and there will be no need to add new. To connect new connections (be it USB, HDMI, speakers/headphones, etc.) one has to lay the monitor flat. The monitor is heavy and I have to use a soft pillow to lay it flat. Then I can reach the rear connections. (see pics 2 and 3). This is the greatest drawback.For these 3 points, I have docked off one star.Another small issue. The monitor is shipped with a mains cable having a 15A plug. Cannot understand the reason why for the life of it. the power consumption is just 80W. I had to go and buy a compatible mains cable with a 5A plug and the original is useless for me."
5,"The monitor is perfect for productivity, media consumption and casual gaming. Brightness is more than enough. I'm running it at just 10% brightness as I use it fairly close. Picture is sharp and crisp. While it does support HDCP, it lacks HDCP 2.2. 10 bit color is possible only in 60 Hz. It defaults to 8 bit in 75 Hz, which is a minor con. It is more than enough for 1440p gaming at 60 Hz or 75 Hz. Casual gamers need not worry. It's good enough.  The stand is perfectly functional. The placement of the cable mounts and the buttons are absolutely awful. If you can look past that, just go for it."
4,Good monitor using it from last 1 week with no issue. Picture quality is nice in this segment.The only thing i am missing i can not use wall mount desk mount stand with this monitor as back of this monitor is completely flat an no hook for mounting.Base mount is designed V shape which is leaving extra space behind the monitor. Doesn’t look nice.
5,"This is a value IPS panel (2K @32 INCHES) for the price around 22k to 24k. If you are looking for a decent monitor for productivity and normal gaming, this is a good option. The picture quality is extremely good as it is an IPS panel, though there is little bit of glow in the the edges, bottom right or left, Which again is manageable. The picture quality compensates for this shortcoming, after couple of minutes you completely forget that there is a glow, which is minimal, and only appear in extremely dark scenes. Go for it."
1,"It started malfunctioning only 10 days after delivery, viewsonic wants to provide replacement with refurbished unit, but why should I accept it if I already paid for new unit? Please don't buy it"
1,"Monitor flickers a lot. Not a good product. Service takes lot of time (shared the system details with service team on 4th oct, Still the issue is not fixed). One of the worst product that I ever purchased. One of the worst service that I have ever seen. Don't purchase this product until unless you want to screw yourself."
5,Awesome product. I m very happy to buy this. With lot of research I took it and I must say that this is the best one. Colours are perfect. Design is very premium. Must buy this.
5,Video Player is loading.
4,The monitor is really up to mark. Brightness and pixel quality is really good.. stand could have been better in terms of flexi rotations for adjusting heights and angle.. still 4 star for solving the purpose rightly.
5,"Beautiful display, looks like a work of art! Max brightness could have been slightly higher, but otherwise perfect for 1080p gaming."
5,I use it with my Macbook pro. Colours and calibration are good for a 1080 screen.
3,"its a beauty with brain ,+very slim design +IPS LED panel +27"" size +4ms response timealmost perfect for my need.But very fragile mine broken,asked for replacement of panel to viewsonic , it is 80% of the product."
3,Dislike. Too bright and got eye strain in one week time. I need to adjust the brightness often.
5,So far there is no issue. Do not expect to have one. We have been using Viewsonic produts for many years and their service has been excellent and that is the reason selected this particular model as a monitor for doing photography related work
5,"A piece of art!Shouldn't expect hell lot out of this budget but if expect a monitor with good colors, contrast,and sharpness this is the perfect choice!"
5,Certainty a value For money product and it’s 75hz refresh rate display makes it seem to make it even more worthThe thin edges makes the design look very sleek and nice and fits in any room perfectly.
5,"if only it was 4k, but 2k and response time is great. The picture quality is great and the speaker as expected is below par."
5,Good product with options to change modes and view settings. Screen can also be tilted a bit.
5,The best monitor for its size.. price and specs..Do buy yourself a  really good set of speakers along with this... You won't regret it.
1,Don't buy dont
1,When we use the monitor it turns on and off by itself... every couple of minutes.. Worst monitor stay away from this product
5,Nice product...
3,I am using MacBook Pro 2020. The monitor works perfectly with Windows and Linux But display is blurry with MacBook Pro.
5,"Awesome monitor,  great pacakaging and timely delivery by Amazon.  Love it."
4,Really good value for money product
5,It is a very good monitor.
5,Awesome Monitor ( vx2776 - SMHD27 ) and good delivery by seller. Excellent for gaming and graphics works etc. .
5,Nice
5,Osm product very nice sleem moniter
5,Awesome 👍
5,Good
4,"The colours are great the refresh rate is smooth af.. scores 144 hz on ufo test with hdmi cable too havent  tested on the display cable coz the display cable given in the box doesnt fits on my laptop since most of the laptop have micro display cable you ll need to buy one micro display cable to dp cable adapter.....1080 p on 27 inch doesnt effect much if you are sitting too close to the monitor unless you will see some pixalation but you ll see it in any 27 inch 1080 monitor you buy  and it aint effect much i am a architecture student and i do many graphics related works and its works fine. Gamming is smooth ...preety much everything you need ...go for it . Giving 4 stars because of the display cable, .. the seller should have given a micro display  to dp port cable  too and it didnt have a hdmi cable too in the box i have to use an other hdmi cable for it thats why...rest the performance is nice i ll edit it if i have any problem in future"
5,"This is one of the best monitors I have used. I had benq xl2411 earlier which is a tn panel, this monitor is an ips but gaming performance wise I felt it to be on par with the benq monitor. I had some apprehensions earlier regarding 1080p resolution on 27 inch, but they are no more, the image looks very crisp and the colours makes everything on screen very beautiful. Different modes on the monitor actually help achieve different purposes, fps mode for instance was helpful in playing games like CS GO, where the things were smooth and dark areas visible with fps mode on. Likewise vivid mode brings out some good colours for viewing pleasures when you watch a movie. The HDR mode works, but it only slightly enhance the view over vivid mode.Overall this monitor with its price range is one of the best ones to get if you are into competitive gaming and don't want to compromise on visuals as well."
5,"I actually ordered the lg 24gl600 first but i was skeptical about the tn panel,then i saw this monitor got listed and i quickly cancelled that order and order this one mainly due to ips 144hz and hdr.The product delivered on time and the installation was super easy.Now coming to the monitor,the display is stunning for media consumption. I was worried about the 1080p on a 27 inch might look bad but its not unless u sit really close to the monitor then u can see the pixels.Games like Witcher 3 and Assassin's creed Odyssey  just look stunning.Gsync works great and the hdr option boost the color saturation too much that everything look like Borderlands.The monitor is very bright so i had to set the brightness at 6 . 1ms MBR mode works great but reduces the brightness a bit and i loved the joystick to change the osd settings.Lastly,switching from 60hz to 144 hz is a blessing to a competitive gamer and go for this monitor u won't be disappointed."
5,Has IPS Panel - Has G-Sync & Free Sync (AMD) - 240 Hz - Stand is Strong but the Pivot where the connection is with the Stand & Monitor feels a bit Weak - But its Okay as long as you are turning it 90 Degrees frequently or shaking it. I got it for 29K on Prime Day sale - was Really a Flash Deal - The Monitor is Beautiful - & Attractive - Must buyFor Designers : Please research the color profiles as it differs a little bit from most IPS DisplaysI am using Abode RGB color Profile rather than the generic one provided.
4,"I've had three of these monitors. The second one had massive backlight bleed with 1/3rd of the top looking orange in black scenes. Its replacement has random flickering with Gsync on and it's being returned.All three have noticeable glow in the top right corner with orangish hue in dark scenes.This is a fantastic monitor to have, absolutely amazing if you're coming to a high-refresh display.Some cons that I observed with the monitor:This is NOT a nano-IPS model, which I thought it was due to the branding.This monitor does not have Black Frame Insertion which other 240Hz IPS panels do.The faster overdrive used for ""1ms response time"" marketing is useless.The response time settles with 'fast' overdrive at 4ms and with 'normal' overdrive at 4.5ms( taken from HardwareUnboxed review ) and the difference in clarity between 144Hz and 240Hz is not that noticeable.The stand is a little wobbly.One of the lesser mentioned pro of this monitor is that 'normal' overdrive works well for all refresh rates from 60-240Hz and that's great to have with adaptive sync( Freesync and Gsync ).In hindsight I'd have gone for the 27GL850( 1440p 144Hz ) since I don't see much difference between 144Hz and 240Hz on this monitor and the price difference was around 4k( 31k for this vs. 35k for 27GL850 )."
2,"When i unboxed the product it was really good. When i setup the monitor it looked good but the sharpness was very bad as compared to a 24 inch monitor , Everything feels soft and words are difficult to read . The HDR10 is also bad as expected . The colour calibration is difficult and it does not feel like an ips panel . If u are a gamer then go with a 24inch monitor. The colour accuracy is very bad. This for only those who want to watch movies and some users in office. The sharpness is very bad and freesync cannot be used with mbr. The response time is fine for normal users. If u look closely u can see the pixels. I am returning this monitor cause there is backlight bleeding too and sometimes ghosting. When mbr is on the brightness decreases too. Please only buy if u are on an budget and cannot afford an 1440p 27 inch monitor.I used this monitor with my rx 5700XT"
5,Excellent gaming monitor & great for watching movies too. The pixel density is great and not an issues if u are sitting around 2ft away. Colors are excellent and the responsive times & frame rates are awesome. personally i would have preferred a 32 inch 1440p monitor - 75 to 100hz as i have used a 32 inch Sony bravia for about a year before &i like the screen real estate on that - unfortunately there isnt a 32inch gaming monitor with this kind of a panel and in the budget i was looking for. This is good for a few years and my net purchase would hopefully be an OLED or Micro LED.
4,"Display is best you can get, and can easily compete with even top monitors.But text is another story, text is not as sharp, due to 1080p on 27', in my opinion 1080p is best suited for 24' below. But it is true for any full hd 27' monitor, pixelation will be there for text.It is excellent for gaming, csgo was an absolute delight on this panel.Now coming to stand - It was worst and kept shaking on accidental leg bump, any monitor will shake on leg bumps but duration of vibration was too much. It was a deal breaker for me and I returned it. (Maybe I got a faulty unit, but LG is notorious for shaky stands even on premium monitors). Buy a vesa stand or mount (they can be expensive).My Verdict : Excellent for media consumption and gaming, average for text, or coding (not a deal breaker)"
5,"First of all I'd like to mention that I purchased this monitor(27gl650f) for Rs. 19999 and its very well worth it. It is a 27 inch 1080P monitor so you really cant expect crisp images here. Many people here are complaining about its pixel density, any 27/32 inch monitor running on 1080p resolution will never give crisp images, if you want crisp images then go for 2k resolution for 27 inch and 4k resolution for 32 inch monitors. 27GL850 is a better monitor here but its almost 15k more expensive than 27gl650f so people who bought this monitor despite reading its a 1080p monitor dont have the right to come cry here for not getting crisp images, blame your own stupidity. Ok with that said, lemme start talking about what I liked and disliked about this monitor.What I liked -1) ZERO FLICKER - I've never once had a flicker issue, the screen ran flawlessly even when there were some power surges, my monitor isn't connected to my inverter-UPS line so most of the other monitors didnt handle this well.2) ZERO SCREEN TEARING ON NVIDIA GPU - I run this on my 2080super and this is one of the very few monitors that have G-SYNC at this price range so i've never faced any screen tearing issues.3) RESPONSE TIME @ Max Refresh Rate - make sure you keep RT at faster and not fastest, and the RT is roughly around 4ms but the 144hz definitely makes up for it.4) COLOR BLEED - am surprised reading that people say this has horrible backlight bleed, it has to be a defected piece because it has very low backlight and color bleed which is barely noticeable.5) REFLECTIONS - matte finish makes this monitor handle reflections very well6) IMAGE RETENTION - has 0 image retention. What I disliked -1) HDR 10 - its pretty bad, it looks more like a marketing gimmick but at this price point you cant really expect a great hdr 10 screen.2) Response time at 60Hz - its slow at this RT, average is around 12ms and its very surprising considering its avg 4ms speed at 144hz3) Build quality - not exactly a fan of ultragear build quality...most of it is plastic and the mount is pretty average. Good thing it has VESA 100x100 so wall mounting is always an option.Verdict: If pixel density is an issue then go for 27gl850 which has 2k resolution(1440p) and has better hdr10 display and better reflection handling when compared to 27gl650f but remember that it costs almost 33-35k so at this price point, this monitor is definitely worth the money."

1,"Product is ok, value for the money, but disappointed with the seller, there was no HDMI cable in the box, the I tried replacement still the seller sent the monitor without any HDMI cable even though it's mentioned that HDMI cable is included in the box and in the manual"
1,"Got A Faulty Panel White Borders Around The Panel,Never In My Life I Experienced 144 hz Display But The White Borders Around The Screen Just Ruined It,Asked For Replacement Will Update After Geting The Replacement.Edit: I Returned The Miserable Item Again In The Replacement The White Border Was Coming All Around The Screen, I Am Now Relieved After Getting Rid Of The Faulty Item,Guyz Pls Don't Buy This Monitor From Amazon,If You Are Buying This Monitor Check Out From Local Store.EDIT:Got The Replacement,The Screen Has Now Has Right Side White Border Which Is Unnoticeable So I Am Keeping It.Conclusion:Buy At Your Own Risk,Because Seller Is Dispatching Faulty Items Likely,Bunch Of Scalpers.Update : I Just Returned The Monitor For Refund As The Black Light Bleed Was Getting Worse And Worse ,Now I Am Feeling Relieved,Next Time Will Buy Monitors Or Tv From Local Store."
2,"First i use Samsung 21.5inch tn panel display 60hz, so pixel is great in display bcoz 21-24inch is sweet spot for 1080p, but i need to upgrade the Monitor for better gaming. So i buy this 27gl650-f and my experience is not good bcoz of 27inch display. It doesn't mean display is bad, display is ultimate for watching movies,pictures and videos so i return bcoz my first priority is gaming, i habitual to playing in 22inch display, but i dont like 27inch for 1080p.So if u want best ultra sharp gaming 1080p buy 21-23 inch display ips with 144hz and a freesync/ g-sync compatible.I will give 5 star for best panelI will give 1.5 star for 1080p Gaming"
5,"Firstly the looks are superb red black theme. monitor is best for gaming, no pixelation at all while playing games or surfing the internet..1) hdr 10 support best for movies2) 144hz feels great while playing fps shooter games such as csgo my gameplay is greatly improved3) very little screen bleading from right bottom side corner not an issue at all not even noticible4) Gsync compatible as well as amd free sync for those having nividia gpu and amd gpu5) monitor stand height and tilt adjustable6) brightness is very bright no issues at all that too with really good colour and contrast ratio7) anti glare screen so u wont see any glares and reflections irritating"
4,"The Monitor (GL650F) out of the box is not color calibrated. Rated it on a low score because its HDR is washed out a bit, lots of blue tint to it, otherwise its a good monitor, if you ignore slight pixelated view due to low resolution.Here are some color calibration and Gaming related settings to get the most out of your monitor;Brightness : 68 / 0 prefered - your choiceContrast : 50Gama : Mode 2Picture Adjust -> Color Temp -> Custom,then Set R/G/B - Red = 56, Green = 48, Blue = 42Response Time : FastAMD Graphics Card : FreeSync = onNVIDIA Graphics Card : 1MS = onYou cant have both 1MS and FreeSync ON, unfortunately.This is a good monitor for consoles, but if you use it for PC gaming then its a disappointment (even the LG GL850, infact, all 1080P monitors in year 2020). If its for PC go for at-least 2K or 4K monitors minimum 75Hz refresh rate, if your graphics card is not strong to give 60FPS at that resolution or stick to 144Hz, as consoles are going to be the next thing in future of Gaming thanks to Xbox Series X and Playstation 5."
5,"Very good colours, great pixel response, no ghosting whatsoever. Only down side is that it's 1080p only vs 1440p but definitely worth the price because its hard to come by a 240hz IPS monitor with good pixel response for 28k."
4,"Bought it for my Dual monitor workstation+Gaming setup. Planning to add a 4K UK650 with it which seems to have similar Bezel structure.Pros -1. Cost effective (Got it for 20K during Prime Day sale. So wait for discount on this)2. Thin bezel. Almost 89%+ display area3. VESA Mount possible and comes with an excellent stand with height and tilt adjustment.4. Sharp and enough brightness5. 1ms response rate. You can feel it during competitive gaming.6. 1 day delivery (May change based on location)Cons -1. Can view individual pixels due to FHD resolution. Not a big problem unless you are a photographer.2. Doesn't work with LG monitor management software.3. Does not include an HDMI cable. Only Display cable included.4. Function Menu not intuitive.5. HDR mode is kinda OK, not great. (Although depends on your GPU)Overall a great monitor if you are planning for 1080p gaming, documents, office work and dual monitor setup with another 2K/4K monitor for streaming. Value for money and with LG's awesome support network across India, reliable."
5,"Perfect viewing experience. The reason i took this one was because of the entry level G-Sync capabilities (it also has AMD free sync). I have a Nvidia GPU so it only makes sense to go for G-Sync compatible monitors to fully explore the gaming experience (Farcry, Tomb raider, fifa etc). You can opt for AMD Free sync monitors if you have a AMD Radeon GPUs (these monitors will be less expensive than G-Sync ones).90 degree rotation for potrait mode is additional benefit apart from height adjustment and screen angles. No motion blur, screen tearing found."
5,Value for Money and Good ProductAfter installing driver and OSD application - the display quality is very good.Specially the- 90 degree rotate- height adjustment- tilt adjustment- 2 HDMI- 1 display port- Split Screen options- Audio through HDMI- Black adjustmentare plus featuresThere will be need to alter audio out from Display to alternate system displayWill update after few days of usage
5,Jumping from 60 hz to 144 hz is awesome.just bought it already loving it smooth frames and awesome gameplay experience till now all over its is best in this segment nano ips 400 nits brightness.Allover my best gameplay expericence yet. morning it reached was play game till now and just like to share my experience till now.IF YOU HAVE THIS PRICE POINT IN MING JUST GO FOR IT YOU WILL THANK ME LATER:)
1,Video Player is loading.
4,"1 week review.Pros:- Delivered as advertised- Sturdy and quality build- Supports 144hz seamlessly- G-sync compatCons:- A little large (24in is large enough), User needs to sit at least 2.5 - 3 feet away from monitor to appreciate it fully.- Prominent side frame/bezels - should be narrower- the button at the bottom for config/settings is a little annoying to use as well as the menu bar.  Not a deal-breaker, thoughOther:- Not tested brightness fully - but current brightness at around 50% is good enough for most thingsCan be considered for fps-type games."
1,Dead pixels are for sure I returned once still got a dead pixelWorst service I had to go to the post office and ship it myself for return yes they gave me the money for it but still they could've picked it upTook more than one month for this process I had to call almost daily since they weren't acknowledging my problems
4,Very good monitor got for 20.5kIf u haven't experienced 27inch 1440p in real life then u won't notice the 1080pStand is adjustable in all ways up down portrait etc but is wobbly keep that in mindColor accuracy is what u would expect from LG IPS response time is 4-7ms gsync only on DP cableNo hdmi in box 1ms response mode gets invert ghosting which is annoying and I use it at 4-7ms onlyPaired with 1660S and Chillin
5,"Everything is good in this monitor except price, if you have high end graphics card which can generate much frames to be shown on the screen then I would easily recommend it. If you have mid specs graphics card I would recommend to purchase 144hz screen instead of 240hz because mid range graphic cards won’t generate much FPS or more than 144 , so better to save money. Overall it is a good product. Only buy it if you have good specs otherwise the purchase would be not value for money. Instead of this you can buy 144hz panel from LG itself same design and size at lower price which would justify your purchase."
5,Disclaimer: I’m no gamer / doesn’t do editing so don’t take this review for granted if you are either of above two.:-)I’m a sucker for looks and this Monitor definitely meets the criteria. Did fair amount of research and was okay with 27” monitor for 1080P ( most of the pros suggested 24” for 1080p if you are a gamer/do editing work) as most of the work i do is as of now is from a laptop.Monitor is sturdy and strong. Easy to assemble and hassle free. Comes with a DP cable and not HDMI. NO IN-BUILT SPEAKERS.
5,"240hz work fine, and IPS panel also awesome i have attached images you can see it.I am reviewing this after 3 days useIts work fine no issue . But when i am shutting down my pc that time one blink i have saw every time don't is this a problem or not .I will  Edit review after one month.Thank you"
5,"Perfect buy for gamers 🔥🔥First of all the stand, which is very sturdy and magically weight balanced by the monitor itself, to adjust the height all you need to do Just one finger to adjust the height.Monitor: to get a precious 144hz refresh rate you have to use display port , hdmi can't able to provide 144hz , hdmi supports only upto 120hz, and you can see the noticeable difference between 120hz and 144hz refresh rate.. 144hz is a treasure for gamers, with a good graphics card you can easily reach 144hz in high refresh rate games. I personally play euro truck simulator with this monitor I have attached a pic from that game you can see the colour reproduction of the monitor, in real life the clarity is so realistic and crystal clear.IPS panel: viewing is so good there is no point to complaint and it also has 1ms response time which is equal to VA or TN panel..in VA or TN panel you have to sacrifice viewing angle bcoz in those VA and TN panel the viewing angles are worst.. but in this lg 27gl650f ips panel has the best viewing angle and best refresh rate and best 1ms response time for this price, which is awesome 🔥HDR enabled monitor: which is actually true also it has many color modes, In that when you select HDR effect preset, you can see the colour difference magically I personally use the HDR effect which gives best colour by the monitor .G-sync and AMD free sync compatibility : no adjustments needed seperately for nvidia and AMD Radeon graphics card to adjust the monitor for graphics card output which is coolIt also has a adjustable response time, HDR (on / off), 1ms response time (on / off),cross hair function, you can adjust almost everything"
5,"You don't think twice when it comes with the logo of LG on it, that's true but explaining it even more, if you think this is a 27 inch 1080p so you're gonna see pixels, then you're damn wrong, I don't know what VooDoo LG is doing but man I love it , this is just too good for any use case scenario,  GAMING, PRODUCTIVITY  you name it, I have it using GSync and the refresh rate, the display and image quality,  the connectivity  the built, everything amazes me. Just go for it, don't think twice."
4,Eyes cant see what mind doesn't know.The monitor is an upgrade from 165hz tn to 240hz ipsColors are more vibrant and viewing angle although doesnt matter as gamers we normally sit in front of monitor still a huge improvement.Pair it with high spec pc and u will feel the difference.Csgo battlefield definitely looks betterMotion clarity is better then 165hz.U need to have eye to appreciate the difference.Not for video editors it is ment for gamers
3,"The screen bleeding is way more than the acceptable level, also the viewing angle is bad, I knew being a TN panel it will be bad but wasn't expecting it to be this bad. The bezels on 24"" are thicker than they look in pictures. Better to go for an IPS panel monitor, other similar priced brands are providing IPS panel with higher refresh rate and inbuilt speakers."
5,"This Monitor is Absolutely Bang for the Bucks. One if the Best 1080p monitors Available online.Pros:+ Clear Picture , Very accurate Colour.+ Viewing angle is more than perfect, you can even watch it from 140° angle and it won't fade any colour.+ Premium quality IPS Display.+ Solid build quality.+ Easily Provide 144Hz with 1ms Blue free Motion time.+ Adjustable Stand - supports tilt, pivot and Hight adjustment.Cons :- The Screen size is 27inch but the display is 1080p so the Pixel Density is Low.- You will see pixelation if you play 480p or 720p movies,videos. Only 1080p Content Recommended.- The Bazzels Should Have more Protective layers.- The box doesn't include HDMI Port, so if you want to use this as a secondary monitor for your laptop then you have to buy a HDMI cable Separately.- Only DP cable can support the full 144hz refresh rate, HDMI is limited to 120hz.- The HDR mode Slightly increase the Response time and You need a high end GPU to Run games with HDR and FreeSync or Gsync mode on.Overall It's a GOOD PRODUCT if you are planning to Buy a Monitor for all types of uses Including Gameplay, Watching Movies,And Editing."
1,"There is Bluish light at Left Side of the Monitor. It is more noticeable with white background. It disturbs when I do coding. I liked the Monitor But, the problem of the Monitor hunts me all time.Otherwise, With 144 Hz refresh Rate, it feels smooth when Gaming."
5,"I have never used a 144hz monitor before; this was my first.I have been gaming for the past 15 years. I predominantly play Apex Legends. I had a 21"" 60fps monitor for the last eight years, which was not great for fast-paced games like Apex. Secondly, shooting opponents far on 21 inches is tricky as you can not see them correctly on a 1x scope.Now about this monitor, I received 24lg650, which is pretty good for my standards. The movements feel smooth and strafing enemies can be tracked much easily. And I can feel the upgrade.My expectation was low for this NT panel, but surprisingly, the colour accuracy is not bad. There is a bit of ghosting in some specific colours combination, especially for light blue and light green objects that creates a dark brown trail. The kind of game I play did not affect me much. Also, keep in mind that by default, the refresh rate was 60hz. I had to set free sync to Extreme to make it 144hz"
5,"1) The Delivery was good.2) No defetcs3) 144hz is simply awesome4) Haven't tested FreeSync5) Perfect for gaming6) While coding, I was getting some eye strain staring at this big screen for a long time.There is no wrong with the product, I follwed these steps to overcome while coding.1) Please make sure that your sitting posture is right (check in youtube).2) Aligin the screen correctly.3) Maintain some distance from the screen and increase the coding console's  size.4) Reduce more brightness."
3,"The backlight under normal use conditions is a bit too much and hurts my eyes even at 50% brightness. If i lower it further it affects the color considerably and dark's become too dark in certain games and videos.However in general i need to keep the brightness at 30% or lower for it to acceptable not not completely strain my eyes.For me the eye strain is a deal breaker and thus it gets only 3 stars.  It is possible that other may be used to or comfortable with this  level of brightness,In all other situations this is an absolutely great monitor."
1,First of all 24inch is too much for me.second brightness is too high.144hz was giving me unforgettable headache.also its too bright and in menu button brightness can't be reduced at too low level.only price is plus.those who are migrating from small size monitor please demo before going to 24inch and 144 hz gives dizziness and headache.
5,"Pros:-.240hz indeed(use DP cable),but through hdmi only 120hz is possible.(available for most laptops) .Cables come included.Thin bezel,looks neat.27 inches works great for gaming (as i first doubted as most gamers use 24 inches) .Cons: Response time is 4ms since its IPS pannel ,not 1 ms(its just marketing) go for benq 240hz if you want true 1ms.Response time: faster has ghosting issues ,objecs will get thick lining which is truely bad for gaming.So use fast.Colors are better than TN but not better than true IPS..Go for 144 hz unless you want full game experience and your graphic card can pump up frames till 260fps"
5,"so i was skeptical to order this , many people reported back light bleeding , i dont have any, this is just amazing got it onprime day sale , and its a delight , perfect for gaming , ips display , videos look amazing , its just perfect , i like my setup clean so i guess the only thing i didnt like was the power brick , but ill find a way to hide it , 10/10 go for it"
1,This review After using 1 Month(Buy if you have 1050 nvidia or bigger )1.Build quality is good but body and frame very thick2.If your Looking for gaming use don't buy this one its not support its lagging every time in basic graphics card3.for Customer service 0 star4.technical person has zero knowledge about 4k settingMy PC Specifications16GB RAM4GB Graphics Cardi7 3ed Gen intel1TB HDD
5,I started playing Valorant in May and I was stuck in Iron rank. Then I invested in this monitor and it made a huge difference. I still suck and I'm in Iron. But atleast it feels better to suck in 4k than in HD.Highly recommend.
4,"I have been using this monitor for casual/light gaming with a mid-range graphics card and AMD Ryzen 5. I think this is worth mentioning because this monitor supports AMD Freesync.Also, I have been using a DP cable for connection. More on this later.PROS:1. Amazing peak brightness. Colours look true out of the box without any tweaking. There are however a few useful picture modes.2. The Brightness Intelligence Plus feature which adjusts the glare according to the ambient light in the room works pretty well for my application and my surroundings. Your mileage may vary.3. Relatively easy on the eyes even after extended gaming/work hours. Please note this is relative to a normal, price-efficient and generic monitor. (Oh, and please take frequent breaks and take care of your health!)4. This is my first 4K screen experience ever. 4K content looks pretty good & crisp. 1080p even better.5. I also use a 4K streaming box with this monitor. The viewing experience is as good as/better than a TV. (Of course, at a proper viewing distance as this is a 28-inch screen)6. Viewing angles are great for both text and videos. Personally, I did not see any issue with this.CONS:There a few cons which could be a deal-breaker for you. Please read on.1. The HDR 10 experience isn't that great. Do not buy this monitor merely for an HDR experience or you will be left disappointed.The major issue with HDR being blacks aren't consistent and colours can become choppy during some dark scenes. This was a major turnoff for me and I wish it were better. HDR just doesn't look good.2. I had to switch to a DisplayPort cable for the best experience after trying multiple HDMI cables with my desktop setup as mentioned above.With HDMI, the display flickered even after changing cables and getting expensive ones. Not sure if this was a one-off issue.Hence, I suggest using a DP cable if you are using a midrange or higher spec PC for the best results.However, the display works fine with a laptop connected with an HDMI cable. I did not see any issues with a laptop. Reason unknown!Conclusion: This is a decent buy for a 4K display intended for casual gaming, office work and great for 4K media consumption. Not if you are looking for a good HDR display. Also worth noting that the refresh rate is maxed out at 60 Hz with drops to be expected at higher than 1080p.Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask any questions in a comment below.Cheers!"
3,"I use a 16 inch macbook pro. When I decided to buy external monitor, I was concerned about1. Will a FHD monitor fit same content that I see in my laptop or lesser (No use of external monitor if it display lesser content than your laptop)2. Picture quality should be comparableReview :1. This LCD screen has decent colour image so ok if your work doesn't concern dark mode.But for all coders or other people who prefer dark mode, this screen has unacceptable levels of light bleeding. So much so that at the upper end of screen you can't see the borders of chrome tabs and there is clear gradient from top to bottom. (See the images attached. They show how light bleed gradient spreads across screen)2. Monitor is rated at 1.5A but for some weird reason ships with a 16A plug. You'll have to get separate socket fitted at your desk or get a 5to15A adapter.Advice :For all Mac users thinking of buying 4k monitors because of resolution parity :  No, you don't need a 4K monitor, because although your mac's native resolution is 4K, at default scaling, it works at FHD resolution only. Therefore, if you use a FHD screen, the content displayed in your screen vs external monitor will be approx same (although more granular owing to pixel density diff. Macbook pro packs 4k resolution in only 16 inches !!!)If you keep your mac at ""Default for Display"" resolution then -1. A FHD monitor will give you approx same content in a bigger screen, although you'll see a relatively grainy image.  If you can see 100 lines text on mac, you can see ~95-98 on FHD monitor2. A 27/28 inch 4K screen set at native resolution can show you 4 times the info of mac, but it'll come at the cost of screen to content ratio. At 4K scaling on 27 inch screen, text becomes too small to read. You can't really use the 4k for text display purpose, you'll have to use ~WQHD/FHD scaled resolution to see any text properly.3. For multimedia, yes, this monitor can render 4K videos. But where will you find them and do you have internet pack (speed + data limit) to support those? Majority of entertainment available commercially is streamed at FHD only. A FHD video watched at 3 feet distance on 27 inch screen or 6 feet distance on 55 inch screen seems detailed enough. Anything more than that seems too sharp to be pleasant.Note : Macs allow for FHD external monitor @60Hz and 4K @30Hz connectivity. So, you'll notice the flicker and shoddy refresh rate in a 4K monitor even when moving the mouse cursor."
1,I liked the build quality and responsiveness of the monitor but the contrast and the color quality is not upto the mark. Black is not Black its gray or very light.
5,It's a nice 4K HDR gaming monitor for Ps4 pro and Xbox One X if you don't want to spend on a 4K tv then go ahead with this monitor.
2,Viewing angle is not goodYou shift little and colors change.
5,"The colour reproduction is not accurate, which is expected for an eye care monitor. It is excellent for reading and office work; increases productivity by providing large screen real estate.I am running it over HDMI with my gaming-laptop, so 4K is available only at 30 Hz. At 30 Hz refresh rate the monitor is unusable, so I have to run it at 1440p resolution to get 60Hz. I believe this is a limitation of most 4K  monitors on the market. Unless you have a GPU which can connect to it through display port, do not consider a 4K monitor.I cannot be sure if the response time is 1 ms, but the monitor has no detrimental effect on gaming performance. If gaming is the priority, then obviously 4K is not the way to go and consider at least a 120Hz monitor.The speaker sound quality is horrible, and the volume is low. There is only tilt adjustment and no height adjustment, but the stand is heavy to support the monitor. The thick bezels make it look like an ancient device, but the whole construction is sturdy enough. Again this monitor is not worth the consideration if looks are important.This monitor is a great choice if utility is the priority, but it is definitely not worth the MRP of ₹ 42,800 and a bit on the expensive side at the current discounted price of ₹ 27,300."
2,"This monitor is good for generic purposes, but I am personally not happy with the viewing angles of this monitor.For an IPS panel viewing angles can be almost as good as 180 degrees, but his one starts showing a pale yellow color as soon as the angle exceeds about 30 degrees.On top of that Amazon customer service is not good. It seems this product is not eligible for return. But I did not find it anywhere in the return policy on the product page. On the product page it says it is written 10 days' return possible.I am not happy with the product Amazon, and I want to return it. How difficult is that? I have been using Amazon platform for years' now, but sorry to say I am highly disappointed with this particular experience."
4,"I have been using this monitor since a month for Gaming, Office work and for Media Consumption. Its a good 4k monitor for the price.Pros: It has great build quality, has brightness intelligence which adjusts the screen brightness according to room lighting conditions. Supports Amd vrr. Inbuilt speaker is an added bonus.Cons: This monitor is not ideal for watching movies. Don't get me wrong, its decent, but when the room light is bright, colors feels washed out especially if u compare with other brighter panels. Monitor looks great when you use it in the night. Brightness Intelligence icon at the bottom is too big and it distracts as it keeps popping up every few seconds."
4,"If:1. You have used a IPS panel you will not like this TN panel screen but you can get used to the washed out colours,2. You want a 4k screen and don't care about low refresh rate and HDR, BUY @ 20-21k,I would like to add that HDR is useless on monitors and it will take some time befor it becomes a focus. If you have never seen HDR you will see the difference but itnia nowhere near Dolby vision type of HDR.This is an old monitor from 2018 so keep that in mind.For a 4k screen this is the best priced screen I could find on Amazon.Perfectly fine for light AAA gaming, non design colour related work.With 4k you can go for the benq 30inch screen which is also well priced 30k.I like the no nonsense design, fits in perfectly with my setup.Note: it uses one of those big plugs."
5,"Excellent for console gaming, smooth performance and after tweaking a bit works amazingly well for the price.Runs Xbox One X set to 4KUHD with PCRGB colors and all adaptive refresh. Use Smart Resolution option to eliminate haze. HDR is garbage, good standard profile though. Content consumption is great for Netflix and YouTube. Good startup times and works well in a dark room for any kind of gaming. 300-400 nits is plenty for any 200-500 sqft bedroom which has shallow mood lighting.Overall, buy it for the trust. No problems in delivery."
4,"Very good monitor. Reduced 1 star as no cable management provided in stand. i had a benq 27 inch fhd monitor and it had a cable management slot in the stand which concealed the exposed wires. This does not have it and I don't know why. They could have added that same stand in this too.Otherwise very good display.Note: you would need a display port wire for 4k @60hz. If you use hdmi, you will get 4k @ 30hz and it will strain your eye."
5,"This is by far the best and biggest monitor I have ever owned.Pros :1ms response - no ghosting in fast paced multiplayer gamesEye care - can stare for long hours without any headache or painBrightness Intelligence plus works well, recommended to keep it onFullHD also looks great on this 4K monitor, with a OG PS427 inches is great big screenDesktop usage is wonderful with so much space due to 4k resolution2 HDMI ports 1 DP / UseUse Ycbcr422 with 10bit on Windows for best colorsCons :Colors might not be as good as IPS (well not for artists anyways)Speakers not very loud, I don't use it anyways :)Simulated HDR is not good, not recommended, better use only real HDR from device, like PS4"
5,Good picture quality and good brightness.BI + features is awesome it automatically adutte the brightness. the only issue is it came with 16A pulg normaly all pulgs are 6A for 40W 16A is not necessary. If you have 6A pulgin you have to buy 6 to 16A adapter or replace the pulg to 16
3,"I still feel It doesn't have that 4K clarity in it, not sure if it because of the big black edges it had, I feel the normal acer monitor with bezel less edges has super bright and calibration when connected to Mac but it doesn't.I got pain in my eyes when continuously used, so I feel would have spend some more money and bought other 4K monitor which has Bezel less edges."
1,"For the name sake only it gives 4K. If increase of resolution is your only need, go ahead, other than that, this monitor is just a a big normal screen. Colours are not aligned. Pixel quality is not at all grade. Plastic looks ok. But not value for money. rather but LG QHD 32 inch in same price."
5,"You cannot expect TV like hdr bcoz it is monitor for pc not tv , you have to sit close to it and work on it, not like tv to watch from distance. So whatever hdr and brightness eye care is there that is perfect…Let see durability…. I will update !!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"+Very sharp image, Fast response time in FPS games, no (very minimal) bleeding, no image retention whatsoever.Great for PS4 pro.Good for watching movies.BI works well for web browsing, coding, reading.-HDR is not enjoyable as max brightness is 300 cd, (occasionally some improvments can be observed in some games like Spider-man, Judgement etc)Freesync has limited range 40hz to 60hz, also max screen refresh rate is 60hz"
4,"If you need a cheap monitor to make the use of your 4k systems, this is a decent pick. HDR isn't good, colors are ok but ping is good. Might be prudent to spend a little extra and get a better monitor/TV but if you're constrained by budget, you can buy this."
2,The monitor is not HDR 100%.The monitor average refresh rate is around  6.5 ms - it is not 1 ms.Side Bezels are very thick.BenQ - pls dont sell this as a HDR monitor.
5,Awesome monitor.4k quality is so smooth and crystal clear.Gaming was a charm.Doing office work is so easy in the bog screen.
5,"No other products available at this price range! It is soothing to eyes, brightness adjusts automatically depending upon the light in the room! No irritation in eyes even after spending 16+ hours on pc!The only con is that it is LCD not LED, however the picture quality is amazing. Gaming experience is next level!"
5,"You gotta love this product given its price range and hdr function. Amazon delievered it a day earlier which feels like surprised diwali gifts all over again.Many reviews have criticised its HDR function but i find it cool. You can clearly see tge difference (but may be i havent used any other hdr monitor vefore who knows) but all in all good product.For gaming :- you got to have a good graphics for its ultimate optimum usage.For movies :- one of the best, may be, out there at this price."
5,"This is a reasonably priced 4K gaming monitor with HDR. Supports AMD Freesync, but does not support Nvidia G-sync. Works great with Linux and Windows although there is no HDR support in Linux.Worth purchasing..."
5,This is a quality product from BenQ. Bought it just few weeks back.I am currently using it as a extended monitor for office work. It works fine and 28 inch is quite bigger than I expected. With 4k resolution I get ample amount of real estate on the display to accommodate various things.I haven't tried gaming on this monitor yet. However I have ran videos on it and clarity is awesome.
5,"Build quality is very good, has metallic stand instead of those flimsy plastic ones. Display is good too. Just a heads up, it has one of those bigger power plugs, not the regular small ones."
4,"4k Picture quality off from chat , but there is a cache its only good for Video and PicturesLike someone who just want to watch youtube or movies.its support 4k - 60, but dont support 2k : 144 or 1080p 144hzThe max u can go with 720p with 75hzSo my review : best for pictures, movies and entertainmentBut worst for gaming"
4,The connection is instantaneous. The display has many options. The view is idea of working long hours. I do not use it for gaming so cannot comment about frame rate. The embedded speaker quality is also not good. This is why it is losing one star. Overall a very good experience. I shall add details about its reliability on usage.
5,"This is a very good low cost 4K HDR monitor if you looking for gaming purpose only, especially for console gaming. If you looking a monitor for photoshop work or work where you need color accuracy then it is not for you."
1,I bought this for xbox one s and it doesn't work...might be the product is damaged...option to return by Amazon is complicated...worst
1,"not sure which issue to write the monitor itself is a disaster. One you buy the product, you are stuck with it as you can't return the product. it can only be replaced.it's a complete waste of money."
1,"It's an LCD not LED. The refresh rate is 1s, not 1ms."
4,"Best 4k monitor under 25k, 28 inches is sufficient to play games for an average sized room.The picture quality is good compared to price.The speaker output is below average, you either need a sound bar or headphones for support."
5,"This is the best monitor I love itIt is best for gaming, and the brightness is superb👍👍👍I would give 💯/100👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️, if you want a best monitor under 20,000 Rs then, I say go for it 🙏."
4,overall good. dp cable is not provided. However you will get hdmi cable. in q&a it is mentioned that dp cable is included. Don't buy if you are a designer. color is not that accurate. Good for all other purpuse and excellent for gamming
5,Video Player is loading.
3,Forget about the sound quality. Barely you can hear it. Picture quality is kind of OK. you will not say wow.
1,do not buy for ghaphic designservice is useless1.Build quality is good but body and frame very thick2.If your Looking for gaming use don't buy this one its not support its lagging every time3.for Customer service 0 star
5,28inch 4k Good for raspberry pi 4b. good for eyes. also good as a second monitor
1,"This monitor fraud with us, Because this monitor has tn-panel but this is not mentioned in description I don't love this monitor. And also I'm not using this monitor from the day it arrived at my home. And for gaming there is better monitor in market with ips display. I dont recommend this monitor for budget gamers also."
4,Good product. Resolution is good. Both VGA and HDMI working. One HDMI cable should be added. Value for money.
4,Serves the purpose and it works fine. Good for office use. Or Work from home and use it as a secondary screen.
3,"When i first ordered the product, i received a damaged and broken product. I complained about it and i got a working product now. Happy for the seevice. I have been using this monitor as my t.v. till now it is ok. It's only one day so i shoukd wait and update my review."
4,"Decent enough monitor. Didn’t face any issue. Packed well. Working as expected.All buttons are provided at the back of the monitor. Bit inconvenient. As we wont change settings freq, it is ok."
1,"It not even displying any thing properly, seems like pannel getting issue and pink color is comming while plugin.Seems products not tested properly after manufacturing ( there is no quality test for this product)so some products will work properly and some other will not( behaviour is not consistent)Think before order, if ur lucky ur display will work( there is no guarantee).@manufacturerKindly test atleast basic functionality before shipping to customer"
5,"I got replacement for faulty monitor and got this as new which I used about five months or so but now this one is also starting troubling, as display gets totally blank every 10 secs and continues problem repeatedly. Initially work fine but now it's totally a crap monitor. I should have purchased some other better brand."
1,It's been exactly one and a half months since I bought this and it hasn't worked properly. If this monitor does not work in a month it is a waste of our money Stop buying thisI've bought countless items on Amazon Nudity but this is the only substandard item like this.
5,Best product
1,Received the product with a 'Damaged' tag pasted on the thermocol packaging of the monitor & the warranty sticker being tampered. Would have totally gone unnoticed had I not closely paid attention & the seller would have been glad to have tagged a damaged product to their customer thinking they would not notice. Anyways returned the monitor. Be careful to check your product for these defects.
1,Unfortunately I got a defective pieceIt just didn’t startThankfully they took it for return the very next day and I was paid back on time too ..
3,It does not have hdmi slot...it's old school that's why cheap...
5,"nice product cheap and best quality, good stuff at this price rangeBut picture quality is disappointing, if you are looking for some game and video video playing stuff then don't go for it, but just for office work then it's the stuff for you.For gaming not at all recommended...."
1,It doesn’t work..first time plugging in and this is the only screen that shows up..waste of money
3,Value for money
4,Pretty awesome piece.And I just got it only for 2600rs.With the offer of exchange of old led.

5,"Pros-1. Mobility in monitor stand.2. 27 Size inch monitor in a budget price.3. This newer version of more popular dell p2719h.  Because it's launched recently their isn't much rating also currently price is cheaper that p2719h.Cons-1. HDMI Cable not included, You may have to make run to market, get share your laptop screen on this monitor.2. 16 A plug for charging monitor. Many buyers may not have such socket at their desk setup."
4,Worth for multiple purposes...I like the picture quality....1MS speed and 144 frame rate actually u can feel it.
4,"Firstly, this monitor is such a package , very good for gaming it is a TN panel so if ur coming from an IPS panel u maybe dissapointed at first like I was but trust me after doing some research and figuring out the right color calibration u will be satisfied. This is a 2018 model but this is better than the ones which have been launched afterwards, as this monitor has minimal bessels on the sides and the Stand of this monitor is really well made.Gaming  - 5Style - 5pic quality - 3.5 after color calibration 4built - 5"
5,"The best 144hz monitor in the price range. The quality of AOC brand is quite evident here. Even the packing speaks for itself. All in all, worth every bit you pay."
4,"Good monitor, good features, just strong overdrive is not recommended."
5,G2590PX gaming monitor is the perfect mix of technology and experience as it comes with 144Hz refresh rate and 1 ms response rate. It's Low Blue mode protects your eyes from hatful short waves and is always multi-media ready for your entertainment with HDMI Input.
5,Awesome experience for ganing and editing as well.
1,Do not buy. Looting customers. Actual price is 22999. Plus there's is wireless earphones free offer. So ultimately the monitor costs 20k.Wait for the price to drop to 22k. Useless.Ban these type of sellers
1,Bought it from Kora solutions but received a defective product. Now from last 2 days following up on replacement request and seller says they can max repair the product but cannot replace or return it.I did raised this complaint with Amazon for replacement or refund. But Amazon said that they are just a courier service and work as a broker between seller and customer. If there is any issue with product they cannot help. Customer need to do whatever seller recommend. If seller says they cannot help then Amazon cannot do anything. These were the exact words mentioned by Raj N from Amazon leadership team.After multiple frustrating follow up with Samsung and seller I got money refunded.Thanks Seller for helping me with the refund
5,"Samsung Odyssey G7 is a great monitor for both gaming and watching movies and tv series.PROS: 👍1. 240hz2. 1440p resolution3. Gsync compatible4. VA panel (deep blacks are great)5. curved monitor, so you don't have to turn your head too much while sitting close. (no it doesn't feel too curved just right at the point)6. core lighting, puts less stress on your eyes in dark.7. the pixel density is about 109 PPI so it's obvious the text clarity will be good as well8. comes with two 3.0 USB slots, so you can plug your mouse and keyboard.9. It comes with HDR 600. movies, games, and series look great watching on HDR.CONS: 😌1. gets hot easily when HDR is on, you can feel the heat on your face, but having an ac room should fix that issue.2. THE PORTS ARE A NIGHTMARE TO REACH !! they are so hard to access, if you don't have a big table you'll struggle to find ports just by the feel of hands. what makes it super hard is they are not visible from the back or can be felt with a hand easily.3. Just HDR 600, HDR 600 isn't great but better than the fake HDR 400 certified monitors.4. core lighting isn't bright enough with half of the available colors so make sure to choose the bright color.5. most importantly, the stand is huge which might not an issue for big tables. i suggest a gas-powered VESA mount.6. Vulcan and HDR aren't compatible for some reason, your monitor will go blank and won't start without replugging the power cord.EXTRA: no dead pixel or any sort of faults in my unit, Bought it for 43500rs"
1,Grainy pictures and crushed blacks in dark scenes in movies or youtube videos.Good for gaming
3,"This monitor has the following issue (firmware 1011.0):When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is ON - Micro-stuttering in games when slow camera panning - like when you use a gamepad or controller to pan the scenery. This micro-stuttering is not present if ""VRR Control"" is switched OFF.When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is OFF - If frame rates go above 90 fps, then there is a lot of inverse ghosting. Cannot correct this inverse ghosting as ""Response Time"" is disabled during ""Adaptive Sync"" ON. Another issue is that even if you play 60 fps games, LFC engages at 72 fps, so a 60 fps game is actually running at 120 fps on the monitor which is in the ""inverse ghosting"" region. You can bring down the LFC lower boundary to 30 fps by CRU (see some reddit posts), so that 60 fps games do not get overshoot. But mind you at such low fps without LFC flickering issue can be seen."
5,The beast of all the Gaming monitors. You would fall in love with it and never want to go back to flat screens. The only competition it has is its G9 model which is way too expensive.G7 is the best thing you would love from your gaming rig and can fully utilize all the newest GPUs with this.It is a bit heavy but worth every penny.Kudos to SAMSUNG for this fantastic product.
5,"I use it an my daily driver for gaming, watching movies and create graphics design. The curve gives you a pretty good end to end viewing angle that makes you feel the display is all around you.Though it's price is high compared to other monitors available in the market, I'm satisfied with this product."
5,"Background:I have a decent gaming rig (RTX 3070) and was using a LG 32GK650F 32"" 1440p 144Hz VA panel with my setup. I mostly play FPS (CS, Valorant) but also occasionally play RTS (AOE2), AAA titles and consume a decent amount of video and browsing content as well. The main reasons for upgrading were: low pixel density of LG monitor (webpages and text looked awful), black smearing (I mostly use black backgrounds and boy the smearing was bad) and maybe size (found 32"" to be slightly big for FPS games).Other considerations:Considered many alternatives varying from 27"" 1440p to 32"" 4K monitors. Most of the 27"" 1440p monitors were limited to 144/165Hz and while it was not a deal breaker but it was inferior to 240 Hz anyways. I would have gone for 4K 144Hz monitors but then my RTX 3070 wouldn't be enough for 4K gaming. 280Hz/360Hz 1080p monitors were out of question because I don't play competitively at that level. HDR at this price range is just a marketing gimmick. You need atleast a 1000 nits panel with multiple local dimming arrays for a decent HDR experience. IMO HDR is mostly suited to OLED panels.IPS vs VA:Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 have the best VA panels in the world and are the fastest VA in the market beating even the top IPS panels. I mostly use black backgrounds and play in dark so VA were obviously a better choice with high contrast ratio and no IPS glow. The only thing that was bothering me was black smearing which luckily Samsung has done such a good job that it's on par with IPS panels. IPS do have better viewing angles but then again it wouldn't matter if it was a curved display in the first place. I don't share my screen so curved and slightly less viewing angles were ok with me.What's great:I got a decent panel with minimal backlight bleed, no dead pixels, no black smearing. Colours are far better than my previous LG monitor. Contrast and colours are great. Display is sharp and crisp and gets bright enough to use it in a well lit room. Out of the box display calibration was decent. Games look beatiful. The curve is aggressive and took me around a day to get used to and now I love it. I can keep the monitor close and focus on the center of screen (in FPS games) and still have field of vision in the corners. I use it on a DP 1.4 cable at 1440p 240Hz 10 bit (8bit+FRC).What's not so great:Size. The monitor is thick and the curve is to blame here. Make sure you have enough space on your desk. Secondly, the stand is just huge. It is very stable and offers every kind of adjustment but for a 27"" panel it is just plain huge. I use a monitor arm so that isn't an issue for me but it's something to keep in mind. Pricing is a hit or miss. Look for price cuts during sales. But comparing to other brands this is decently priced. Other brands like LG, Asus, Gigabyte has a huge difference in offshore and Indian pricing which I just consider plain cheating and greediness.Conclusion and recommendations: It's a great all rounder monitor albeit for a selected audience. It is highly recommended for someone who wants the best of both worlds (FPS+AAA gaming), prefers to use the monitor in the dark, isn't bothered by the curve, has enough space on desk or a monitor arm. Consumers who play eSports competetively should look for 1080p 280/360Hz monitors. And those who play on consoles or AAA games only should eye a 4K 144/120Hz display or OLED displays (especially for HDR). IPS panels for those who wants wider viewing angles and share screen and are not bothered by IPS glow and low contrast ratio. This is all from a gamer's perspective only as I don't use any productivity applications. Hope this helped you!"
5,"Everything i expected from this monitor, i got. I was skeptical at first since people mention flickering/stuttering issues, but my unit did not have those issues. 1440p 240hz at 10 bit color works fine with the included displayport cable since my 2070S has DP1.4 DSC support. No visible ghosting/smearing (regular or black level) and overshoot. HDR is pretty good with the max brightness of 600 nits and around 90% dcip3 and an upgrade over SDR (although not as good as my Galaxy Note 9, which is a self emissive display with 1000+ nits peak brightness and a wider color gamut).My only complaint is the VRR range of the monitor. Nvidia lists this monitor's range as 60 to 240hz, yet LFC seems to trigger as early as 90hz. If a game stays above or below 90fps, it's a non issue; but if a game moves constantly above and below 90fps, it's gonna be distracting since there's some stutter before the monitor moves in and out of LFC (This is evident for me when playing Doom eternal maxed out with rtx on). Not sure if this is from the monitor's side or nvidia's implementation of LFC on Freesync monitors."
1,Worst picture qualityPlease refrain from buying this monitor
5,I bought the 27’ monitor for my Xbox series X and it’s freaking amazing. Better performance than any other monitors that I used before for FPS shooter games . Great color and TN like low input performance. If you have the money just go for it . 100 % Future proofed.

5,One of the best monitor..1000R curvature is simply awesome..specially for gaming! Definitely a thumbs up! Watching movies and designing stuff is also good
5,"Very good product for gaming mashine.we are happy to buy this product.good performance in gaming sagment.Nice resolution,nice picture quality"
5,Buy 2 of these and enjoy. Only con it is not 4k monitor but their is no regret in purchasing it.
1,"I'm the first buyer of this product.The one that I received was defective. It had a pale red patch in the top center of the screen. Image attached. Currently returning this one for a replacement. Will update as the replacement arrives.Things you should know before buying this product:1. It is a Gsync compatible only monitor, not a Gsync ultimate one. This means there is no Gsync module inside. It is just an Nvidia version of Freesync.2. The one I received had little to no backlight bleeding, but there was huge amount of IPS glow and it was awful. Rtings.com also says that this monitor has such high amounts of IPS glow. The backlight bleeding varies from unit to unit.3. Poor viewing angles - The viewing angles on this monitor is like that of a TN panel. This is because of the strong IPS glow. Rtings.com also found the same.4. Vignetting effect - The horrendous amount of IPS glow creates a vignetting effect. Pixels farther away from the screen appears dim.5. Non-uniform brightness - The brightness is not uniform everywhere on the screen. This is also related to the vignetting effect.6. There were two dead pixels that I could find. Being a 4k display, they were far too small to cause any nuisance.There were no issues of flickering, or vertical banding or sleep-to-wake problem, or dust particles being stuck beneath the screen.Some good things about the monitor:1. The colors are terrific. I haven't seen such beautiful reds. They are like blood.2. If you are a programmer, then dark modes look beautiful on this one (and in general on all IPS monitors). Dark mode is typically bad on VA monitors because of the high contrast ratio of VA panels that makes the text look like floating on ink. On IPS panels, dark backgrounds look like they are moonlight, if you understand what I mean. On VA panels, the background is like deep ink. IMO, the moonlight is more easy on the eyes.Overall this is the cheapest 4k144Hz monitor. I don't think you will find anything better than this up until the X27. If it were not for the red patch in the center of the screen, I would have kept it.Also, I couldn't comment on the fluidity of the panel, since my GPU does not support 144Hz output. I have purchased a new GPU which will take a few days to arrive. I'll update this review after that. Also, I'll update on my findings with the replacement unit.Update:--~~~~~~~~This is incredibly shameful. I wrote 10+ emails, called Amazon customer care 10+ times, and even today I spoke with a senior customer care executive who escalated the matter. But still the return pickup guy did not come to pick up the aforementioned items.Currently, I am waiting on my 11th day since I started the return process."
5,"Based on an IPS panel by Innolux, which is also used in the Gigabyte Aorus AD27QD , the Acer XV272U monitor supports 10-bit color via dithering (8-bit + 2-bit FRC) and covers 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut (~130% sRGB). For 10-bit color, you will have to limit the refresh rate to 120Hz. Gsync working without any issues with RTX 2070 over a DP cable even though this is not certified compatible. HDR is a gimmick but nice to have. You cannot use both FreeSync and HDR at the same time.There are three response time overdrive presets (Off, Normal, and Extreme). You cannot use ‘Extreme’ and VRR (FreeSync) simultaneously.At 144Hz, the Acer XV272U input lag amounts to only ~4ms when you enable the Ultra-Low Latency option in the OSD. There are no issues when it comes to the performance; no excessive IPS glow, backlight bleeding, or dead/stuck pixels.If you don’t need HDR nor DCI-P3 color gamut, there is more affordable 27″ 1440p 144Hz IPS models such as the Acer Nitro VG271UP without the stand adjustment.  HDMI cable is included in the box. DP cable needs to be purchased separately."
3,"Hello friends,  there is no much reviews available for acer xv270p , so i wud like share experience.If you are a person looking for high quality display for colors like professional and evrything then this monitor is not for you.If u are a person looking for budget monitor with decent specs-  then Yes. ButBudget IPS panels have weird issues.I got the first monitor,  which had dead subpixels. Rest all was good no back light bleed or anything.The seller was kind to replace and amazon for  helping. It was a good experience to shop from seller and amazon as they acknowledged the issue and helped meSo i got the replacementBut the replacement product had back light bleeding and it had a power cord thats not suitable for the room sockets, you cannot plug in, u need a socket ment for heavy appliances like AC ,Oven and all.So i was surprised,  the previous one had dead pixel and very raerly a discolouration vertical line, rest everything was perfect, the cord size and all.Second one had black light bleed and incompatible power cord socket which make it unusable,  using that cord nd shoving it into ur monitor with higher input volt , specially in india where voltage fluctuate. Also u can't put into UPS sockets.I did not understand  Why ! , same product and so much different with accessories. i couldn't unnotice the huge manufacturing differences and came to conclusion that the replacement is a defective product and the first one too.I still wanted the same model as its good monitor if u get everything right, but i couldn't get replacement again, so ended up returning.Huge thanks to amazon and support. Because seeing the other reviews i thought i  wud lose money , i was fortunate to get things done.I also had video backup of unboxing process so no one points in later stage.Conclusion: all the monitors in this price range have one or the other issue,  some face it soon, some later. And also u can b lucky to not face any issues at all.So because amazon service is good, i wud definitely say, u can buy the monitor chances of getting good one is more. Dont get confused with reviews.If u feel u wont get replacement or return then dont buy.Welcome to the world of cheap IPS panels, where i feel manufacturers are just pushing new models as competition rather than making sure about quality and reliability.  what i feel abt manufacturers in 2020.Usability : if u are not going to keep like minimum 1feet distance from monitor then u wud propably notice the pixels clearly in Full HD 27inch monitors. Some of u may not like this. They can opt for 24inch as it has higher DPI.Also the MRP price was less than what its shown and make u feel getting huge discounts.Feedback to manufacturer: i would like to say, this monitor has potential to grow in market,  the quality needs to be improved and make the screen reliable for heavy use in long run.  This could be the only reason if this model fails in long run.Also please update the accurate product description in acer india website , i did not find the model itself. Which was stressful as cannot depend on just amazon description which is not complete.I tried reaching to Acer customer support,  trust me , i couldn't go further from IVR response . Difficult to reach for any enquiry and service. Please resolve the issue.Feedback to amazon: i returned the product with top notch conditions,  but the pick up person to verify the product, handles badly due to hurrying up the process, i was like doing that way will definitely screw up product in process.Products like this that has display and these days bezel less,  needs more care during handling."
1,"Ordered 2 gaming monitors from Amazon. One was delivered on 28th April and another on 30th April. When i tried to set up the monitors, realized that one of the monitors was shipped with a 16A power plug which doesn't fit into any of my sockets. Immediately i ordered new cables from Amazon which were delivered the next day.Once the monitors were set up, I immediately realized one of the monitor's brightness was completely different. It was like the blue light filter was by default ON. Upon checking all settings were exactly the same. Swapping, different HDMI cables nothing worked.  I reached out to Acer support in this regard on 2nd May. After some basic troubleshooting, they determined that a service engineer would visit for further troubleshooting. However, no one came nor called to date.Later I called Amazon customer service and a hand-to-hand replacement was arranged.The replacement product was received on 8th May'21. Bummer this one has the same exact issue. Upon investigating both monitor packages. I realized that the good monitor was manufactured in Jul'20. The other 2 (Replaced & Replacement) monitors were manufactured in Nov'20.Again called Amazon customer service, spoke to multiple people. Everyone seems to echo the same scripted resolution. They can only issue a refund for the replacement monitor and not the entire order. I need a Dual monitor for my work. How can I use 2 monitors with different color and brightness levels? Can't Amazon support NOT understand such a simple thing. Also was I repeatedly being advised to place a new order with no guarantees from Amazon customer service that I wouldn't Nov'20 batch monitor. After much argument, a Manager call has been arranged in 48 hrs. Let's see what that person has to say.@AMAZON Support:I DON'T NEED A REFUND. Just REPLACE it with a Ju1'20 manufactured product or REPLACE the Jul'20 product with NOV'20 manufactured product. I am ok with either one of the resolutions.@ACER:What kind of quality control do you have? Also, your support is equally PATHETIC."
5,"Bought this monitor after searching long and hard for a proper upgrade to my aging 1080p 23inch AOC monitor. Needed something for gaming, consuming content with vivid and accurate colours and big enough to immerse me in it completely. Found this to be the perfect fit, albeit in the pricier range, and with 144hz feature that isn't of much use for me in the immediate future, but worth it in the long run.The colours on this monitor is absolutely gorgeous. It comes colour calibrated, along with a document showing the details of the calibration. The brightness is more than enough to force me to turn it down to 20-30% for normal web use. The I/O is great, with support for DP 1.4. The HDR is decent, as one would expect for HDR 400 certified monitor.  As for the backlight bleeding mentioned in other reviews, I haven't really found it to be that distracting or overpowering.  The bezels are small on 3 sides, allows for the 27inch screen to stand out. Something that isn't clear in the pictures given on the site is the amazing stand it comes with that allows for 90 degrees rotation (maybe 360 degrees too, haven't tried) of the monitor, a decent amount of height adjustment, as well as a solid base that allows for easy swiveling of the monitor, all welcome additions.However, do note that the packaging it came in was damaged for me. Seems like an amazon issue rather than the seller as others have had a much better experience. The box had multiple cuts, deep ones, but thankfully, the monitor inside seems undamaged.There was an issue with the transaction in my case, but the seller xtronicsapp was very helpful in communicating with me and promptly solving that issue with no hassle at all. Something I didn't expect from any seller on this site, so 5 stars to xtronicsapp. Go for this monitor if you have the money, and go for the seller for a great customer service given in case any issue should arise."
1,"Seeing the positive reviews i bought one recently and the monitor had a color temperature issue, the top half of the monitor is cooler and bottom half is warmer, no amount of tinkering with the color temperature settings can solve this issue but had no backlight bleeding. I decided to get a replacement because its very noticeable on a white background or light color background. The second monitor has huge backlight bleeding on the right side and the same color temperature issue. I am done with Acer monitors, last year i tried VG271UP which had bleeding from everywhere but no temperature issue. At this point i have returned 3 monitors in a span of 4 months. The quality control for these IPS displays are horrible. I cant spend 25k+ and live with a defective monitor. Time to move on to a different company and pray that i receive a good monitor. Thanks to amazon's quick refund/replacement policy during situations like these."
5,This monitor is way better choose then Acer Nitro VG271U . It has a great brightness and supports HDR. It's height adjustable. The quality is perfect with even support for 1 MS delay . If you are gamer but also enjoy multimedia better go for this then the TN pannel. You will enjoy it better.
3,The monitor is bright and colourful besides the edge glow and too much backlight bleeding which is common among most acer monitors. It’s actually on luck and there are possibilities that your display has less bleeding while I was very unlucky that my monitor had excessive bleeding so I returned it back. Seller quickly accepted the returned and my money was refunded in 4 working days. Now I have order a BenQ monitor ex2780q which had better review than this monitor. Choosing a monitor for gaming is tough decision so I would suggest you to do R&D On display types on YouTube. I spent 4 days to finally go for BenQ. Wish me luck on its arrival. Hoping for good results
5,"After completing close to one month research for a dual-purpose Monitor, I choose this Acer product, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. Price, features and Technology are in perfect balance. Important information regarding USB usage, there is one cable provided by Acer with this product which needs to be connected to the computer, to enable USB on the monitor. Without this cable, only charging will happen and no other device will work. G-Sync works very well on this monitor( I am using GTX 1660 ti ).Highly impressed with 2K resolution, HDR and 144hz refresh features. With 30k budget, I couldn't find a better product than this comparing with LG, BenQ which are charging 5k extra for similar functions."
5,"FYI for Indian buyers: This monitor comes with a 15A cable instead of a regular 5A one. You may not have 15A outlets in your room, so if you're getting this monitor, make sure you have an extra 3-PIN POWER CABLE (for desktops and monitors, NOT laptop 3-pin power cable) that's rated for 5A. Acer has approved 5A cables to be used with this, and I'm using one with no issues.Now, for the actual review. This monitor is excellent. It has deep black levels, and the colour contrast is fantastic. However, brightness settings are weird because the lowest setting is way too high.I'll admit, 144Hz is not the kind of revolutionary upgrade I'd expected it to be, but it definitely makes first-person games look and feel much better to play.Speakers kinda suck, so definitely use headphones or get external speakers. Height adjustment is definitely a plus, and the monitor and stand both feel quite sturdy.Granted, I've only had it for a short while now, but I'm really liking it so far."
3,"Cons1) my eyes hurt like crazy after using it for like 30 minutes maximum brightness is all good but the minimum brightness of this monitor is similar to about 80% brightness of my macbook (2017 13 inch). Unfortunately I'll have yo return this for this single reason.2) other reviews said that there was very less issue of backlight bleeding but you can see the pictures for yourself3) if you're coming from something like a macbook you'll immediately notice that the texts are not as sharp this is because of less ppi. If you're not a gamer I'd suggest you to go for a 4k monitor with less refresh rate.4) it says on details and features section that you can rotate 90 you can but the stand it comes with will get in your wayPros1) as far as i can tell colors are better on this monitor compared to my macbook (note: just my personal experience not an expert)2) it's one thing to imagine how big it'll be but mannn this this is huge.3) 144hz: i plugged my mac and started using it didn't notice anything, but as soon as i went back on my mac screen bro i was like where's the smoothness did my mac break so something is it lagging? You can feel while scrolling4) brightness if you like it it gets crazy bright5) good stand other from not rotating 90 degree"
3,I have used two high performance 2k monitors in past acer xb271hu and benq ex2780q.This is the xb273k gp version and doesnt match to all the xb273k reviews you’d find.This monitor has great response times cant measure but feels way better than the above two mentioned great colors and no issues with gsync.Perfect for gaming.But this has a pretty weird issue in light backgrounds everything’s good but in dark (games like metro exodus) you’ll have to move your head around becomes pretty annoying at first I thought it to be bad ips glow but comparing to benq seems like it has on par or less glow(with blue led is this one) but I don’t understand whats the issue is either its the coating applied or something else but  I am going to keep this as this is otherwise a great 4k gaming monitor.But there’s this weird greyish hue on the bottom two corners and its pretty evident.
5,The box looked a little worn. but when opened and installed i got a pretty good panel little to no backlight bleed and the IPS glow is also pretty less HDR 400 is very less but i use my pc in a dim lighted room so 400nits is enough so far. Amazing for gaming. would not recommend overclocking to 144hz on 4k as there is not much difference from 120Hz to 144Hz. but you will have to use 2 display ports to achieve that at the cost for color accuracy.. Will update in a few weeks are testing it on RTX 3080
5,"Update after 1 Year.This is a great monitor, I dont even see the backlight bleed anymore in the replaced unit. I've been using it each day for 8-10 hours without any issues.The stand is a little wobbly, but no major issues.Will buy another one to complement it and build my multi monitor system further.----------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE after 20 days - Backlight bleed is visible in dark backgrounds, attaching for reference, will be replacing this from the brand and will update here after that. Apart from the the monitor is great.----------------------------------------------------------------------Fantastic value for money monitor.This high quality 2k 144hz ips panel  with superb calibration is unparalled in IndiaThe stand is great too. But if you are planning to get a vesa mount , then the vg271u would be cheaper option with same panel.Negligible blb, ips glow isn't visible to naked eye and no dead/stuck pixels.------------------------------------------------"
5,"Summary/TL;DR: Buy if you care about high refresh rate, adequate resolution, and color accuracy.  If you only care about two out of these 3, there are other better monitors for your use cases.Pros:1. Fantastic color accuracy. I am an amateur photographer and work extensively on a macbook pro 15. That screen sets the reference for me. The had a Dell 24 inch monitor earlier (which was no match to the macbook). The acer is indistinguishable to my eyes from the macbook in terms of color unless you look very deeply2. Resolution: There are a ton of 4K monitors for the price with similar color accuracy. There are also a ton of 1080p 240hz monitors for the price. Depending on your specific use cases those might be better. But I find 1440p perfect for me as most upper mid-range GPUs (<Rs. 20K) are perfectly capable of using the resolution and the 144hz refresh rate too.3. Refresh rate: Just like resolution, I think 144hz is the sweet spot for refresh rate. Everything from just browsing to gaming feels great. Anything higher is difficult to practically achieve with affordable graphics cards and IMO harder to distinguish too (I honestly can't make out 240Hz from 144Hz unless looking for it). The response times could be better but not bad by any meansCons:1. Uneven brightness: On a pure black screen with the monitor on, in a dark room, you can see the backlight is quite uneven. This does not happen on my macbook. But upon digging through Reddit and other forums, I gathered that this is common with budget monitors. And it is not noticable in general use cases. But it's definitely average in this regard.2. HDR: This is just a feature thrown in for marketing. There is no advantage to having HDR on or off and in a lot of cases, it's probably better off. HDR 400 ~= no HDR. If you need great HDR, HDR 600 is where you start seeing a little difference and HDR 1000 is where it's obvious. Don't buy monitors for HDR when they say it's HDR 400."
5,"Before this I have used two LG monitors - 27GL650F and 27UK650.Problem with full HD 27GL650F was up close the text and image look pixelated and because of it display didn't look smooth. Made me realize full HD may not look the best on a 27"" display. The 4k 27UK650 was sharp, clear and so smooth even at half a feet. Couldn't make out even a single pixel but practically didn't find it worth it. Good for Videos, but not appropriate for development work since most normal people don't consume content in 4k and my GC (3060ti) was struggling to get over 60 fps at high settings.Anyway, I read all the reviews and did my own research. Not pros and cons but rather few facts I observed about this monitor  -- QHD seem perfect resolution for 27"". Can't make out the pixels in text and display is so smooth. Sits just below 4k display clarity- Colors are vibrant, seem accurate and pop out. Much better than display of 27GL650F and very close to 27UK650- Menu navigation is simple and easy- 4 USB ports helps a lot. Didn't notice any delays when connecting keyboard and mouse to it.- Speaker is decent and better than having none like on 27GL650F and 27UK650- SDR Brightness is less, even at peak brightness it is no where near the level of both LG's. HDR brightness is just average. But this was fine for me. People who like or need too bright display may have to reconsider. If at night time I had to reduce brightness of LG's to 25-30% then for this monitor its 60% so you can get an Idea. Still looks fine under outside light in daytime, matte screen helps too.- HDR seems useless at least in gaming. Colors were washed out and dull in far cry 5 so had to turn it off. Consider HDR 400 as a specification on paper.- Better ergonomics. The way stand is designed and works makes it so easy to handle (definitely better than LG's)- bezels are so slim that display sometime feel like small for a 27"". Not so flat from back side.- Played few games, response time seem good- The first and biggest inconvenience you will notice will be the power cable, Not sure why they included a bigger 16amp plug. Have to buy a 16 amp to 6 amp converter or a new power cable. So that maybe extra INR 300 investment to make it work.- The original power cable is 1.8 meter and power adapter is inbuilt, so that's quite good and less clutter.- Didn't find any dead pixel and it had usual IPS glow, nothing out of the ordinary. If I don't feel the light bleed under normal usage I don't go crazy over the bright corners under black display and taking snap from phone make it look much worse then it actually is.- Import month was Jul 2021.- Ports are a bit underneath so takes some effort. But looks clean from back side. Two usb port on sides are very convenient. Got only HDMI cable in box.- Build quality is good, specially the stand. Very easy to setup.So, Overall I would say a very good candidate for QHD 144hz display in this price range. I really liked it for its color and vibrant display, ergonomics, usb hub feature, Inbuilt adapter & speaker, slim bezels. Watch out for brightness and the power cable. Don't take it seriously for HDR usage."

5,"Edit on product review....🥸1st one was bought from ( GROW MORE DEALS) Thought, worst buy of all as packaging was tempered if i compare with my re-buy from (Appario Limited).(Grow More Deals) Acer predator xb273k box was total sealed with foam wrap on box but monitor was defective inside. There was no sealing tape on box and box had dust on it and i mean real dust as taken out after years... Took me a week to get the product and another week to send by my side, even  paying shipping fee from my side, they even took 10% out from refund for Restock.. WTFun(Appario Limited) Acer predator xb273k monitor came in 2 days time with no extra packaging but box had seal tape of acer. I was afraid of getting another something bad one... But to my surprise the monitor was bang good, everything is great working with no issue.Difference...Well 1st buy was 8k lower in price so i can say they might selling refurbished (GMD) 🤣..Then the box wasn't sealed on 1st buy... And with extra dust as bonus😅Next thing i saw was instructions manual was in open packet in 1st box whereas in re-buy it was in sealed pack even the charging cable was in seperate packs not together as was in 1st buy😒Many coverings on monitor legs were missing and face cover was torn from middle in 1st buy when compared to re-buy😞Lastly was extra protection as monitor neck foam, termacol base in box for monitor stand, and plastic covers on both side of box hand grips were all missing in 1st buy.. ConclusionNo More Grow More Deals... 😵But 5 star on buy from Appario.. Satisfied with product"
5,"This monitor maintains the perfect balance between gaming performance and content creation. With VBR enabled it provides 1ms response time. Also has 10-bit colour depth, vhich is really usefull for better video quality. Also, as it is factory calibrated the colours are straight up perfect out of the box. However the downside is the downside (only for pure gaming performance) is that, because it has IPS panel ( which is actually great for content creation) it sometimes has slow response time and also shadowing. Overall it is the perfect mid range 1440p 144hz monitor. And also one should know that HDR400 really does not make much of a difference at 250nits brightness, HDR really shines at 1000nits+. However this panel is G-SYNC compatible(not certified), which means no screen tearing.But, in the end the 1440p 144hz IPS panel gives, sharpness, speed and quality all at a justified price."
1,"At this price, it's probably only Acer who's giving these specifications (1440p, 144Hz). And I guess the way they're able to do this is thanks to abysmal quality control.I initially received the original unit, which had at least 10 dead pixels. Immediately asked for a replacement, and the Amazon tech specialist was happy to oblige after checking the pictures.Received the replacement unit after almost 5 days, and that also had the same issue. At this point, I was so furious with Acer that I just initiated a return pickup and placed the order for an LG Ultragear 27GL850.It could just be my luck, or it could be that the seller was trying to push out defective units somehow. Either way, this has wiped all trust I had in Acer products."
5,"Seller: XtronicsappPanel has 0 defects, Backlight bleed is negligible and no dead pixels on arrival. Has a height adjustable stand that is sturdy (I am not using a mount so can confirm), colors are crisp af!"
2,"I wish I had seen Polarstar's review( 9th May )  before buying this monitor because while the product reviews had it bright and vibrant, what I got was a very yellow-tinted, very low-brightness monitor.Searching around the internet, it seems to be a widespread issue for recent buyers. It's especially noticeable to people who had already bought this monitor before late 2020 and then bought one recently. Mine was manufactured in Nov. 2020.Apparently, Acer have changed the panel on this model and while the new panel looks to be better for gaming(faster pixel response times), the picture quality is very different with very low brightness and whites being yellow and blacks looking slightly greenish.I have it alongside LG's nanoIPS 27GL850 which costs substantially more than this monitor because it had the best pixel response times for an IPS monitor. The Acer monitor seems to keep up with the LG when it comes to fast-paced FPS games, but the picture quality looks absolutely dismal in comparison. Bright day on LG looks like overcast on Acer, and that's before you notice the strange colors due to the yellow-tint on it.I'd suggest to keep away from this monitor if you want the monitor that originally came out a couple of years before and was reviewed as such."
5,"Upgrading from 24inch 1080p to 27inch 1440p feels huge. Great display with good colors. A great IPS gaming display under 25k but i got it in 21k which is superb for 2k 144hz ips monitor. One thing i notice that in SDR mode the display brightness not looks that high. Its little lower then my old lg 24mp88 monitor. But in HDR mode you get good brightness  and colors feels amazing. One minor issue i notice the display gets pretty warm near the acer branding, i think their is very little gap between internal power supply and display. Manufacturer should fix this one issue. Thanks."
3,"Received the product with no USB ports!!The ports were empty i.e. the manufacturers forgot to put the usb ports.M happy as I got a replacement but it was 4 days late as per scheduled day.Product is great.ISSUES:- When in dark , LCD light bleeding occures, can't complain as LCD with thin bezels have this issue predominantly.- Brightness can't be much reduced... At night the lowest brightness feels like it's at 50% brightness... for this issue What I do is I turn on the reading mode with lowest brightness this kind of solves the issue of brightness at Night.- Made in ChinaGreat product overall for this price."
2,The product is good but I had to pay 24k and now in just 6-7 days its 19k. What's with that?
3,"I chose monitor over the Acer VG271 because of its mentioned that XV has better panel, color accuracy and ergonomic option thinking it'd worth my extra 5k but I was wrong as per the side by side comparison with my BenQ ew2775zh (FHD 60hz) which is a regular monitor I was extremely disappointed by Acer's panel and color accuracy.. its very dull in blackness, but fine in bright colors, the viewing angle mentioned are 178 degree but its almost like a TN panel. You don't even get to see anything same if you compare the colors from center to corner of the screen.This monitor is a charm solely for gamers and media consumers, 144hz makes things extremely smooth even the little things like scrolling and mouse pointer movement makes a HUGE improvement in smoothness.Compared to my 13k BenQ monitor I expected Acer to show atleast decent colors since my BenQ mon is not a designer or creative's choice its just a regular cheap monitor that gets things done so it was a shock for me to see my 13k mon outperform this 30k monitor in color accuracy, viewing angle and in light bleeding.I'd say don't choose this monitor if you are not going to use the ergonomics much you can easily find a vesa under 2.5k and attach it to Acer VG271 otherwise if you don't mind spending extra 5k and keep things simple go for this.Decent for gaming, 100% not recommend for creative work."
5,"This is great 2k monitor for less than 25k price range. Picture quality is very sharp and colors are accurate as this is pre callibrate monitor. Panel is bright, even at 50% p rightness it feel very bright in normal lighting condition. Text is very sharp even viewing from close distance doesn't feel distorted. I didn't noticed any major back light bleeding whit my unit. To get 144hzd you must connect it to display port with display port 1.4 cable (which you need to buy separately and), also for better experience good to have HDMI 2.2 cable. Monitor is heavy and stand is firm but wobbles when you try to adjust monitor tilt, so make sure you have sturdy table. Overall this is best monitor for gaming, office work, programming, photo n video editing. Go for it."
5,"I'm not a gamer but I'm sure my son will use it for that soon. As a developer and Linux admin and user I think i'll keep it in a consistent vertical position because being able to see the entirety of a website or full length of the code i'm working on or even the full length of a linux update or script run. Scrolling has been minimized to almost nothing. - Such a beautiful thing. And the 4 port usb 3 hub was a big plus.Tip - when you go to turn the monitor vertical, you'll need to tilt it back a bit because it's too tall for the base."
5,Very nice product. Best value-for-money gaming monitor. Gives a tough fight to 40-50k monitors as well. Colour reproduction is fantastic. Sadly my laptop outputs quad hd @ 60hz :( But still sharpness is mindblowing. Every bit worth the price. Pics attached.Only con is that the speakers are really bad. The thinness of monitors nowadays means manufacturers can't attach proper speakers to them. Acer should have included at least a decent one with such a beautiful panel.😍😍🥰👍🏻 Overall highly recommended. Pls hit helpful button if you found it helpful.Edit: Scaling output gives 120 Hz via HDMI. Images much smoother as well as crisp now.
1,"I bought this monitor in april.and i have 6800 for GPU.from the day one once i plugged it in,I have been seeing flickering lines if i choose referesh rate 122/144hz.1st i thought okay may be i need 16A power cord so i got that still the same issue'sthen i though okay may be i need a better DP so i got gold plated 8k monitor 120Hz supporting DP,Still the same issue.so at this point i searched on reddit for it and sure enough ppl have reported pannel issues with this model and advised not to buy it.SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 120HZ OR 144HZ 2K IPS DISPLAY,THIS IS NOT THE ONE."
4,"Its says what it is nothing more. 144@IPS 8Bit+FCR=10Bit Monitor with HDR 400 . However to use it properly calibration of Gamma is required. Because default gamma makes is stupidly dark.This could be the reason many says it has terrible black light uniformity. Because by default Gamma is set to 2.4. If you set it to 2.0 from settings and you are golden. 2.4 gamma is for Apple retina displays, why acer chose to put 2.4 as default for this monitor is either naïve or a firmware bug. Secondly If you want to enjoy HDR go buy an HDR TV not this.Brightness is less adjustable so mind that.Buy if its specs suits ur needs. Otherwise Asus or LG if you have enough cash to burn.$$"
4,"On my first order, I got a monitor with a defective speaker but the panel was good with no backlight bleed and minimal IPS glow. I then sent it for replacement and ordered a new one but this one has minimal backlight bleed but speakers are working fine. Going to keep this one since the seller has now increased the price also and I can live with the minimal BLB."
4,"I give 4 out of 5 stars to this product (Acer Nitro XV 27U). But why?? first of all the colour accuracy of this monitor is beyond my expectations... The colours look on this monitor is just perfect. A 27 inch huge display with 2k resolution (support upto 4k, not recommended) and HDR400 support makes it a true pleasure to use. But  it has a major issue...its about it brightness. When I use this monitor any mode (I.e. SDR, ECO,GAMING or else) other than Hdr400 or auto mode, the screen brightness is down to very low even when brightness is set at 100.It is really very disappointing. But when you set the screen setting at auto with windows hdr mode on then all the problems are solved.I donot know whether it is a technical faulte or company makes it as it is?? The gaming experience on this monitor is very enjoyable (no issue with that). It supports 120 Hz with hdmi cable at 1080 p and 60 Hz at 2k resolution (this may be for my graphics card which is gtx 750 Ti). Overall it is a very recommendable product(price to performance ratio).Go for it as all I can say."
3,Product is great. 27 inch 1080p IPS display with 165Hz HDR at a price of 24-25K rupees. Product handling wasn't good. The packaging was damaged.Thankfully product is safe and is very good.Helpful advice: This monitor comes with a HDMI 2.0 cable and it is capable of outputting 165Hz 1080p with it.
5,I bought this after using acer gaming monitor. I can tell you this monitor is a bliss . Hdr is awesome and the ips panel is amazing. No lag on gaming. Perfect for gamers and creative use. Benq monitors are easy on eyes too. Less strain is always better. Do not hesitate. Go for it. Worth a buy.
5,"Go for it.. it's a great monitor, with great picture quality. You won't be disappointed. Benq monitors delivers great quality. Don't expect too much sound from the inbuilt speakers."
5,just got major upgrade from 19 inch to 27 inch...superb build quality
5,Good for work and gaming
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"Well, my review is basis the feedback that I have received from my brother (who is an ardent gamer) for whom I had purchased this monitor. I bought it after a pretty thorough research and I read a lot of international reviews which helped me take this decision in favour of this particular gaming monitor from BenQ. Happy about this purchase because I just got a call from my brother who was ecstatic about the monitor performance. He says that it has some fabulous features like preset game modes etc (rest I can't recall as I am not into gaming).All in all super glad with my purchase."
5,"It's amazing to go from 60 hz to 165 hz. I just bought it and I'm already in love with it. So far, it is the best in this segment in terms of smooth frames and awesome gameplay experience, with a nano ips 400 nits brightness. Overall, it was my best gameplay experience to date.Pros:+ Clear picture, very accurate colour.+ Viewing angle is more than perfect, and no colour will fade.+ Premium quality IPS Display.+ Solid build quality.+ Easily provide 165Hz with 1ms Refresh Rate.+ Adjustable Stand - tilt, pivot, and height adjustment are all supported.IF YOU HAVE THIS PRICE POINT IN MIND, JUST GO FOR IT, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER:)"
5,This latest launch from BenQ was highly awaited. Bought it as a rakhi gift for my gaming fanatic brother - and he absolutely loved it! Thanks to BenQ for finally launching it in India.
5,"""Upgraded myself from 75Hz to 165Hz monitor and take my word for it, you can feel the smoothness all over it. Best for console gaming with the speakers complementing the game. Panel quality is top notch.  And yeah, it is great for watching movies too.Aesthetically, I loved the borderless design and its backside has a great look which I like as it does not faces a wall in my room.  """
5,"Actually the main reasons to choose amoung many  was the third  party logistics provides xtronics.They delivered it with with proper packaging and along with handling guidelines and marking. 5star rating for the packaging. like many I was also concern about packaging and handling part ,personally I dont have  trust  on Amazon logistics.As it comes with  Va Display  can be suitable for regular purpose (It Fullfils mine - Stock Trading) , Not used for gaming so no idea about that,All pixels are working smoothly . No damaged product happy with over all experience.Using since  three weeks."
1,incorrect specs and false claim - Product and spec mismatch. The minister doesnot have an in build speaker but specs say it’s has inbuilt speaker. Please be aware of false claim.
5,Text is sharp and clear. Curve is amazing. 165hz with dp cable is really noticeable and works smooth and perfect. It's FHD but it's enough. Audio output is not strong. Overall monitor is perfect.
1,"This product come with Inbuilt Speaker, the speaker are not working. i have raised the issues with customer care , engineer visited my placed and confirmed that the monitor is faulty and need to replace that."
5,I bought it for technical analysis of stock market NT for gaming... For my purpose it's working perfectly fine...
2,Everything was working so smooth but after 30 min of uses.. the screen makes flicks. This is main drawback
5,"For the price this is the only available monitor with 165 hz, curved display that supports Display port and comes with wire for display port and hdmi both in the box"
5,"It's Only 120 Refresh Rate, Not 165Otherwise Monitor Build Quality is GoodDisplay All So Very GoodWorth Of Money"
5,Awesome!! Very good for wfh!!!
1,Broken Product Received
5,It is good more than expectation
4,GOOD
5,To good I write  review after fifteen  days  of purchase  really awesome 👌product.thank you Amazon.
1,"Highly pixelated display. Not suitable for official purposes.Also, refresh rate is not 165 as well.Not worth."
1,No service from company. They are neglecting their manufacturing defects
1,Video Player is loading.
4,"32 inch bit big , good monitor for content creators"
5,I am using it more than a week now. It met the expectation. But I believe 4k is more suitable in this size.
5,I think this is the best monitor
1,Dont buy this on amazon....theres no stand...and power supply and hdmi cables... waste of money
5,I am using for my work purpose. Its the best to beat many in its league.
5,Very much compatible with mac. Very satisfied
5,I would highly recommend this just go for it itz very big and wide
5,Very good and Quality product.. thanks to Amazon.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,There is no other monitor with VA Panel and 165 HZ and curved display at this rate of 19K.This is a steal deal. Go for it.
3,"I have 2 27inch 4Kmonitors, Samsung and LG.Samsung monitor is fine.The LG monitor, it doesnt support the wait. The hydraulics starts to slump and the monitror sits on the table.I think its a weight issue.I want to know if I can replace for a heavy duty model?"
5,"+ Very compact, declutters my desk+ I was able to make a small adapter to have the left-side VESA interface hold my laptop+ I separately bought a non-VESA adapter for my Samsung monitor+ Cable guides conceal the wires well.+ Good response gas springs for moving the laptop and monitor around- Load bearing is lower than 6.5 kg (my monitor weighs 5.7 kg, and is already overweighing the spring tension)- The surface area of the clamp is very low, so it scratches/indents the table surface. (I have added wooden pads both above and below the table between the table and the clamps to distribute load on the table better)"
5,"I researched quite a few dual-mount stands. I was looking for a stand that offered me flexibility to adjust along X, Y and Z axes. Based on my research, the Amazon Basics and Rife stands came up short in that regard.This stand is quite sturdy. The clamp into the desk feels secure. The monitors do not seem at risk of falling (I have a 24"" and a 22"" monitor).The stand has built-in cable management, so the desk looks clean and clear.Keep in mind: the monitors are screwed directly onto the arms rather than onto plates that are then inserted.The mount comes with instructions on how to install. However, I did not find videos online on how to setup. Those would have been helpful. E.g., I only realized by accident that the arms had built-in cable management.If you are looking for a dual mount that offers you the flexibility to tilt, swivel, rotate, bring closer, move higher, go for it. For quite some time I contemplated between this one and the Amazon basics mount. I'm glad I went for this one.I have no trouble recommending this mount."
5,"Before buying i was confused because of no reviews when i purchased, But now i am very happy with product and its quality.I have  27inch,  24inch monitor and its able to hold both of them easily.Movement are very smooth i can rotate, move up/down, left right with only one hand, also.Overall very nice product, i recommend to other also.Thank you"
5,"Does what it says on the label was impressed with the performance does hold a 27 inch monitor comfortably at any position and you can tighten it as well using the screwdrivwr that are provided by the company, really overall good experience in installation is quite easy"
4,love this monitor arm ..great quality
1,"The worst product, 5k for this crap don't buy it, horrible build quality, trust me it's the worst don't waste ur money on this crap."
5,I am really happy with the product quality & performance.
5,Easy to install. Hold the weight of heavy monitor and even my laptop. The arms are sturdy and I feel confident.I can easily adjust the monitor to my liking. Content 🙂
5,Easy to install..not much efforts required to Mount it...worth buying it.
5,"I got this in July so I have had about 3 months to try it out. I use it with two 24 inch monitors from Lenovo and it works just great.I keep moving the monitors around and the movement is smooth and easy. No problems there. I installed it on one table initially and then reinstalled it on another. Installation was easy.The cable management is amazing. Along with what I've done with the monitors, there's just one cable that comes out of the base clamp.The only thing I didn't like was the clamp itself. It should've had some sort of rubber/silicone thing to grip the table top better. It sometimes just slips around a bit. I might just drill a hole in the table and use the alternative clamping instead.Even with that, it's extremely sturdy, does everything it says it does and wasn't too hard on the pocket. Seems like a good buy, no regrets yet!"
5,"I got it for around 11.5K. At this price point it feels like a great competitor to Benq IPS monitor.PROS:--------------------Sturdy AF monitor stand:This ensures that the monitor is sturdy and minimizes the wobble. It has a better stand most of the other brands at this price point as they all offer plastic stand, the wobble from which would definitely be noticeably more. I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.-Good Picture quality:Out of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.I didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.-Thin Bezels:The bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.-Budget friendly:There are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point. Zebronics has definitely done a great job here.-Indian Company:Although this may sound really stupid but this was one of the reasons why I actually bought this monitor as I wanted to try something new, specially from an Indian brand and I am actually impressed. Hence this long review.-Included Aux cable:This may not be useful for everyone, but it was good to see someone include a aux cable out of the box since this monitor has a audio out port at the back.-Vesa Mount:Can't praise Zebronics any more at this point.CONS:-----------------Only available in white color:I feel this is mostly depends on personal preference. I personally prefer black monitors as watching media on them feels more immersive.-Buttons on the side:The adjustment buttons are available on the right-hand side of the monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup then you have to make sure that there is no other monitor on the right hand side of this monitor since that would hinder your ability to do any adjustments using the side panel buttons. This somewhat beats the purpose of a slim bezel monitor.-Only VGA included:Most of the modern devices have HDMI as the standard video output port. Zebronics could have included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA since HDMI is a better standard to use than a VGA. (they don't differ alot in terms of pricing).I fell this leads to decreasing the price difference between this monitor and some other monitors as they already have HDMI included out of the box (Benq) and you would have to buy a seperate HDMI cable with this one.-No monitor adjustment:I don't think there is any way to actually adjust the monitor but the more than sturdy monitor stand kind of makes up for this con.[PS: A great purchase and would definitely recommend this to my friends and family]"
1,"The main issue with this device1. It's not FHD or HD, this Delhi made local product.2. ""It has 500000:1 dynamic contrast ratio for deeper blacks, brighter whites and rich colours"" it's completely fake. It's not true. This device is unable to display black colour properly.3. Assembling: Bottom side screw not properly tight and screw hole is not on proper position.4. Power adapter: 100% Local5. Power Cable: 100% Local"
4,Pro :Big screenpremium lookcon :1. brightness light make stress on eye even you tried to downgrade the brightness. not sitting work have an issue2. inbuilt speaker very low. even not auditable if you want to listen anything voice.but i am satisfied with overall  performance.
5,"Reviewing after a month of use, 60Hz 1080p display with very slim design. Display brightness is also good, Not using for gamming. but you can have decent output for that as well. most importantly it has 27inch display, which is definitely better to look at.Only issue I found that if you have a poor electricity wiring or no earthing, display turns off for a while when switching fan/bulb on/off (happened only once, might be due to low voltage supply). Also if you accidently touch the pin of your charger (Type c or B any) to stand of the display (which is made of metal) then it flickers. Disappointing!!!Apart from this issue, I found the display very well, no issues further."
5,That's my 15.6 inch laptop next to this monitor. It's very helpful for my office tasks and also to watch HD movies. Although I had to replace the monitor on the very same day as it didn't turn on. But got the replacement the very next day so no complaints on that.
5,Best for working don't purchase for gaming but best for working value for money best buy for it professionals
5,"This is a superb monitor, with good quality and cheap price tag.  Picture quality is good. Speakers are little disappointment, but what else you could expect in such price. Packaging was very good and secure and delivery was timely as well. Overall it’s a best monitor in this price range. Go for it."
5,"I bought this 27"" inch zebronics monitor for trending purpose and I m very happy to buy this good looking monitor"
5,Everything was good but quality was not up to the MarkCons - no warranty card received 🥺
5,"I must say . The best monitor at this price . 27"" for 12 k is just mind-blowing .I hope this monitor stands the test of time."
5,Best in price. Quality is ok according to price.
5,Awesome and good looking
5,Best monitor
5,"Worth the money and good quality. The stand is a little wobbly, but except that it is really good."
5,Good product
5,Awesome product.
5,Amazing desktop for show off andbest design build quality and best brightness level amazing desktop after all very less bezel or you can say bezel less
4,"Just to give you the expectations, the one the seller deliver is different. this monitor does not allow to tilt it forward and backward like others in this price range. The speaker is just a namesake, even the mobile speaker sound better than this. I have never used this monitor speaker, its bad super low voice, no one can hear. the button for brightness and contrast adjustment is complicated to use.Best part, it looks good, takes less space, the overall quality is good"
5,I think price is slightly high but quality screen size and design all is look fabulous.
5,Display was quite good
5,the monitor is very awesome
5,Really like it
5,i suggest buy under 15000 rs is best led
5,Best monitor ever
4,"It is a white frame and white plastic body at backside. I prefer black only. But the LED tv is slim in size,  frameless are beauty and stand design is more attractive. It would be helpful if the seller spply a wall bracket and a HDMI cable instead of VGA cable which is outdated now days."
5,Super
5,nice picture
5,Sandaar i like superb
5,Nice
4,"Its entry level monitor, not 4k, disply quality is poor compered to top brand like Dell,zebronics failed to compete with dell, samsung, LG"
4,Using after 15days..my decision is correct.. Quality and price are really great and perfect suitable for photoshop and video editing ( my opinion)
4,"Pros :- Nice product , ultra-slimCons:- little tilted , no height adjustment"
3,"I would give 5 stars for looks but 3 stars for picture quality as images looks washed out, contrast is not that good. Another najor drawback is that there is no tilt adjustment which would have been fine if by default the monitor didn't point slightly in a downward direction. As u can see in the image I had to manually tilt it backwards to resolve this by putting some cushining below the stand, 2 cardboard pieces u can see at each end. If u r looking to wall mount then I dnt think this should matter as I am assuming that monitor won't tilt downwards then, but I can't say as I haven't wall mounted it. I did a lot of research before buying n thought of giving this indian brand a chance but since there is no option to return this product I have kept it otherwise I would have returned it. Dnt go for looks, go for picture quality and buy any other brand."
4,Good
4,"Amazing Product. Really worthy at this price Range, Overall is is Good.Inbuilt Sound can be Improve a Bit..its Too Low...Rest is Great"
2,"Valur for money except for aux issue but won't recommend buying.Audio aux port doesn't work.Replaced the product received in another week but for new monitor also audio aux port is not working.Most people doesn't test it.I don't know if it works at all or just for showcase.Tried with aux cable that was in box ,tried other aux , earphone as well."
5,Trust me if you are looking for a DECENT PICE AND QUALITY MONITOR I would proffer definitely  because I was really scared of the comments which I saw above but when I received the product I really loved it for the money what I have paid it is fine because you do get the same size monitor with higher price BUT THIS ONE IS DEFIANTLY WORTH OF BUYING IAM REALY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT FROM PACKING TO DELIVERY PERFECT.
4,Display complaint
3,"THIS IS 4TH DAY REVIEW AFTER PURCHASE, DONT PURCHASE BY SEEING SPEAKERS, VERY VERY POOR QUALITY WITH 100% VOLUME ALSO YOU CANNOT HEAR, VERY BAD PERFORMANCE.PICTURE QUALITY IS GOOD,LOOK WISE ALSO OK, VERY SLEEK."
2,"Its installation and setup on table as well as on the wall is very confusing. There is no space/screw...for wall mounting. I tried to buy a wall mount for this monitor but could find one anywhere. I also visited its service center in Nehru place (New Delhi), surprisingly they also do not have any idea about how I can wall mount this monitor. Other wise in terms of design and look it's a good monitor."
1,"I had bought S2218H and used that since last 3 years. The texts are very smooth in that as well the picture quality is Full HD.Now needed to upgrade and bought this one, But this monitor which is a successor of S2218H, is not anything as compared to the old version. The texts in this monitor looks grainy. You can't read texts properly when looking from near.I don't know why Dell made this, This has no Speakers, the image quality is also very low. Had to return it.I think Dell's ""S"" model is the best quality, ""SE"" are the cheaper and low quality ones."
5,"Value for money.So Crisp in display.I used it as my daily monitor. I had CRT monitor so initially I connected this monitor using  a VGA Cable but then there was distortion present and the pic quality was low as well.So, I have added a basic Graphics card and using HDMI cable which got free with this monitor the display quality I got was far better.Its stylish and easy to assemble.Value for money, but before buying it make sure you have graphics card on your system."
1,Guys don't buy this monitor colour reproduction is average... just Go for Lg 22mp68vq which have superb colour quality. I returned this and bought lg monitor!!!
2,Who gives a power cord with a 15 ampere plug for a monitor?  All computer essentials come with 6 amp plugs.  What is wrong wiwtth Dell?  And Amazon won't even take it back!  So I'm stuck with a useless monitor until I find a 6 ampere power cord in these lockdown times!
5,The monitor is quite good and can be used as an additional screen along side laptop especially for people working from home.
4,Worth every penny. Too happy with the results. Only pathetic thing was that the dell box was damaged not sure if seal was tempered or what.So 2 star for packaging
5,"Sleek and handy, picture quality is very good"
5,Love it - very good for the price point - Dell as expected does the job
5,I think I have invested in a good product. Hope it will work for a long time.
5,"Awesome productValue for moneyAnd must buy product 👍👍👍This monitor is Very OP, The display was very good and it was handled to me with all the care. So I'm giving this monitor 5/5!"
4,Nixe screen and good color accuracy for photoshop. But crays are visible as lines(pixilated).this is best for watching movies and playing games like gta_V.
4,Provided 15 amp power cable which is problematic while connecting with two/three more sockets to work the PC. Not so good but it's ok.
2,Just Ok. Picture Quality is not satisfactory. Text on screen appears hazy. Not recommended. Better to go for S2218H. Feel cheated.
1,"This monitor is supplied with 16 amps cord, as if people use this monitor in kitchen or bathroom"
1,Sending defective items and doesn't care to replace or refund.You have to call them and call will be continued to 7-8 days and so on but you will not get refund or replacement
5,I use the monitor to work on my laptop. It has made my working on Laptop easier. Specially working on Autocad has become much easier.
5,Clear good size and value for money.
1,I GOT OLD STOCK AND DAMEGED LED
4,"Product is really good. Prices keep changing. Description said ultra thin,  I expected it more slimmer than it is."
5,Good monitor
5,"Some reviews say that picture is not proper, etc.. I think this could be related to problem with vga cable."
4,PICTURE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD
5,Using it for a few months now. Worth every penny. Best part is the matt finish. Helpa reduce stress on the eye
5,I cannot recommend the product enough. I got it for a very reasonable price as compared to china made products. GO FOR IT.
1,First time trying to setup a monitor and found that only half screen is displayed. I will appreciate help with an immediate replacement.
5,Good
1,Comes with bigger 15 Amp power cord.
5,Clear picture and eye friendly . Dell name is enough for quality
5,Over all worth for our money
5,"My first IPS Gaming monitor, worth every single pennyWith this being a newly launched monitor, and with no reviews available, I took the plunge and purchased this monitor. And what a reward it has been! It’s been early days, but I have no regrets whatsoever. Since this has been worth it, I shall leave a detailed review here so it can help future buyers.1. First things first: IPS Gaming with G-Sync compatibility! These are the two main points that won me over. The colours are great on this monitor, and the G-Sync compatibility ensures no tearing at 144 Hz. Now, I’m more of an FPS guy. I’ve played CSGO and Call of Duty with this, and it’s been a superb experience.2. Tilt and Height Adjustable :  A big plus of this monitor has been the height adjustable option. Now I’m a programmer during a day, and I spend large hours of my time glued to the screen. This height adjustable option is great from an ergonomic point of view. Less eye and neck strain for me.3. Display Port and cable: You’ll get a display cable with this monitor, which ensures that you get the most out of this monitor in terms of refresh rates.4. Build Quality: The stand is sturdy, and doesn’t wobble. It has a really cool look with the Legion Blue colour that glows at night.  Pretty classy design in my opinion.Other cool things about this monitor are 400 nits brightness and the Anti-glare feature, which when coupled with the colour quality of the IPS panel, is easy on the eyes. The picture quality is sharp. I’ve read that Lenovo’s coming out with a 1440p variant of this monitor a G27q-20, but I’ve yet to see it here. So I purchased this one, and I’m more than happy with my purchase. An investment well made, indeed! The only thing I was disappointed with was the time it took to arrive, which was bit more than expected. However, it's understandable with the lockdown and my super high expectations of an Amazon fulfilled delivery !"
1,"I had to get the initial order replaced because of screen bleeding. But the replaced moniter seemed like someone already used it. I should highlight the poor packing and beware the seller doesn't include the serial number of the product with invoice. Because of this , I couldn't claim 2 years additional warranty as they claimed in the poster uploaded with the product details. Overall I had to get the 2nd product also returned as it also has bleeding issue. Not sure if it is a manufacturing defect or because of poor packing by seller. Also , when I tried registering it online, details were already in system with usage started 1 month back."
5,"Monitor has worked out well so far. My unit came with a Display Port cable. Luckily I had a DP port but not many folks would have it - and so then they would have to buy a converter/adapter cable to convert Display Port to either HDMI or VGA depending on their computer.The low blue light feature is awesome. I now use the monitor permanently in low blue light mode.I also like the height adjustability, very smooth and easy."
5,"The product has good support with my XSX, everything works well. Screen quality is also pretty good for the price."
1,"The product's warrenty is showing as expired when I registered it on lenovo site. And the pannel is damaged at few places, showing off bright spots."
1,"It's amdfreesync not g-sync the title is misleadingThe screen bleeds all sides, unable to see black clearly tried different settings and modes nothing works"
4,"For 27k price, it is G Sync compatible IPS QHD panel with HDR support(just minimum to call HDR though). Video Quality is good in default colour callibration. G Sync is working fine. Little bit backlight bleed at max brightness in HDR on. Good thing is it supports displayport 1.4 and you get the cable as well. So HDR + 165Hz + G Sync with displayport itself. At 165 Hz you get 8 bit colour depth option only. At and below 120 Hz 10 bit colour option is available in HDR on. HDR 400 spec is just to increase the price though. 5 buttons on backside to navigate the menu is not good. Also the bottom left side on the back of the screen gets heated in HDR at max brightness."
4,"This monitor is great for gaming with g sync compatibility and 99 per srgb,82 per NTSE, 83 per dci-p3 colours look's awesome but there downfall for this there is backlight bleed but it is common in IPS panel . Overall it is great monitor"
1,Product is probably damaged and screen is unusable. I couldn't check the product immediately after delivery and now it is out of return window.
5,"I had to make a replacement order because my unit has a few dead pixels. The replaced unit has no such issue and respectable screen bleed. Screen bleed is inevitable in IPS panels but if you are really lucky then you might not have any screen bleed. HDR works but the quality is just mediocre. The low blue light feature is a bonus. The lowest brightness settings is okay during day time but at night it is not that low so I use a third party application (CareUeyesLite) to lower the brightness even more and it works for me. Download the Lenovo Display Control Center from Microsoft Store for further customization. One thing I need to clear is that it is G-Sync Compatible only through Display port and not HDMI port as I have tested both.Overall, the high refresh rate is just awesome and the viewing angle is great as it is IPS."
5,"After a months of search, finally I decided to go with this monitor and I am extremely happy with the product. I was confused with LG Ultra gear with cost approx 22k & Acer approx 18k but both were having some or the other issues. And I got to know about this monitor and was satisfied as it has all i need. It is a newly launched product (march 21). For Gaming, editing, or whatever you want to do you can easily do on it. The colour grading are wonderful, no dead pixel, no bleeding. And I got an extended warranty for 1+2=3 years with just paying 300 bucks extra. It comes with dp cable and power cord so I purchased hdmi separately as my laptop don't have dp port. With hdmi I only get 60fps & I think with dp port it can go up to 144. The stand looks very sturdy and of very good metal quality. It can be easily tilted and even you can easily adjust the height. As this is my first monitor I am very much satisfied with product. I recommend 💯"
1,Lacks Upstream USB Ports. 5 button control at back Is pain specially if u want to switch from Game to Paper to Movie to multimedia modes. No such preprogrammed mode accessible at touch of a button. Nightmare to flip through multiple menus for changing settings. Will return just due to illogical controls
1,"After couple of weeks, I see a dead pixels or black patch on center of the screen. I tried reaching lenovo support immediately, they have closed the ticked without even acknowledging. Tried again to raise another request to escalate the issue but they asked me to visit lenovo service center and the issue is not under warranty. Strongly recommend to avoid purchasing lenovo display, unless you have time and money to waste on it."
4,At first was confused weather to buy television or a monitor looking at the specs and the pricing i just bought it. Overall its a great monitor if your preference is more towards entertainment or gaming then just go with this monitor colours are acurate. HD content on this monitor feels like 4k. I don't know how lenovo have priced very aggressive even in these days. Overall Im happy with this monitor. A full review is on my channel.
4,Awesome thing for its price! I use it for programming. Works greatly!Ratings for-Programming: 11/10Gaming: 11/10Reading: 8/10 (lacks text sharpness)Color: 11/10
5,The picture quality and the colours on this are great! The stand is very stable and the height and pivot adjustment are a welcome addition to the design. I did have some initial problems when using a hdmi cable to connect my laptop to the monitor however. The screen would randomly turn off and on and flicker. But the problem was solved when I used a mini DP cable. The size of the screen is perfect for gaming and creative content/designing. Good value for money!
3,"had to buy hdmi 2.0 separately because of the faulty description, I hadn't ordered it separately."
4,This monitor has a decent panel. It's HDR is bad. Very bad backlight bleeds and IPS glows. Which is a common IPS panel issues. If you're looking for a decent gaming monitor and can live with backlight bleeds. Go for it. I also recommend you take a look at Gigabyte M27Q and Gigabyte G27Q.
4,"The monitor was perfect, everything is working good only issue was that the box was torn from the sides and some of the sealing tape was broken as well. There was very little light bleeding in the corners when the screen was pitch black. Other than that the monitor is perfect 144hz, 1 MS response time, HDR and G-Sync as well."
5,The monitor is perfect is you want to spend less than 40k for 144hz 4kYou get 4k or 144hz below 40k monitorsAnd this one shines the most
2,"Monitor is good but when you buy below need to consider.1. No Hdmi cabal provided with monitor.2. Will get only display cabal and power card.3. Monitor stand takes lot of space, if your desk is small then not recommend.3.No speakers.4. Single HDMI port only.5.very limited hight adjustable not sufficient.Not recommend to buy this monitor, check for other options on amazon."
1,"It does have pixelation issue due to its 27inch panel and having only FullHD. Many people said that this issue can be ignored, but I can't. Also it is falsely advertised having G-Sync, this monitor doesn't have G-Sync"
4,"Excellent monitor for the money.Don't have much to complain about.The hardware button placement is awkward and not easy to use.Is mislabeled as gsync compataible, but is freesync compatible instead."
5,This is a good one for gamers out there who are looking for good picture quality with brightness and clear graphics... The monitor size is the best part
3,1 the picture quality in not good even though it is ips2 yes there is screen  bleeding3 the worst part is it has two inputs then to it cannot switch between two port i have to remove one input to use another
5,yes it has screen bleeding issue..but trust me if you buy this for gaming and for entertainment purpose it fulfilled you expectations....
5,Good monitor for daily office use
2,has white light bleeding issue on both 1st order and replacementbut other than that it has super image quality
5,The main drawback are the physical buttons. Other than that the picture quality is crisp. It is HDR ready and comes with a display port cable. No issue so far.
4,"Overall a good monitor, screen looks great, has blacklight bleed issue on top and right side of the screen."
1,Everything is as expected but it's not Gsync compatible. It's falsely advertised. Be careful.
1,"Very bad picture quality,  no sharpness, poor darkness."
5,Bast
3,"I am reluctant to use this cover as the material is rougher than a gunny sack. With daily use, it would definitely leave scratches on the monitor.  To protect from dust, one have to compromise on scratches. A soft layer inside would've helped. Disappointing purchase."
4,Good enough for use. Design is bland. Serves the purpose
5,"Using since last 3 months, good quality and white colour has less visibility of dust. Perfectly fitting on my 24"" inch Benq monitor. Happy to have it."
4,"I am using this for my Dell 24"" monitor it is perfect fit."
5,"I have a dell 24inch, works like a charm."
5,Structured

3,First of all I ordered black and received brown. Second - Thickness is good but I didn't like the finishing. The edges are not stiched properly and it looks like used one. You can zoom the picture and figure out by yourself. Metal stand looks elegant but it's loose and it will fall apart in a month.Not worth 1500.  Returning it back.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,Not worth the money.
5,"The product was fairly simple to assemble. The packaging was good and kept the product safe during transit. If you’d like a rather simple yet sturdy stand for your monitor, go for this."
4,"Decent looking monitor stand. Assembly is easy and takes 2 min. Looks okay, build is good too. Have to check durability. Price is high for this. A local carpenter can do this in a third of the price."
4,"This product quality is ok ...4 starts....but the length is insufficient to keep any branded sound bar under this stand. Vendor must reconsider increasing the length at least 44cm. Its current length is 39.5 cm, so....1 star less."
5,Nice finish...easy to assemble. I use them as my studio monitor stand. Can hold upto 5 inch studio monitors very well.
3,"Good sturdy product, would have been better if there were rubber bases for the stand for table grip."
5,Great look and build quality
5,Best for monitors without a vesa mount! Got this one less than 1k
1,Received a damaged product
5,Good Quality Easy to assemble
5,UPDECOR Quad Monitor/Laptop stand provides an improved ergonomic solution in the office or home. It raises the laptop off the desk to suit the height of the user while creating additional space on the desk beneath the laptop stand. Highly recommended product and easy to install.
5,"All is good with this monitor except for the vertical adjustment that missed to see. When working with progressive specs, we have to tilt the neck a bit more upwards. This could be adjusted by having a table height of around 26 to 28 inches for a person of 5 ft tall. For a more taller person they may not feel the same problem mentioned here."
5,"I bought this for few reasons:1. Height adjustable - so that I don’t have to adjust (lower) my chair height and hurt my legs and knees. Monitor comes up to my eye level easily.2. Higher refresh rate so that display is smooth. I mean when I’m spending, might as well get a higher refresh rate.3. Curved screen so that my 9 hours a day PC work is easy on my eye. I use a lot of excel. My eyes started burning on prolonged laptop screen usage of excel or any other small font application.4. Dell as a brand. All my PC, laptop and peripherals are Dell. This has 3 years warranty (I verified by adding this monitor to my account after ownership transfer).5. I use it with my gaming laptop as well for GTA. Feels extremely dope. Great colours and brightness. I did a side by side comparison of same YouTube video with my work laptop, personal laptop, LED TV and this monitor. This monitor fared best.Overall very happy with this purchase. Will update this review over time if things change."
4,"Only downfall is that, there was no HDMI Cable along with it."
5,"Pros:1.Superb picture quality(FHD) and plays 4k videos without any distortion.2.Zero bezzels,slim and sturdy,anti-glare thus perfect for work from home3.75hz,4ms display in this price range, perfect for gaming as well4.a masterpiece from LenovoCons:1.Could have been given in-built speakers and USB port"
5,"If you need gaming, picture, editing , anti-glare(better than 60hz android TV) in low budget monitor fair enough big screen of 27 inches go for this . It has less colour saturation when compared to other in this price and size.Slimmer and borderless. Looks descent.Cons(does not matter):€€€ wish it would have more external ports to  avoid more mess€€€  Wish it would have inbuilt speakers with  an additional 1k but when you need  entertainment external speakers are  much better for any monitor or LED TV."
5,"This monitor is best for docking station and PC setup. I use it as a docking station to work from home as a software analyst and as a product photographer, both jobs require a large screen with sharp accuracy and this monitor meets the requirements for all my needs. And that 75 Hz is awesome for gaming too! Without a doubt its more than what you pay for."
1,"Its' just been 3 days since I got the monitor. It seems to work fine so far. My only real issue with this purchase was that they sent just a VGA cable with the monitor. VGA cable for god's sake!!!! I am not sure who in this day and age even has a VGA port on their laptop or desktop. I now have to spend extra to buy an adapter. Also, VGA quality is terrible in comparison to HDMI or displayport. I really expected better from Lenovo India."
5,"Being a Flipkart's plus customer.....recently I switch to Amazon.....Very unfortunately recieve faulty product..... Custom care service is brilliant , appreciate thier effort and immediately they replacing my monitor... Hopeful for Amazon's best service"
5,Overall value for money!!!
1,Messed up product. Returning back to seller.
5,Good product
3,Shaking so much
3,Though the monitor base is strong monitor is shaking
5,There is no issue with this monitor .Go for it .
5,"Good Quality, Nice Picture.(Surajit Saha)"
4,"I recently bought this monitor with the intention of having the below mentioned requirements:* Have VGA & HDMI input* Tilt facility* Wall mount option* Inbuilt speaker* On top of it, should be comparatively cheaper :-)I found all the above in this monitor except inbuilt speakerThe monitor comes with* Base stand* Power adapter for 240V* HDMI port* VGA port* Audio out portThe max resolution  that we get is 1366x768. it is sufficient for basic computer usage or surveillance monitor.This comes with Vesa wall mount screw options but no wall mount.I havent yet explored with the PIP features. will update the review once i explore more"
4,Very good in this price segment LG and HDMI port is very useful you can use as a TV from the setup box and you can use computer from the VGA port everything is fine but only the mistake is viewing angles are not fine very less using angle you are get some shade and different different colours from the ceiling from the left and right side of the view
5,LG 19 Inch LED Monitor - Asked Around & Everyone Recommended This For CCTV Useage - Budget Friendly.Been Using It For About A Month Basically For Our CCTV Security System (24x7 Always ON). No Problems Till Now. The Picture Quality Is OK & Its Seems Sturdy.
5,Okay product
5,In a budget of 5420rs
1,Very bad.....picture quality not good. Main thing is that if you view even at slight angles all are negative like picture. Please don't buy.
4,Decent monitor for basic office use for non multimedia applications. The viewing angle is limited as mentioned in most reviews and it's not a full HD screen.It came bundled with a hdmi cable and has an audio out jack to connect a speaker or headphones to listen to the sound sent to the hdmi cable. Sound quality is of flat response and hence useful only for basic listening.
5,I am a age old patron of LG products. But I haven't had an LG led PC monitor before because my LG CRT monitor is running for Last 15 years without any issues. Believe me or not but this is the truth. Now this monitor is being used for my daughter's PC which I have gifted her. Picture quality is superb having 3 modes of display with energy saving automatic power mode. It's a green eco friendly monitor having accurate sensors  built-in. Very sleek and modern in design and has reader modes to protect eyes . It has both HDMI & VGA inputs from PC so that playing games at 60 Hertz is all time favourite for my child.
5,"For 5k, fabulous HDMI supported screen. The set up took all of 30 seconds :) love it"
4,"I received a opened product and found a big scratch in the screen, good we now a days taking video while opening any package for our safety.. But amazon didn't asked any question and replaced it with a new one.Pros: Resolution, Refresh rate, qualityCons: Stand and look"
1,"1.They didn't send the main cable. Only HDMI was sent. This is callousness to core.2. The Warranty card did not have sellers' seal. It says without seal it is not valid. Again very disappointed.3. Invoice copy is damaged. It is torn to half and only one half is sent to me. This is outright ridiculous!Though the product was delivered very promptly and the monitor is functioning well with good display (display, the pi tire quality is good good but not excellent. I used my old LGmonitors power cable as they have not sent the cable.Now after just 1 and a half months all colors have become pale.Monitor looks like Blue tinted black and white monitor!!!!😐Worst product."
1,"Don't be fooled my fellow Indians. This product is cheap in quality as well as price.Points to note before buying:-1) You don't get a VGA cable. Only HDMI cable+power supply cable2) The monitor is ""LCD screen with LED backlights"". It's not full LED. So the white glow problems associated with LCD monitors exist with this product.3) In the monitor there was no ""LED"" written at the bottom-left of the monitor as shown in display picture4) It's 18.5 inches, not 19inches as mentioned in product title.5) No replacement. Only refund policy. It's weird. I contacted customer care, they told the same thing.6) The materials used for manufacturing is cheap(quite obvious with this price). Thus the whole thing feels clunky.7) I couldn't find the warranty papers. Sigh.DONT GET FOOLED BY THE LOW PRICE. ITS ALWAYS A TRADE-OFF."
1,"You'll feel like you are in 90's if you use this monitor...so it's for nostalgia and nothing else.Note that maximum resolution for this is 1366 x 768, which is NOT enough at all for a monitor of this size. I am having a hard time reading even Powerpoint text in it. At best, I might be able to watch a movie on it.The display is quite whitewashed...again, looks like a monitor from 90's.Also, note that you CAN'T return this item, you can only replace it.Overall, I am losing my faith on quality of recommendations on Amazon. They don't mean much it seems."
4,"Its cheap and not very good. I use it for work as a second monitor. I think the picture quality is bad, i am not tech savy, but the screen is bad.I bought it before the lockdown, i needed it to work from home. I am glad i did. But quality is bad.If you are looking for a make do second monitor, this is good. Overall, its okay."
5,"Received it on. Initially was confused to buy as I was looking for a cheaper alternative around 3 or 4k and found adcom 18.5 inch one as the best based on my research but the estimated date of delivery was showing after a week with no hdmi cable which would have costed me some 4400 Rs along with the hdmi cable. So, I decided to go with this as LG is a trusted brand and was slightly costlier and was delivered the next day. My laptop screen is not showing proper colors, So I needed an alternative.Talking about this monitor, I'm surprised with the picture quality, colors look really nice and it feels really good to look at it. It is light weight and the bezels are quite fine, it looks very modern for the price it is selling at.So, I'm completely satisfied with the product."
4,This monitor is good I can use both as my desktop and as a tv with my airtel hd dth via hdmi. Reason for not five stars is viewing angle is poor
2,I had to wait 5 days for this product to get delivered even though I am a prime customer. The built is cheap and the quality is ok but not as clear as 1080p. When i bought it I thought it was 1080p but the picture quality is much worse than that. Why did amazon mention HD monitor on the description and its not 1080p. Its 2019 and not 2009. HD these days means 1080p to a normal person
3,"Lg brand, hdmi input with audio jack and 3 year warranty so a good deal.Made this a small tv. On Hdmi with settop box and added speakers to the audio jack."
5,"Better than average product.  And yes i am pretty sure it will last for long,i still uses lg 18.5 lcd monitor for my desktop, for the past 10years n its working without any problems.I bought it for my friends sister. She's all happy with it."
4,"Had ordered to work as a second monitor for WFH. An HDMI cable is included in the box. In case your laptop/cpu does not have an HDMI port, you would need a connector. Monitor is good and was delivered properly by Amazon. Only issue (if it can be called as such) to note is the display resolution is 1366x768. While this works for general use, normal laptop screen resolutions are higher. So difference is noticable. Also windows screen apprears slightly bigger size on this resolution. Higher resolution monitors are available at higher price. So this is more of a cost vs benefit decision to make prior to purchase."
3,The product isgood . But built quality does not seem like LG. Seems cheap And switches to sleep mode very fast. Hope this is not a defect or my money is wasted.
1,The image is whitewashed. The images on the right bottom corner will super blown out by the backlight whereas everywhere else it's not Bright. This is a very very bad design. I just bought this monitor for occasional use but still doesn't serve the purpose. Garbage. And more over I am unable to return this junk. Just look at the black images I've uploaded
1,"I purchased this monitor on 28 the June 2020. When I connected with CPU, screen flickering issue noticed. But within a few days that screen changed to grey colour. By that time return policy date expired.Now I have given the monitor to the service centre and they told board complaint and needs to be replaced. They don't have any spare available with them.Now I feel that the seller might have given some refurbished product otherwise day I one onwards display flickering issue will not be there."
1,"Disappointed because of the display. It is whitewashed and the display colours change even from a slightly different viewing angle. This is a major issue, and I haven't found anythung yet. Didn't expect such a poor product from LG. This monitor doesn't look like an LED monitor, rather feels like an age old LCD display. My privious monitor had a better display than this one, actuslly most of the monitors these days have a good display. I am unsatisfied with the purchase."
5,This monitor can be used as TV as well as computer Monitor. HDMI to Set Top Box and VGA output to computer. One Head phone output available which can be used as speaker output from set top box(with HDMI cable). I like this product. Thank you Amazon for quick delivery and good quality product.
1,worst product I purchased this product on 21 May 2018 and warranty of this product is 3 years but screen is not working only I can hear voice with the help of speaker no use of monitor I want to return this product
2,"This may useful for traditional cpu, but not to connect with laptops. Resolution is very odd with laptops."
4,Nice monitor but windows 10 users must set your cpu picture size 60hz 1300x760. If it is not it won't be connect. For Windows 7 user no need to worry perfectly fine it will automatically adjusts. Thank you
4,"I bought this mainly for editing photos and playing games. a good color correction. If you are a programmer or a budget gamer, i highly recommend this monitor. Readers mode works like a charm when you feel tired working or reading for long time. screen size is perfect in this 19"" monitor. Saves space and do the work.Response time is good when playing online multiplayer games like dota 2 and counter strike. but for people looking for monitors highly for gaming, better look for 1ms response time when buying one.AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLEReally satisfied with this product!"
5,Initially the LED display looked rather too bright and I was afraid that it should not affect my eyes.  Though bright it is not sensitive to the eye; so no discomfort was experienced. I like it more than the previous displays I had.
4,"i searched several days in Amazon for a good monitor. Finally i selected this LG 19 M 38 HB model. 19 inches LCD not LED. When we look the picture in side angle  it looks like ghost film. when we sit before monitor and work on in a straight angle it looks fine. i am absolutely satisfied with this price. Easy to fix the stand. As per their description I received base stand, Power adapter, HDMI port, VGA port. I also received guarantee card. I satisfied every thing. This is a good product for my personal, household purpose. Thanks to Amazon and delivered personnel."
3,Average Product.You might a better product in means of screen resolution. Does not support even 1080p 4K videos.Product is not durable if not handled carefully. The side cover can break easily if the monitor fall down on your table.The stand is adjustable.Okay for office work.Not okay for HD movie experience or gaming.Good thing is that it has an audio jack which you can connect to an external speaker.
5,This is a very nice product received from amazon. Thank you very much for the same. My son enjoying drawing and colouring very much. The only thing is VGA cable is not available as HDMI cable is there.Thank you again Amazon for timely delivery.
2,"Don't buy if you want to do any of following on this monitor1. Watch Movies2. Graphics work3. Play Games4. Anything to do with images.The colour reproduction is horrible, the gamma is way off, so even the grays on normal monitor are washed out to white. So all your image colours are wrong, movies look weird.You have some presets which you can choose from, but all the preset only make the image look worse."
5,Overall a great monitor. Viewing range limited as from distance or angle looks blurred. But then you work always in front of monitor so no issues..
5,Execellent and super quality with hdmi and sound out put is working very nice. Use both  hdmi dish tv and vgi cable for desktop  2in1
5,"Hi everyone, I am writing this review after using for around one month. I think LG is the only company which is offering split screen feature although you have to install seperate software for that. Split screen feature is great only problem is if you are planning for split screen feature go for 32 inch or more since it looks so small in this."
4,Has a poorly designed power socket which resulted in intermittent power supply to the monitor. I had to return the initially supplied piece. Even the replacement has similar issues though to a lesser degree. Other features are satisfactory
3,It is difficult to configure the monitor with all buttons at the bottom and an unfriendly problematic interface
1,"I have purchased this monitor two times and returned, I feel the following in respect of this...(1) The resolution of this monitor is FHD which is not sufficient for any 27 inch monitor. if you want to buy 27 inch monitor its  resolution must be 2K or more than it.(2) The most annoying thing is that both time the monitor which i was received, It was already registered at DELL site for warranty and it was started 6 month before. Thanks to Amazon customer care for there quick support and help for returning this items.(3) I was facing eye strain and my eye became red due to long hour siting in front of it, It is not safe for eye also."
5,"Got this product 3 days back and has been using it since then it is amazing for my work, and the quality of picture quality is perfect, for this price range it fullfilled all my requirements like height adjustable monitor, rotation to max extent, only draw back i felt was if night light setting was inbuilt it would have been the best monitor, generally if you compare other brands for this price range u wont get a 27 inch monitor with these kind of features which just awestruck me, never felt bad after purchasing this producPros:1. Large screen easy to multitask2. best in price range and best quality3. Height adjustable & tilt functioncons1. Bezel to thick2. antiglare feature3. night ligth settingif your purpose is for office work this suits you i havent used it for other purpose so i cant comment on the refersh rate nor the gaming quality"
4,"I bought it as an additional monitor for work and so far it is good.I would have been more happy if rather than having one HDMI and one VGA ports, it had two HDMI instead. All laptops from around 2016 has HDMI only. [Then again not an insurmountable problem - there are HDMI switches for a work around]As of writing this review, I have not discovered/come across the perfect balance of display colour to my suiting. The colour profiles in the menu are  a bit yellowish (standard), more yellowish (comfort), slightly bluish (warm - which a bit seems odd) and custom (which is a bit difficult to balance)Over all it is a good monitor"
4,Good basic 27 inch IPS panel with height adjustment. Purchased for father to play online chess.
5,"1. Monitor comes with Power Cable + HDMI Cable.2. Picture Quality is very good.3. Sound Quality is good. But, not too loud. We cannot expect loud sounds from a monitor as well. Hence, it is okay for a monitor.Con:1. They have given 16AMP Plug Socket. So, this monitor requires 16AMP plug socket to connect and hence, plan accordingly before you buy."
5,I like it Raju don't like it
1,Chromecast is not supporting. No USB port and audio output. Only one hdmi and vga port
2,"THE MONITOR, EVEN AFTER FIXING IT TIGHT, KEEPS SHAKING BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, DINT LIKE IT, ITS AFFECTING MY EYES"
1,Buy led version.LCD in not good.
4,Monitor is good.
5,Product is good as described....... Worth to buy in this price
3,They sell defective products here.
5,Would've been better if it had an audio port too.
5,Realy good
4,Good
5,Very nice
1,This product is not made in India. Did not expect Amazon to provide wrong information in product details. In future will surely reduce my buying on Amazon
5,Entertainment and time for my own and small children age 5 and 8 years old who are now home because of corona
4,"Hi,Talking about the unique selling point (usp) of this monitor, its the response time.For gamingRemeber, a faster response time is not all a good gaming monitor needs, it does need higher refresh rate too, which this monitor lacks(75 hgz) which is still considered good at this price point though.Full HD LCD- Most monitors till date are LCD with LED/WLED(same) backlit.Its the panel which makes difference.3 panels found in monitors are IPS, VA, TNThis one have TN, which is cheapest among above 3 mentioned so its cost effective.TN have fastest response time but lack picture quality.This monitor is only for gaming or normal office/home browsing. Please avoid if anyone is looking for graphical, imaging, visual work."
5,Got it for gaming and video watching. I carry it with me when I'm traveling with my rig! The speakers were a good surprise! Been using them almost exclusively (no other speakers) but then I'm not very finicky about audio. The screen itself is the best I've had in a while.
4,"1. The monitor is as described in the Item description. Picture quality is good and the viewing angles are alright ( Used HDMi cable) .2. Easy Installation and It got delivered with the Indian Power cable , so there was no worries about plugging it straight away.3. Plenty of options to change the settings on this one and can be done with ease.I haven't played any games as i am yet to build my PC. Will review gaming performance post PC build.I had selected next day delivery for this monitor but there was some issue at Courier's end and wasn't delivery on the 1st day. So reducing 1 star for it."
3,"I really liked its vivid, vibrant colors. Coming from a Dell monitor, this felt glorious to my eyes in Mass Effect Andromeda. But the screen fonts are all very blurred and jagged and I couldn't fix that with Windows 10 ClearType adjustment. Text scaling settings did not help either. Tried installing its drivers from Asus website but Windows rejects them because apparently the drivers are not signed. Windows 10 (1903) does not have inbuilt drivers for it either and detects it as a Generic PnP display. Honestly, this is the first occasion in my 20 years of computing that I had to look for drivers for a monitor. And when I did look for them, I couldn't find one that works. But thankfully, I need this only for gaming and not for browsing or wordprocessor, so it doesn't matter to me.Worked perfectly for my PS4 too.Speakers: I connected this for PS4 on HDMI for gaming video and audio. But the speakers are very poor. Think of them as very loud headphones, very tinny. That's it. Even cheap ~Rs.500 desktop speakers work better than them and you can forget gaming on the inbuilt speakers."
4,"A great monitor for my ps4, pictures are crisp and clear, the colors in this monitor surpassed my expectations. I have been using this monitor for over 9 months, no problems found. Cool product"
4,"Very good for gaming. Zero lag with PS4 Pro. But, the details in the display cannot equal IPS Panels... But we have to sacrifice IPS for higher refresh rates."
5,Nice product Asus Go for it Works well competitive pricing
4,"I think the monitor is good but would have been better if:1. HDMI cable is included.2. better arrangement is available for the two cables at the rear ie are secured properly instead of being loose & open to damage.3 Its a fairly big monitor for a desktop & work. On a desk, better if it stays farthest from the eyes. A stand designed to keep it closest to the wall of the cubicle would help.4. There is scope of improvement in Audio quality.5. Gaming I have not tried. Response time is ok but do not how know the refresh rate works for this monitor.overall a good monitorOver all its good."
1,"Pro: Value for MoneyCons:1. Not a very friendly design, connecting hdmi and power is a task2. If it won't surprise when you wake up to a failed monitor and you are ok to go for another one.3. Finding a service center who can get the failed product service is like a huge task4. If at all you find one and call them, they say they only service laptops and not monitors.5. If you call one of the service centers, they make you feel that you may better throw it out of the window, than wasting time with these people. So reluctant people you will ever face."
5,Great display loud sound connected to HDMI.Only single cable is required for both sound and display there is a alternative for for audio of cable and video VGA but HDMI does both of the job great product Asus
5,Bought two of these to do a multi monitor setup. Super crisp fonts and contrast make it easy to code at low and bright light.
5,really good monitor but keep in mind it does not include hdmi cable so u may need to order one but leaving those its the best reallyt the best as 1ms response rate and 70hz approx. refresh rate and for using the speakers we need to join the aux cable which is included dont think it will work with joining only hdmi or vga cable
5,Good product for home use.
5,"Nice product, max refresh rate 75Hz when res is 1440x900 set in custom resolution. Don’t mess with other settings. Great value for money"
4,I use this screen for my office work and it serves the  purpose well. Good features defined.
5,Best Value TN Panel
5,"Amazing monitor, only issue is the angle view.. If u see it from any other angle except perpendicular, you wouldn't get perfect view"
5,Excellent monitor. Did the job. Great at its price point.
5,Awesome Product This Pictures Quality Superb & Easy To Installation & ASUS Product Is Performance Is Superb. THANK YOU AMAZON.
5,Value for money
3,Was fine for the first 3 months then it Stopped working. Now I am left with a non-functioning monitor.
5,better  for gaming moniter on this price.. response time as per mention... best for new and low budget gamer.
5,"Its been more than 3 month since i bought this, totally worth the price. No issues tillnow. I use it for playstation 4. Its just worth the price and the picture quality is brilliant. Highly recommended."
2,"Good for gaming, picture quality is also good., audio quality is not upto the mark and the stand of this monitor is not good the monitor shakes a lot even for a little tap"
4,"Monitor is good, but sound is not good enough,"
4,Awesome gaming experience. Good color from all directions. But some are pixelated due to 60hz. But it doesn't matter. I became a pro in csgo
3,There is no HDMI cable given
4,"Monitor speaker volume is very low u need an external speakers, else it's best product"
5,"I am completely satisfied with the product, I placed the order in night and it was delivered by next morning."
5,"I was looking for a high quality monitor for WFH setup with height adjustment and swivel. The height and tilt adjustment is very useful for long working hours where you keep changing sitting position, attend long calls. It is very relaxing to attend call while standing near desk. Also there is enough space if you up uplift the monitor to max height and keep laptop below it. The 2 screen will be like stack on each other. Earlier I was looking for model - P2219H, but it was out of stock. Then found P2222H  is better in look, boarder less design and 2021 year model. So I ordered it and highly satisfied for working needs. By the way Dell is my all time favorite brand from college days.  The 24 inch model is little bigger but my preference was 22 inch model. I mostly switch work with 14 inch laptop. So choosing for 22 inch monitor instead 24 is best as it brings down screen gap. One thing, there is no speaker in the monitor and it comes with 13 Amp plug. You may need to buy a 6 amp plug. There is HDMI VGA and Display port with USB hub.The 22 inch monitor have another advantage as it consume less power than 24 inch, I manged to run it almost 2 hour on my APC BACK UPS 600.It has 3 years onsite warranty."
5,"The product arrived on time as mentioned which I ordered on 29th Octfor Rs. 13699/-. I got an additional 10% discount when paid via Debit card which reduced the price to Rs. 12699/-. Inspite of some of minor cons I observed, the monitor is super useful for multitasking. The following are the pros and cons that I observed in this monitor:Pros:1. The monitor is height adjustable and also tilt able which gives a massive advantage for using it either for sitting or standing use.2. The clarity of the screen is top notch. I did have to adjust the brightness as it was too much initially. Monitorian app from windows helps in reducing the brightness of any connected display without any hassles.3. There is a  cavity for cable management which is a plus point.4. The stand feels sturdy as its metal built and is supportive.5. The monitor comes with a DP - DP cable, power cable (with a massive 16Amp plug needed for this) and a superspeed USB 3.0 Cable A Male to B Male Cable cord. To display content from PC/laptop to monitor, both Display-display cable (or VGA/HDMI cable if you have one) and the superspeed USB cable needs to be connected to the PC/laptop.6. The monitor comes with 3 USB slots(not sure how this helps), 1 Display Port slot, 1 HDMI slot, 1 VGA slot, 1 USB 3.0 Type B slot and a power cable connectivity slot. Thus, it has ample connectivity options.7. The monitor screen rotation feature is an advantage when you want to read documents/eBooks vertically leading to less scrolling. Also, useful for coding programs.8. The viewing angle is superb for everyday use. The screen size is pretty good which helps in multitasking.9. The 3 USB ports provided in the monitor are an added advantage in case if you need to connect your phone/pen drives/external HD/camera/other devices. It serves as a additional USB hub which I noticed later.Cons:1. The USB cable needs to be connected in addition to the Display port/HDMI/VGA cable which consumes an extra USB slot on PC/laptop to work with the monitor.2. It would have been better if the monitor came with a HDMI-HDMI cable instead of the Display port cable as most of the PC/laptops don't have a Display port out slot.3. The power plug is massive as mentioned in the images and thus it needs a 16Amp socket for it to work. It would have been better if it was the normal plug."
5,"Good:1. It is very easy to unbox and install. Took me half hour.2. Initial reviews said it came with only 16 amp plug. Mine came with both 16 amp and 6 amp plug, so kudos to Dell for taking customer reviews into consideration.3. Have not tried gaming. I am a techie, so mainly coding, reading mails and work relates stuff only I checked. More landscape to work on so hopefully will get things done quicker.4. Height adjustment is very nice.5. Anti glare works perfectly. No eye strain. See the 3rd pic showing the tubelight behind me giving more glare on laptop when compared to the monitor.6. Full brightness on the p2222h dell monitor is still easy on the eyes. My dell latitude 7420 came with very penetrating brightness which was a cause of eye strain, so had to remember to reduce it and increase it as per need everytime.7. It came with 2 cables for display (neither of which is hdmi to hdmi), which may come in handy later, though personally I have not yet seen that type used anywhereBad:Nothing. Only thing maybe that if urs is a newer gen office laptop then u may need hdmi to hdmi cable separately since I think only that would be supported by office new laptops."
5,would highly recommend this monitor. Built quality is top-notch. The height-adjustable stand is slightly big but otherwise has great colours and performance. IPS bleed is very minimal.

I initially wanted to go for a 4k display but the clarity on this is amazing enough, just make you don't mess with the settings unless you know what you're doing or else some features like ""Super Sharpness"" will add sharpness to parallel lines in applications like AutoCAD which will leave you blaming the monitor instead of yourself."
5,"The monitor is very calm on the eyes. Working long does not tire the eyes. The frame refresh rate is good and I am able to obtain close to 144 Hz at 1080p.

4,"Black is a little off , too much backlight when screen is filled majorly by black still cant complain given the budget. except that i am pretty happy with the product. No dp cable comes with the monitor only hdmi is provided so will have to buy that separately. 32inch is really too big if you are using it primarily for computing purpose. having used it now i feel i should have gone for 27inch. even for gaming 27inch or go for 34inch ultrawide rather than this since it is too big. it is awesome to play racing and fifa like games.. but action and shooting games wont be a strong point. Movie watching and media consumption is where it really strikes gold the picture quality is awesome colours are vibrant wouldnt missout on 2k since this monitor more than keep up in video playback. Speakers are just a feature to be listed on description list. I feel even high volume headphone might sound higher than 3W inbuilt speaker..will have to buy an extra speaker or use headphone.

5,"Acer ED322QR (black)- The product details doesn't clarify this but based in monitor settings and AMD Certification, do be advised that this is a FreeSync Premium and not the regular FreeSync model.This is a major plus for the price it is being sold. Apart from that on a budget this is a great VA Panel, does about 270nits, not too bright. The colors aren't so punchy or over saturated, also you need a dp 1.2 cable for the FreeSync Premium to work on Nvidia cards, remember to turn off the vsync while gaming.Also you can install the Acer display widget to control the picture modes, set vsync to specific applications, am not sure what's the use of split screen function though.One negative is that, you need to hold the joystick in the rear for 5 seconds to switch this off (who ever designed this, what were you guys thinking).For 16.5k this is an awesome buy tbh!"
5,"I was using Lenovo G530 for over 5 years now and it was becoming sluggish and erratic after 5 years of use.

I got a VGA to HDMI convertor but it did'nt work. I had no option but to get new monitor. I kept on browsing for several days and finally I shortlisted this Acer 32 Inch Full HD Monitor because I used to see huge monitors connected with macs in Apple store so I thought why not I should get a huge monitor too ?

I don't play games on laptop and don't watch movies etc (apart from short youtube videos) so I really don't care about the ultra clarity from a budget monitor. It was chekcing all the tick marks for me and I got it and I am pretty happy with it. Its working as its expected to. Looks hot when everyone sees it.

5,Its a great monitor the only 1 thing you need to remember is the socket  pin is bigger than normal so incase you are wanting to plug this to extension board you will  have to buy an additional 5x15 plug which will cost about 50 to 100 rs. Rest I don't see any cons in this

5,"Samsung Odyssey G7 is a great monitor for both gaming and watching movies and tv series.PROS: 👍1. 240hz2. 1440p resolution3. Gsync compatible4. VA panel (deep blacks are great)5. curved monitor, so you don't have to turn your head too much while sitting close. (no it doesn't feel too curved just right at the point)6. core lighting, puts less stress on your eyes in dark.7. the pixel density is about 109 PPI so it's obvious the text clarity will be good as well8. comes with two 3.0 USB slots, so you can plug your mouse and keyboard.9. It comes with HDR 600. movies, games, and series look great watching on HDR.CONS: 😌1. gets hot easily when HDR is on, you can feel the heat on your face, but having an ac room should fix that issue.2. THE PORTS ARE A NIGHTMARE TO REACH !! they are so hard to access, if you don't have a big table you'll struggle to find ports just by the feel of hands. what makes it super hard is they are not visible from the back or can be felt with a hand easily.3. Just HDR 600, HDR 600 isn't great but better than the fake HDR 400 certified monitors.4. core lighting isn't bright enough with half of the available colors so make sure to choose the bright color.5. most importantly, the stand is huge which might not an issue for big tables. i suggest a gas-powered VESA mount.6. Vulcan and HDR aren't compatible for some reason, your monitor will go blank and won't start without replugging the power cord.EXTRA: no dead pixel or any sort of faults in my unit, Bought it for 43500rs"
1,Grainy pictures and crushed blacks in dark scenes in movies or youtube videos.Good for gaming
3,"This monitor has the following issue (firmware 1011.0):When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is ON - Micro-stuttering in games when slow camera panning - like when you use a gamepad or controller to pan the scenery. This micro-stuttering is not present if ""VRR Control"" is switched OFF.When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is OFF - If frame rates go above 90 fps, then there is a lot of inverse ghosting. Cannot correct this inverse ghosting as ""Response Time"" is disabled during ""Adaptive Sync"" ON. Another issue is that even if you play 60 fps games, LFC engages at 72 fps, so a 60 fps game is actually running at 120 fps on the monitor which is in the ""inverse ghosting"" region. You can bring down the LFC lower boundary to 30 fps by CRU (see some reddit posts), so that 60 fps games do not get overshoot. But mind you at such low fps without LFC flickering issue can be seen."
5,The beast of all the Gaming monitors. You would fall in love with it and never want to go back to flat screens. The only competition it has is its G9 model which is way too expensive.G7 is the best thing you would love from your gaming rig and can fully utilize all the newest GPUs with this.It is a bit heavy but worth every penny.Kudos to SAMSUNG for this fantastic product.
5,"I use it an my daily driver for gaming, watching movies and create graphics design. The curve gives you a pretty good end to end viewing angle that makes you feel the display is all around you.Though it's price is high compared to other monitors available in the market, I'm satisfied with this product."
5,"Background:I have a decent gaming rig (RTX 3070) and was using a LG 32GK650F 32"" 1440p 144Hz VA panel with my setup. I mostly play FPS (CS, Valorant) but also occasionally play RTS (AOE2), AAA titles and consume a decent amount of video and browsing content as well. The main reasons for upgrading were: low pixel density of LG monitor (webpages and text looked awful), black smearing (I mostly use black backgrounds and boy the smearing was bad) and maybe size (found 32"" to be slightly big for FPS games).Other considerations:Considered many alternatives varying from 27"" 1440p to 32"" 4K monitors. Most of the 27"" 1440p monitors were limited to 144/165Hz and while it was not a deal breaker but it was inferior to 240 Hz anyways. I would have gone for 4K 144Hz monitors but then my RTX 3070 wouldn't be enough for 4K gaming. 280Hz/360Hz 1080p monitors were out of question because I don't play competitively at that level. HDR at this price range is just a marketing gimmick. You need atleast a 1000 nits panel with multiple local dimming arrays for a decent HDR experience. IMO HDR is mostly suited to OLED panels.IPS vs VA:Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 have the best VA panels in the world and are the fastest VA in the market beating even the top IPS panels. I mostly use black backgrounds and play in dark so VA were obviously a better choice with high contrast ratio and no IPS glow. The only thing that was bothering me was black smearing which luckily Samsung has done such a good job that it's on par with IPS panels. IPS do have better viewing angles but then again it wouldn't matter if it was a curved display in the first place. I don't share my screen so curved and slightly less viewing angles were ok with me.What's great:I got a decent panel with minimal backlight bleed, no dead pixels, no black smearing. Colours are far better than my previous LG monitor. Contrast and colours are great. Display is sharp and crisp and gets bright enough to use it in a well lit room. Out of the box display calibration was decent. Games look beatiful. The curve is aggressive and took me around a day to get used to and now I love it. I can keep the monitor close and focus on the center of screen (in FPS games) and still have field of vision in the corners. I use it on a DP 1.4 cable at 1440p 240Hz 10 bit (8bit+FRC).What's not so great:Size. The monitor is thick and the curve is to blame here. Make sure you have enough space on your desk. Secondly, the stand is just huge. It is very stable and offers every kind of adjustment but for a 27"" panel it is just plain huge. I use a monitor arm so that isn't an issue for me but it's something to keep in mind. Pricing is a hit or miss. Look for price cuts during sales. But comparing to other brands this is decently priced. Other brands like LG, Asus, Gigabyte has a huge difference in offshore and Indian pricing which I just consider plain cheating and greediness.Conclusion and recommendations: It's a great all rounder monitor albeit for a selected audience. It is highly recommended for someone who wants the best of both worlds (FPS+AAA gaming), prefers to use the monitor in the dark, isn't bothered by the curve, has enough space on desk or a monitor arm. Consumers who play eSports competetively should look for 1080p 280/360Hz monitors. And those who play on consoles or AAA games only should eye a 4K 144/120Hz display or OLED displays (especially for HDR). IPS panels for those who wants wider viewing angles and share screen and are not bothered by IPS glow and low contrast ratio. This is all from a gamer's perspective only as I don't use any productivity applications. Hope this helped you!"
5,"Everything i expected from this monitor, i got. I was skeptical at first since people mention flickering/stuttering issues, but my unit did not have those issues. 1440p 240hz at 10 bit color works fine with the included displayport cable since my 2070S has DP1.4 DSC support. No visible ghosting/smearing (regular or black level) and overshoot. HDR is pretty good with the max brightness of 600 nits and around 90% dcip3 and an upgrade over SDR (although not as good as my Galaxy Note 9, which is a self emissive display with 1000+ nits peak brightness and a wider color gamut).My only complaint is the VRR range of the monitor. Nvidia lists this monitor's range as 60 to 240hz, yet LFC seems to trigger as early as 90hz. If a game stays above or below 90fps, it's a non issue; but if a game moves constantly above and below 90fps, it's gonna be distracting since there's some stutter before the monitor moves in and out of LFC (This is evident for me when playing Doom eternal maxed out with rtx on). Not sure if this is from the monitor's side or nvidia's implementation of LFC on Freesync monitors."

These were the exact words mentioned by Raj N from Amazon leadership team.After multiple frustrating follow up with Samsung and seller I got money refunded.Thanks Seller for helping me with the refund
5,"Samsung Odyssey G7 is a great monitor for both gaming and watching movies and tv series.PROS: 👍1. 240hz2. 1440p resolution3. Gsync compatible4. VA panel (deep blacks are great)5. curved monitor, so you don't have to turn your head too much while sitting close. (no it doesn't feel too curved just right at the point)6. core lighting, puts less stress on your eyes in dark.7. the pixel density is about 109 PPI so it's obvious the text clarity will be good as well8. comes with two 3.0 USB slots, so you can plug your mouse and keyboard.9. It comes with HDR 600. movies, games, and series look great watching on HDR.CONS: 😌1. gets hot easily when HDR is on, you can feel the heat on your face, but having an ac room should fix that issue.2. THE PORTS ARE A NIGHTMARE TO REACH !! they are so hard to access, if you don't have a big table you'll struggle to find ports just by the feel of hands. what makes it super hard is they are not visible from the back or can be felt with a hand easily.3. Just HDR 600, HDR 600 isn't great but better than the fake HDR 400 certified monitors.4. core lighting isn't bright enough with half of the available colors so make sure to choose the bright color.5. most importantly, the stand is huge which might not an issue for big tables. i suggest a gas-powered VESA mount.6. Vulcan and HDR aren't compatible for some reason, your monitor will go blank and won't start without replugging the power cord.EXTRA: no dead pixel or any sort of faults in my unit, Bought it for 43500rs"
1,Grainy pictures and crushed blacks in dark scenes in movies or youtube videos.Good for gaming
3,"This monitor has the following issue (firmware 1011.0):When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is ON - Micro-stuttering in games when slow camera panning - like when you use a gamepad or controller to pan the scenery. This micro-stuttering is not present if ""VRR Control"" is switched OFF.When ""Adaptive Sync"" is ON and ""VRR Control"" is OFF - If frame rates go above 90 fps, then there is a lot of inverse ghosting. Cannot correct this inverse ghosting as ""Response Time"" is disabled during ""Adaptive Sync"" ON. Another issue is that even if you play 60 fps games, LFC engages at 72 fps, so a 60 fps game is actually running at 120 fps on the monitor which is in the ""inverse ghosting"" region. You can bring down the LFC lower boundary to 30 fps by CRU (see some reddit posts), so that 60 fps games do not get overshoot. But mind you at such low fps without LFC flickering issue can be seen."
5,The beast of all the Gaming monitors. You would fall in love with it and never want to go back to flat screens. The only competition it has is its G9 model which is way too expensive.G7 is the best thing you would love from your gaming rig and can fully utilize all the newest GPUs with this.It is a bit heavy but worth every penny.Kudos to SAMSUNG for this fantastic product.
5,"I use it an my daily driver for gaming, watching movies and create graphics design. The curve gives you a pretty good end to end viewing angle that makes you feel the display is all around you.Though it's price is high compared to other monitors available in the market, I'm satisfied with this product."
5,"Background:I have a decent gaming rig (RTX 3070) and was using a LG 32GK650F 32"" 1440p 144Hz VA panel with my setup. I mostly play FPS (CS, Valorant) but also occasionally play RTS (AOE2), AAA titles and consume a decent amount of video and browsing content as well. The main reasons for upgrading were: low pixel density of LG monitor (webpages and text looked awful), black smearing (I mostly use black backgrounds and boy the smearing was bad) and maybe size (found 32"" to be slightly big for FPS games).Other considerations:Considered many alternatives varying from 27"" 1440p to 32"" 4K monitors. Most of the 27"" 1440p monitors were limited to 144/165Hz and while it was not a deal breaker but it was inferior to 240 Hz anyways. I would have gone for 4K 144Hz monitors but then my RTX 3070 wouldn't be enough for 4K gaming. 280Hz/360Hz 1080p monitors were out of question because I don't play competitively at that level. HDR at this price range is just a marketing gimmick. You need atleast a 1000 nits panel with multiple local dimming arrays for a decent HDR experience. IMO HDR is mostly suited to OLED panels.IPS vs VA:Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 have the best VA panels in the world and are the fastest VA in the market beating even the top IPS panels. I mostly use black backgrounds and play in dark so VA were obviously a better choice with high contrast ratio and no IPS glow. The only thing that was bothering me was black smearing which luckily Samsung has done such a good job that it's on par with IPS panels. IPS do have better viewing angles but then again it wouldn't matter if it was a curved display in the first place. I don't share my screen so curved and slightly less viewing angles were ok with me.What's great:I got a decent panel with minimal backlight bleed, no dead pixels, no black smearing. Colours are far better than my previous LG monitor. Contrast and colours are great. Display is sharp and crisp and gets bright enough to use it in a well lit room. Out of the box display calibration was decent. Games look beatiful. The curve is aggressive and took me around a day to get used to and now I love it. I can keep the monitor close and focus on the center of screen (in FPS games) and still have field of vision in the corners. I use it on a DP 1.4 cable at 1440p 240Hz 10 bit (8bit+FRC).What's not so great:Size. The monitor is thick and the curve is to blame here. Make sure you have enough space on your desk. Secondly, the stand is just huge. It is very stable and offers every kind of adjustment but for a 27"" panel it is just plain huge. I use a monitor arm so that isn't an issue for me but it's something to keep in mind. Pricing is a hit or miss. Look for price cuts during sales. But comparing to other brands this is decently priced. Other brands like LG, Asus, Gigabyte has a huge difference in offshore and Indian pricing which I just consider plain cheating and greediness.Conclusion and recommendations: It's a great all rounder monitor albeit for a selected audience. It is highly recommended for someone who wants the best of both worlds (FPS+AAA gaming), prefers to use the monitor in the dark, isn't bothered by the curve, has enough space on desk or a monitor arm. Consumers who play eSports competetively should look for 1080p 280/360Hz monitors. And those who play on consoles or AAA games only should eye a 4K 144/120Hz display or OLED displays (especially for HDR). IPS panels for those who wants wider viewing angles and share screen and are not bothered by IPS glow and low contrast ratio. This is all from a gamer's perspective only as I don't use any productivity applications. Hope this helped you!"
5,"Everything i expected from this monitor, i got. I was skeptical at first since people mention flickering/stuttering issues, but my unit did not have those issues. 1440p 240hz at 10 bit color works fine with the included displayport cable since my 2070S has DP1.4 DSC support. No visible ghosting/smearing (regular or black level) and overshoot. HDR is pretty good with the max brightness of 600 nits and around 90% dcip3 and an upgrade over SDR (although not as good as my Galaxy Note 9, which is a self emissive display with 1000+ nits peak brightness and a wider color gamut).My only complaint is the VRR range of the monitor. Nvidia lists this monitor's range as 60 to 240hz, yet LFC seems to trigger as early as 90hz. If a game stays above or below 90fps, it's a non issue; but if a game moves constantly above and below 90fps, it's gonna be distracting since there's some stutter before the monitor moves in and out of LFC (This is evident for me when playing Doom eternal maxed out with rtx on). Not sure if this is from the monitor's side or nvidia's implementation of LFC on Freesync monitors."
1,Worst picture qualityPlease refrain from buying this monitor
5,I bought the 27’ monitor for my Xbox series X and it’s freaking amazing. Better performance than any other monitors that I used before for FPS shooter games . Great color and TN like low input performance. If you have the money just go for it . 100 % Future proofed.

1,"Amazon delivered the product after 6 days of ordering, the Monitor worked for few days and suddenly the display went off. Tried all the ways, but display was not working. So, i requested for replacement and the one which was received it did not even switch on, even the power light was not appearing, so returned the item completely. Beware when you purchase from amazon, there is no quality checks done. And moreover it is China made and no guarantee.I tried to register this product online in LG website, but no warranty was applied for this. It was showing Zero warranty. There is lot of complaints about this product, the softwares which comes in CD which is provided with this product not does not detect this monitor when connected to laptop, so the onscreen control functions does not work as they display in add. I googled a lot about this and found that most of them is facing this issue. Purchase from LG directly to get the warranty."
1,"Third class product, after someday display showing blank not working, BEFORE PURCHASE It was showing 3 Year warranty AFTER PURCHASE it's showing NO WARRANTY 🤒😡😡😡"
4,"*Update: Working flawless after almost two years.First of all, never buy a 25"" ultra-wide as it will be a downgrade for you from a 22"" 1920x1080 monitor because of less length (vertical). You need a very good quality GPU if you are planning to play latest titles at moderate to high setting as it is 33% more demanding than running a game in a 1920x1080 pixel display.In the box it comes with,1. Monitor2. Power Brick (similar to a average laptop)3. 1 HDMI & 1 DisplayPort Cable4. Stand & removable cable clip5. Calibration certificate and other product documentation6. A CD with type-c display driver and a software to adjust display settings on screen and a software to set/snap windows as per user defined frames (like 3 side by side windows). But you can do somewhat similar without this software with windows 10.Here is my pros and cons,Pros:1. Cheap FreeSync monitor and you can enjoy no screen tearing with a capable AMD GPU with a sync range from 40 to 75Hz. That means during movement you will not notice any screen tearing that normally occurs if monitor refresh rate not matches with GPU frame time.2. It is very big sized and you can also enjoy lot of standard movies on this display without top and bottom black bars which is normally there in any 1920x1080 i.e. 16:9 display.3. In game you can see extra space compared to 1920x1080 display. It is like using two 4:3 monitor side by side (not exactly). But it is fun when you experience it. Your field of view increases greatly. Best for video editing and multitasking. As you can open multiple windows side by side.4. VESA mount option is just fantastic for desk mount. I will post few photos of my setup. It helps to clean lot of space on the desk.6. If you have a NVIDIA card then free-sync is not officially supported. But even then you can set the refresh rate to 75Hz and enjoy extra 15 frames each second for added smoothness in games.Update: I have tested few games with nvidia GTX 1080 and free sync on @75Hz. But surprisingly free sync is working and I have not noticed and considerable screen tearing. There is a website which tests free sync vs vsync performance with the help of a moving image. When I run this test, I have found that the free sync is working with my nvidia card. Then searched you tube and found few videos where other  people also claiming that it is adding some smoothness with nvidia as well. But I want to make it very clear, this free sync might be adding some smoothness but it is not officially supported for nvidia and it is not supposed to work like a AMD card.7. It comes with factory color calibration and display is just top notch in terms of color saturation and contrast. You can not simply get a better monitor for its price in terms of default color profile preset straight out of the box.8. Decent set of speakers and Maxaudio which is simply some extra control to adjust bass, treble, stereo imaging to enhance the sound. Indeed it sounds much better than other monitor speakers. Just buy a headphone while you game. Otherwise the speakers are just decent for basic listening.Cons:The plastic feels cheap and the finishing is not smooth every edges. The construction and integrity is not robust enough. But not a big no no as it is a cheap ultrawide monitor.Verdict:If you have a decent GPU at least GTX 1060, then you can buy this. But even then you can not set setting to high in latest titles to maintain 60 fps avg. I have tested with my over-clocked Aorus GTX 1080 and even then, some of the very demanding titles, I can not set all to ultra for a smooth 60 fps (e.g. Ghost Recon Wildlands). This might be the poor optimization but this is what it is. Just to give you an idea, check your current fps in games 1920x1080 res and reduce it by 30%. This will be the rough fps you will be getting on this display as the pixel count is roughly 33% higher than 1920x1080.But if you have money then get this monitor with GTX1070 or above and you can not go back to 1920x1080 again. I also own LG 25UM65 which is 25"" even with that monitor the experience is much better than a 1920x1080 monitor for sure. If you have any other question you may comment and I shall get back to you."
4,"Please note this is not a technical spec review but more of an experience in finalising this particular monitor and the reasons behind purchasing it. I am not a gamer or nor do I work on graphics/video editing..I am just another guy who uses multiple applications at work and weekend learning on Udemy (which again requires that while you learn on one screen, the other screen can run the video lesson).When I decided to buy a monitor primarily for office work, it had to be a slightly larger screen than the ones at office (typically 21"" to 24""); simply for the reason that stacking primary screens (3-4 applications) can be done easily with more screen real estate, as compared to switching between screens all of the time.There were few other factors as well in the purchase of an ""ideal"" monitor for my work..- amount of space that could be reserved for a large monitor in addition to  Mac Book, keyboard, mouse and powerstrip with chargers at the work table- viewing distance between my seating position and the monitor- finally not spending more than 15K INR for such a monitor (if there was really a good product that costed more - I could stretch by another 20%..""max"" - no more!! I said to myself).All of the above considered, narrowed down 3 monitors between 27"" to 29"" screen size.. one was a 27"" monitor(Benq), second was 29"" monitor(Dell) and lastly this 29"" ultrawide monitor(LG).I had seen a colleague in another team use a slightly smaller but curved screen, that was nice in terms of space for windows side by side..For all practical purposes, the 29"" ultrawide reviews appealed more to me except for one fact which I had read - ultra wide screen monitors tend to lesser in height as compared to normal screens..however having seen the specs and literally read/seen multiple tech reviews, I was convinced, this was the monitor for the job.Monitor ordered; it arrived as per schedule. Opened the package, did a quick check and found all parts in place ; except that :( I couldn't help get over the feeling that someone had opened the box and had either done a check of the parts before shipping or it was opened with some other intent..well, I brushed this thought aside and did a quick check of the display by connecting it to the Mac book Pro's USB type C port using power cable of Mac book's adapter which was USB type-C as well.Sadly it didn't work; few moments of frustration..got my brother's Dell laptop which was running Windows and connected it to the display with HDMI cable..oh wow! the display came to life..quickly stacked a bunch of documents, applications side by side and extended the monitor..was happy that expectations were met..Opened a large excel sheet..I could see from Column A to Column AJ..oh joy..no more scrolling..stacked a set of 3 work related application screens side by side..tested few other combinations..monitor was awesome, text clarity was good..colors were great.Installed Onscreen app from LG website..gives you another bunch of screen stacking options.Did a bit of searching on why USB Type C cable didnt work..even though monitor supported it..found the answer on Apple's community website..the typeC USB cable needed to be gen 3.2 version and one from Belkin costs close to Rs.2500/- :( although Amazon had one option for Rs.1000/- So, bought a separate adapter [Portronics C-Konnect a 3-in-1 USB Type C Adapter ] for use with bundled HDMI cable available in the package and thats how I am using this monitor.Hope this review was useful.."
5,"I have purchased it for the development purpose, It seems suitable for long development hours with wide screen screen.The correct product info is :2560x1080 FHD+ Matt Finish DisplayIPS PanelTwo HDMI Input PortsHeadphone Jack"
5,"TL;DR:In short, the monitor is just awesome! Very good color reproduction with the factory settings out of the box. Good for gaming. Noticed no noticeable ghosting and the 75hz refresh rate is really helpful.It is a really good monitor for both gamers and designers at this price point.Long story:* Display quality - It is really good at this price point. Color reproduction is very good out of the box. I just turned down the brightness to 50%. The blacks are decent with minimum/uniform IPS glow/backlight bleed which is common to IPS monitors. I ran the EIZO monitor test and it performed pretty solid. Anti-Flickering is also very good. It can be very good for both designers and gamers at this price point.* Gaming - Very immersive and satisfied. Ran Battlefield 5, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Witcher 3, Batman Arkham Knight at 2560x1080 at 75hz and it feels really good with the ultrawide experience. Did not try 1ms MBR or the Black Stabilizer, as there was no noticeable ghosting.* Graphic Designing - Decent monitor for graphic designing at this price point. ~99%sRGB palette reproduces colors very good. Although it is a 6bit+FRC monitor (and not a true 8bit panel), there is no issue with differentiating the colors with minor variation. Gradients are also very nice and colors feel natural as my earlier Dell monitor.* Build quality - Decent. Though some users may report its wobbly, it's not much of a deal breaker. The plastic on the LCD panel is seamlessly well fitted without any loose ends.* Speakers - Decent. But you would definitely want to pair it with an external sound system.* Accessories - 1 display port and 1 HDMI cable are really good to have.As a conclusion, if someone wants to enjoy an ultrawide experience without spending a lot, then this is definitely the monitor to go for. You just need to have a decent GPU GTX 1060/RX 460 to fully get this monitor going. Graphic designers and gamers both can undoubtedly opt for this monitor."
5,"I'd held off from buying a monitor as most manufacturers in India play their customers for fools- 768p (HD) monitors of 19+"" sizes at the same prices where international customers get FHD, and FHD at those prices where international customers get QHD and above.I had done some high school maths on monitor dimensions and deduced that the best balance between monitor size and text sharpness was when I have 1080p at the height of a 16:9l 17"" monitor.I tried out a couple of Zebronics monitors before this. They were very light and I was very impressed with their after-sale service. But the viewing angles were horrible.Eye strain during the lock-down forced me to consider this one.My main considerations were:1- Brand: yet to own an LG product which I was not happy with (mobiles excluded)2- Size: Because of the 21:9 aspect ratio, this 25"" monitor is only as high as a 17"" monitor of the normal 16:9 ratio.3- Pixel pitch: 1080p in the height of a normal 17"" monitor should give text that is acceptably sharp. I read newspapers and magazines online; and work on large documents and spreadsheets- so text clarity was a big thing for me.4- Price: this one is the cheapest you can get for this quality of display (~17"" FHD at ₹ 12,000)My experience:1- Price: 3 STAR. The LG site price is ₹ 12,100, and I got this for around 2k higher. Maybe it was because of the cost of shipping, or extra demand after lockdown. Cost was high, but I guess that is acceptable now because of he risks of local shopping.2- product Quality: 4 STAR. A big difference compared to Zebronics, but still not quite what LG used to give. The sides of the panels are delicate and the monitor needs to be held in a certain way to avoid accidental damage. This is mentioned in the small manual. Do read it carefully.3- Connectivity: 5 STAR: 2 HDMI, 1 Headphone and 1 Power (single brick 3 Pin, like an Asus Laptop Charger)4- Image Quality: Good brightness and contrast. Colour hue is not bluish like most laptops. It is slightly brown and fairly easy on the eye. Screen is matte so no reflections. No bright indicators in the front.5- Text Quality: 4 STAR: Text is sharp as can be for this pixel pitch. Much better than FHD monitors, but not as good as Acer FHD laptop screens. Text rendition is a mix of the display quality and the adjustments in Windows ClearType and Display Gamma. Even after extensive adjustment, it is okay. But lacks the contrast needed for hours of comfortable viewing. Hue is very good.6- Display Aspect: 5 STAR: The 21:9 aspect is a revelation. The 1080p, small size (17"" type height) and extra width mean that you can easily view 2 windows at side by side.7- Mounting: 5 STAR: I mounted it on an existing AmazonBasics Monitor Mount. Mounts and balances like a charm. Just at eye level.VERDICT: Priced higher than MRP, but is the best you can get (and use) at this price. Buy it without thinking, you will not regret it.Those who are in the productive field (office use, number crunching, multi-tasking) will find it a boon."
5,"I wanted a professional monitor for programming. Read a lot about benefits of ultra wide monitor but also was sceptical about it especially whether it skew the text because of pixels. But then its really clear. Note that I tried a 32inch TV (not full hd) and was really very afraid if the monitor would turn out like that.  But am really impressed with the clarify and options to adjust the screen for work. Cannot ask more.Also Was not sure whether to buy the 27th inch regular monitor or but a 29inch ultra wide. But note that ultra wide 29inch is not just 2 inches bigger than than 27inch. It is very wide screen and at the same time till within the reach of the eye. The wide screen gives a really awesome experience if you ask me. I can easily work with 6 way split and still text is crystal clear. This monitor really worth every penny.  I use it as desktop for my lenovo t480 laptop, no need for extended, because i dont think i need the laptops screen space after this much real estate.If given a chance I would buy the same monitor again and never buy a regular monitor ever. Its a dream for programmers and especially the lg software you can download online for the On Screen Manager. Really worth buy for someone looking for working purpose. Note that it is a gaming monitor as well which is really an extra and I do not use it for gaming. So this review is just about the professional monitor usage. Really no brainer to buy this great piece from LG and LG is really good when it comes to customer experience especially in cities. Once again thanks LG for this genuinely useful product. Also saw a few movies and since its 21:9 format which is what netflix movies (not tv series) play and is the format used in movie theatres, its really good for this monitor costs. For me these are just extras. main purpose for me is work. I think I have shared enough information and hope it helps."
5,Good product . Value for money .perfect for  Audio video editing & graphic works and photoshop etc.
5,"I got this product for about 16k (17k-10%HDFC discount) on Amazon sale.° Will definitely boost your productivity as it being an ultrawide has a lot of screen space.  I can now review/write/code as i am watching a video about a topic (photo attached)° On VS code you can easily view the variable explorer and jupyter notebook on the right along with the main code on the left without any issue (photo attached).°Gaming experience is also really great here. The monitor being 75hz and supports Freesync. This for those players who play a lot of multiplayer fps(non professionals as no 144hz) and single player story games. I play csgo occasionally and it supports 2560x1080 resolution. The resolution gives you a better fov(field of vision) but make sure your graphics card can support the resolution the monitor offers (If not you can lower the game resolution and play on stretched mode that's ok too).° But for gaming i have to say playing story mode games give you just another experience that in my opinion just can't be had in a regular monitor. (Screenshot of Myrdalssandur Island).° The speakers are also not bad actually. They are definitely loud they are on the back so that could be a minor issue but yeah it's fine.° Watching YouTube will give you black bars as most of the videos are not in the monitors resolution. However, again the screen is so big it doesn't even matter. (Screenshot attached).I would say if you are looking to buy a professional / casual gaming monitor go for these ultrawide monitors. You may not see a reason to buy it initially like i did but you will see how it improves your experience overall."
5,"As a new stock trader, I wanted to get the best setup that my little profits could buy. After a lot of research and reviews I settled on 2 ultrawide monitors rather than multiple smaller monitors.The LG 34 inch ultrawide provided the most bang for the buck and I am not disappointed with the purchase. The setup and installation was effortless. Over the past 6 months, both the monitors have performed perfectly - connected to a Macbook Pro. The average day starts around 9AM (Indian markets open) and goes on till 1:30AM at night (US market close)They perform like a workhorse with no complains.I also have Windows 10 (bootcamp) on my macbook. I am not sure whether its the Macbook hardware or windows drivers, but the highest resolution is not available when I am logged on to windows. Tried all driver downloads from LG and Microsoft. On the Macintosh, it works like magic.Overall a great product at a very reasonable price."
5,"I was lucky enough to receive a working unit, and this monitor is gorgeous. For those of you who are unable to figure what 29"" on a UW monitor means, This monitor would be a 23"" monitor if it was a regular 16:9 screen. I bought this monitor to hook it up to my laptop, and it has been a purchase worth the money.For those worried about color gamut, I used an app called 'DisplayHDR Test' from the Microsoft Store, it works on the software side of things and it reported a 99.9% sRGB, 87.1% Adobe RGB, 83.6% DCI-P3 coverage.The Screen:The panel is nice and bright, FreeSync by default is disabled and Windows sets the refresh rate to 59Hz, so once that was sorted, everything was good to go. I sit around 45-60 cm away from the monitor, so I do see slight pixelation (It is a 95.8 DPI panel). Backlight bleed isn't too bad. I personally don't notice it until it is dark in the room and screen goes black. I'd say it's a solid A- when it comes to bleed.PS: the monitor recommended 60Hz rather than 75Hz, and FreeSync is kind of wonky. My best guess is this is due to HDMI. I will try to connect via DisplayPort and update my review.The Speakers:I expected the speakers to be useless, but these are pretty decent speakers. I use it to listen to music.UPDATE: few weeks later, I now prefer the speakers on the monitor to my older speaker setup. These are very usable speakers. The speakers have no bass at all, but I wasn't expecting that in the first place. The clarity on the speaker is really good.Extras:The OSD is controlled by a very neat little Joystick that is below the monitor in the center. It is good design in the sense that it doesn't need more buttons, just one joystick."
5,"29 inches are just perfect. Everything is in front of you, you don't have to keep moving your head. And, color reproduction is great. My only gripe is that I can't use 75hz refresh rate. Maybe something wrong with my system. But, this thing is great. Movies and games are just too much fun. In built speakers are good too if you don't have anything. But, i hardly use them."
5,One awesome monitor for my programming and gaming needs.Budget monitor for 22kIt won't look Big in the pic but boy you sit 1 feet away from the monitor you need to move your head left to right.Awesome colour. Gaming yet to try.
5,Being a video editor this monitor do serve the purpose.First of all I was confused to buy a regular 16:9 ratio 27inch monitor or an ultrawide.I own a 21 inch monitor and a side by side photo with ultrawide is available.This one is 29 inch model. Also available in 34inch and 25 inch variant. The reason I haven't gone with 34 is lack of vesa mount option as I want my monitor on arm. Currently its not but it would be. And many says 25 inch would be too small.1. This monitor is colour calibrated but I haven't found written in description. But it is cause there is certificate inside box which proves that.Colour calibration is important for video editor in colour grading.You would be amazed how great the picture look due color in person.2. Most people says and ultrawide helps in video editing. Which I truly agree. I have photos of using davinci resolve timeline both in ultrawide and normal 21 inch monitor.3. I  do have tested out few games. The black stabilizer is amazing when game is quite dark. With black stabilizer you can see everything.4. My graphic card is 750ti OC for who are concerned if you need really high end graphics card.5. The screen is matte finish and not glossy. And since my 21 inch monitor is glossy finish I haven't really need how much great a matte finish monitor is. You can work with your window open without any problem.6. I recommend few software and setting to make the full use of this monitor.a) use displayfusion software. There is photo of taskbar with multiple icon. Which is great for arranging windows.  Really great if you use 2 or more monitor setup.b) use utrawideo chrome extension. It helps to remove black side bars. And make overall look more immersive. There's again pictures of it. It may not suitable for all types of videos.c) use crop on vlc player. Again for immersive look.7. Does this monitor help in general productivity? Yes it does. Opening two Windows side by side is much better then and a normal 16:9 monitor.8. Who should buy this monitor? If you are a video editor or graphic design really great monitor. And since it have low response rate in black stabilizer really great for gaming. If you are planning to use a single monitor buy a ultrawide. If you are a laptop user and want external display this is great.
3,"First time i received wrong product with open package. The monitor inside was different. Not sure whether problem was from seller end or in transit. I had to wait for another week for replacement. Replacement had proper packing.I have tested HDMI and DP port and it works fine. However, Type C does not work, not even with apple macbook air. If you want to buy this for type c like me, this is not for you."
3,"Display is amazing but the build quality is pathetic. Had to return twice, both the times top panel of diplay was popping out. LG seriously need to work on their quality control.As usual Amazon return and refund process was flawless. Got the refund within 2 weeks. Despite loving the display I need to search for other brands now."
5,"One of the primary reasons I got this monitor apart from its ultrawide nature was the presence of a USB C port. I had a few doubts beforehand including whether this would work with the M1 Macbook. I am delighted to say that it works provided you have the right cable. I am using a USB 3.1 gen 2 cable and it works like a charm. Another doubt I had was if the monitor would be able to charge the Macbook. When I connected for the first time, the charging symbol came up but I noticed that the laptop was discharging slowly. I realized that this monitor wasn't capable of supplying enough wattage to charge the Mac. Having said that, if you close the MacBook's lid and just use this monitor, it is capable of charging it without any issues.The picture quality is awesome and the monitor I got has no screen bleed except for a very tiny area on the top right-hand corner. Couldn't ask for more at this budget"
4,"I bought an LG Ultrawide 29 inch monitor during this Dasara sale. The price was 17K INR. I bought this monitor mainly for office work since I've to find more workspace for multiple applications run side by side. Few points I would like to share.Windows 10 OS:I've connected DP cable to LG 29"" ultra-wide monitor. Downloaded Onscreen application from the LG support page. The experience is good. Work fine. Also, the inbuilt speakers do a great job. No problem.Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS:I've another laptop, runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I did extend the display via HDMI cable. I don't see an Onscreen driver available for Ubuntu, so there is no split-screen stuff to do. However, HDMI does a great job with extended display and audio output too. That's also fine and satisfying.MacBook Air 2019:I gave a USB C (since USB C input was provided) connection from my MacBook Air device to the LG 29"" ultrawide monitor. Unfortunately, MacBook Air did not recognize the monitor. After Googling, I understood this monitor resolution does not fit with MacBook. This made me unsatisfied as it did not work as I expected.However, I gave another try connecting MacBook Air using a display converter. USB C to HDMI converter and HDMI to LG Monitor. This worked fine. LG should've mentioned this in the description.Anyway, its been two weeks since I unpacked this device. So far it is doing good. I hope it works fine without any problem.Coming to delivery packaging, I received a direct LG box being shipped to my address. I was wondering, why Amazon did not take extra care to give additional cardboard package for safety concerns.  What if the LG box gets damaged due to any jolt during logistic shipment. Although my shipment showed few scratches, fortunately, the monitor inside wasn't damaged."
5,"75hz. It shows very good colors.Excellent for watching movies.Inbuilt speakers not good, may gets the job done.Best for multitasking but little problem because it is a flat display, if you sit closer to display you feel corners are very far.Near means below one nd half feet.No other issues.Daily it wakes with me - sleeps with me.At least 18hours a day- screen ON time."
5,"It's amazing monitor in short.I was waiting for a deal and finally, I got this one for 14400 in the sale.I am using this monitor with ""MacBook pro 13"" mid 2012"" and unfortunately, my pc is not supporting the full resolution required for this monitor. if you look into the 2nd picture, You can see the black space on left and right. However, this is not a problem with the monitor. I tried connecting other pc and it just worked fine.+1 for the inbuilt speakers which are far better than my pc speakers.+1 for the cables provided in the box - HDMI, Display Port.Inputs: HDMI, Display Port, Type COutputs: AuxI used a VESA Mount to hold this guy in place which allows rotating the screen.Link to vesa mount: https://www.amazon.in/FLEXIMOUNTS-Monitor-Screen-Height-adjustable/dp/B075RZ44VL/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=vesa+mount&qid=1571111566&smid=A3DNRLV37D436R&sr=8-10"
5,"It's great for coders and designers. The fonts appearance is very clear. Those who do jobs from their PC like designing, coding or any other job that requires PC, then this monitor is for them. I can watch videos online and do coding at the same time. It is as if you have two different monitors in a single monitor.I am happy with this product because it got my job done.Thanks :)"
5,"Great monitor for the price. I use it only for photo and video editing. Not so much for gaming.The speakers are nothing great, at least to my standards. They are loud enough, however, since they are firing downwards, there is no clarity. However, with tuning the max audio settings, you can get a pretty decent output.Apart from this its a treat to watch movies on this.. you get a really immersive experience. And the multi window setup is like having 2 laptops at the same time.I recommend it."
5,"I purchased two of these ultrawide monitors from AMAZON at great price of 18000 x 2 = 36000If you see the pic I have vesa mounted them , and they are absolutely georgious. overall I have tried multiple games still not seeing any real issue. both of them are connected to my NVIDIA gtx 1080 one through dvi and the other through display port. still now have not faced any issue only time will tell .... what happens."
5,29 inch was good enough for 3 split windows. cheap option @17300. I used Mini DP to DP wire to connect my surface pro 4.  netflix quality was good from 2 feet distance and trading graphs readable and straight lines are sharp. no syrain to hrs as ai sit on an average 3 to 5 hrs daily. good buy
5,"Its good,  especially watching movies and all games can be played in full screen if you are not able to then download '' Flawless wide-screen'' and select your game...."
5,"I am an IT professional and this Monitor just straight up works !Box comes with all the right cords and power cables required, except Thunderbolt cable, as Thunderbolt connectivity for Monitors is not as mainstream as HDMI or Display Port.  29"" Monitor supports 2560x1080 pixels, and give you a wide and immersive view (21:9 Aspect Ratio).The Monitor has online software available that helps you split the viewing screen into different sections as required, and gives a lot of parallel productivity. For Multitasking, the amount of space available is just better !And 75 Hz Refresh rate is not at all bad. If you have the current next gen consoles like XBox Series X or PS5, they will support this monitor, but the only bottleneck will be the Monitor, as these consoles push 100+ FPS, and the monitor will only support 75 Hz refresh rate. AMD Freesync is also available, an added advantage. If you are using Xbox Series S Console, this may be just the perfect match for this Monitor. But if you are using last gen consoles like Xbox One or PS4, they only support 16:9 aspect ratio which can cause some black bars in either sides. But it can be bypassed at the expense of Clarity by using Ultra Wide configuration in the monitor. The use of Ultra wide image option on 16:9 Aspect ratio can cause Pixel tearing in viewing at 21:9 Aspect ratio resulting in reduced clarity and a bit wide graphics.Overall, current AAA title games support Ultrawide, and this can be the sweet spot for work as well as gaming !"
4,"The monitor provides excellent picture quality with great colors and brightness. I run mine at about 65% brightness as any thing beyond that is too bright for my eyes. Response time is good, no apparent ghosting. The control joystick is intuitive and the onscreen controls are a big help. There are a few cons however with this model1. Bezels are too big at about 1/3rd of an inch2. No height adjustmentIn general, the Ultra wide format is also slightly problematic for general use. Browsing on fullscreen is a strain, so you should stick to a normal window size. YouTube videos will not fill the screen and have black bars at the side. Some games can't handle ultra wide, so they will also have black bars or just cover the normal aspect ratio.But for productivity, the facility to run side by side windows when writing code, music/video editing or game design is a big plus.I would recommend 29in minimum for decent verical height and at 19k, it's hard to beat. 32in if it becomes priced comparative to this one vs the ridiculous 72k price tag right now."
5,Best monitor in this price rangeGood for video editing and watching movies.This is actually very small. Dont go by 25 inch number
5,"Thanks AmazonI got this product early😘I'm using this monitor mainly for FL studioAnd making contents ..It has variety of picture modes like Reader,Photo,gaming and many moreThe monitor looks so glossy..You may think this monitor is a bezzeless display but actual when you turn on this you can see the bezzelsAnd the monitor is not that bigFor a price of 11k It's definitely worth buying 😘👍"
5,"I have been using this monitor for the last 2 months and initially I was little skeptical about ordering this monitor after going through all the negative reviews, where someone have doubt about the quality of the product and defective piece got delivered.But, now I can say that this is the right monitor for all types of works as per my opinion. I have been mostly using this monitor for doing software development work from home and it has increased my productivity quite a lot. I am not using the Onscreen control software which comes along with this monitor for dividing the screens, but I am using Powertoys, which provide some shortcuts keys to organize the windows and it is quite good."
1,"does the monitor have in built speaker?  there are so many posts in the internet about no sound,  can you help?Called LG, they say there is no speaker on the monitor, there is no clarity in the product details for this.  I see so many people like me got confused and spent hours to fix like me.I very upset Amazon refuses to take the product back and provide a different model replacement (though I am going to pay the differential).  Why I am being force to take a product which is of no use to me,  very poor service from Amazon.  I called customer service, been in call with them for sometime, no luck yet."
4,"I would have given this monitor 3 stars, but because of the utility it serves and the colour reproduction perhaps, I am giving it one more star.I had to replace the monitor because the first one had pixel defects - like a bunch of pixels were dimmer than surrounding pixels and it looked like a dead pixel - like a pin head dark spot - once you know it exists you cannot un-notice it. I mean in 2019, no one should have to deal with pixel defects. I paid for 2560x1080 perfect pixels, not (2560x1080 minus one). If you get pixel defects like dead pixels get it replaced immediately because LG will not honour warranty simply for one or two dead pixels - may be you will need 5 dead pixels to get it replaced through manufacturer. In this regard, at least Amazon allows one replacement and then a refund. Computer shops in India will simply wash their hands off and say they sold you a ""factory sealed"" piece and leave you to deal with the manufacturer.I would have expected a bit more sturdy build quality. Let's see - although it comes with a 3 year warranty. The replacement thankfully (till now) does not have pixel defects, but has some backlight bleed, but this is within acceptable limits - and considering backlight bleed is usually an issue in IPS panels, its not noticeable generally.For the price I got it in The Great Indian Festival Sale that concluded recently, its just about okay. I mainly bought it for coding purpose - for side by side diffs. Also you can watch 21:9 videos in 2K resolution (1440p). Check youtube."
4,I was looking for a mid range budgeted ultrawide monitor for my video editing and this product is at its best. It gives 75Hz refresh rate as mentioned and not suitable for gamers. Colors are accurate and good for video and photo editing. Very good for color grading as well.The over all build quality is average but best at its price range. If you are looking for a good built quality then you can go for some higher end model.  LG software gives you the screen sharing options where you can use multiple programs in one screen equally distributed.Its a good purchase as a budgeted monitor dont expect any thing high .4 Star for the product at its price range.
4,"Using since 10-15 days now.Bought for home office and was very keen on split screen feature. I had no gaming intentions.Works fine, sleak design, good picture quality and wide enough for splitting the screen.Can get a good view of outlook on one side and visual studio/excel on the other.I did try playing NFS and it worked fine too without any lags. Didn't try very high end combat games though.All in all, if you are looking for home office then it's a good value for money at 25k. Go for it."
4,"They should have added 2 HDMIs and a height adjustable stand. Nothing so great, but serves the purpose. Size and screen ratio are very appropriate for those who want to see multiple things all at once on the screen. Price is a bit pumped up now probably because of high demand. Hoping it will get back to the old one so that I can buy one more."
2,"The M5 32"" (₹ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(₹ 37000).The only two differences being -1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.  However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ₹ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.-------Detailed Review :What's in the box? 🎁1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)2. Power Adapter3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteriesWhat's not? 🚫USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".What's great? 😻1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.But make no mistake, the monitor doesn’t support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would’ve summed up a quality entertainment.What's Meh? 😼1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you’ve a strong Wifi, you can’t leverage the Tv features much.5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that’s understandable.  However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."
5,"Once i decided to buy 32"" 4K monitor for my programming related work with the requirement of USB-C and USB hub, Almost all everywhere suggesting to go for IPS panel as the text will be blurry in VA panels and also it has very poor viewing angles.  As i said, my main use will be coding in visual studio in windows machine(XPS13) and almost 10 hour average will looking at VS IDE :D.  So text should be super crisp and sharp, but most of the online reviews says VA is bad for text due to blurriness. On top of that, earlier batch of M7 had lots of negative reviews like very dark/dim display, USB-C not detecting signals, 4K only with 30Hz instead of 60Hz. So after lots of confusion, almost decided to buy LG32UN880 on sale day which had price of 60K and this also has IPS panel, so no worry of blurry text.  Remember only LG32UN880 had satisfied all my requirement of USB-C with PD and USB hub for keyboard/mouse , apart from samsung M7.  All other monitors are touching above 80K with  these features.When i almost about to buy LG32UN880, the price increased to 72K, so little disappointed and decided not to go ahead with 4K monitors for now, since my original budget was 35K(at max 50K).  But somewhat that big monitor upgrade itch has not stopped :(, so thought better to try M7 which was available for 32K with card discount.  Went ahead with the order after lots and lots of confusion.After i setup the monitor(initially i did not had USB-C cable, neither monitor came with one as well) with HDMI, i was blown away with the text quality.  it was very sharp and crisp, no blurriness at all.  And no issue with the viewing angle as i will be anyway sitting in front of the monitor.  There was no quality difference with my existing IPS full hd monitor at all.  Luckily i was saved with amazon last moment price increase on that LG monitor, otherwise i should have spent 60K for LG32UN880.  What a last minute save :D, now its almost 50% cheaper for this M7 monitor.  Additonally with extra 2 years(total 5 years) warranty as a festival offer for M7.Two minor cons, 1. as everyone mentioned, it comes 16A big plug, but i had old printer 5A cable, so it was not an issue for me.  2. HDMI gives out only 30 frames for 4K, so dragging windows wont look nice and no USB-C cable as well in our region(very bad of Samsung on this, because for US, they provide this cable).Got this USB-C cable for Rs.1249. (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07Y7GVGBF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and now all working great with perfect single cable solution.  4K@60Hz and PD charging the laptop with above single cable from monitor works perfectly fine.  Tested with M1 mac as well, its very good.Lots of people complained about very dim/poor brightness display, but personally for my work, i had to set 30 for brightness as default 50 is too bright for my liking.PS: Usually i dont write amazon product review, unless its bad :D.  But the reason for writing this review is, when i was researching on M7, none of the reviews(mostly sponsored) all over internet and user reviews from bestbuy, amazon.com...) was talking about text related quality, everyone just talks about this smart features like netflix...  No one, literally no one shared their experience on coding/text related display feedback.  And if u go to monitors sub-reddit and everyone there will scare you about samsung(personally had very poor experience with samsung frame TV purchase and had to struggle lot to return, then got LG C9).I just hope this review helps someone who have requirement like me and confused with which monitor to choose.  This M7 at ~32K is best one currently with USB-C, PD, USB hub feature and bonus smart features(which i wont be using at), also 5 years warranty.  For similar budget around 30K, benq ew3270 VA panel will not have any of these features."
5,"Pros:Display of SamsungTV with app, happy with tizen as it supports all streaming appsSamsung Dex: with supporting phone can use all appsFree keyboard and mice2 Hdmi ports, see to switch between laptop and desktopCons:Audio is okay for casual use...use external speakers or soundboard"
3,"I am writing this review after 15 days of using the M5 27inch smart monitor: It is a decent monitor for programming activity but not for gamers or graphics designees.  but the price is a bit high comparing the feature it offers. I would expect a more refreshing rate and low response time within the price range. It would be great to have more resolution than 1920X1080 with a monitor of 27inch but I am ok with the resolution. Don't go for this monitor just by looking into the fancy things it offers like OTT apps specifically. There are a lot better options available in the market within the price range(23899.00/- INR).  The few good things are build quality, the look is really premium, connectivity options are relatively better (more connectivity options mostly connecting mobile devices), the inbuilt speakers produce good quality sound, you can really take advantage of the monitor size as you can work with multiple windows side by side which is obvious with any 27inch monitor, the Installation is really easy."
1,"I have owned multiple monitors for a long period of time, this is the only monitor that stopped working even before it's been a month of delivery.I generally prefer BenQ, just for the smart features, I went for this. I literally waited for months, for it to come back on sale and I literally disappointed with the reliability of the monitor.Will update about the after-sales service asap"
5,"After a ton of research finally got Samsung M5 27 inch. It is well balanced for a WFH situation and also acts as an standalone TV (which is a very useful and must be feature missing in almost all monitors in market). Apps load fast and UI is fluid. It has in built bluetooth, wifi, remote sharing , AirPlay and tons of smart features. It comes with a remote as well.Only con I would say would be a bit washed out feeling of very small font texts (if you sit very close and notice hard ), be aware it's 27inch so can't complain much.For average(or any) user it's a must buy monitor considering the price and features offered. Hard core gamers can go for much refresh rate monitor and can ignore this, also Samsung never mentioned this as gaming one.From my impression it's A clear go ahead.."
4,"Simply put, this is the swiss army knife of monitors. It has wireless connectivity features such as Wireless display (Windows), Airplay 2 (Apple devices) and Screen mirroring (Android devices), all of these through Wifi. Wireless devices like TWS earphones can be connected using Bluetooth 4.2. Wired connectivity options include USB Type C (display + 65W charging capability!), HDMI and USB Type A ports for devices like mouse, keyboard etc. All of these works fine.During leisure time it can double as a Smart TV with WiFi. Perfect for work from home setups!Cons:- VA Panel is not great, IPS would have been better.- Large 16A plug, so adaptor will be required if the socket is smaller.- Annoying Samsung TV Plus app which plays by default in the home, but this can be disabled."
5,"VA panel > good chance of winning in panel lottery. 1080p is not sufficient for 27"" monitor/text work. Good colors as compared to budget TN panel monitors. Nice speakers, they do get loud but still feel inadequate for movies dialogues at times. No 3.5mm aux/headphone jack so you have to connect to external speakers using Bluetooth. Very good connectivity options, do check them before buying. Don't plan for charging mobile on its USB connection. Remote is unique in shape. Samsung is adding channels on its Smart TV plus. hope they keep adding more. Couldn't use HDR yet, not sure if internal apps support/drive it in HDR mode."
1,"Received a damaged monitor and Amazon is unable to help in returning. As soon as we turned on, the welcome screen looks like this.The seller is a big fraud."
3,"Very good smart TV with future ready features. Not a monitor at all, the basic features of monitor are missing. Samsung tried it's best to create a hybrid version and it's not enough. 32"" monitor should have screen split and screen resolution adjustments. Appreciate the PC on screen option which will allow users to access personal cloud accounts with click of a button. The OS isn't great and fast enough, Samsung please push updates to optimize and improve performance. Overall its a one in kind smart TV with future ready options. Not a monitor at all."
4,"Pros:1) Excellent remote&stand quality2) HDR10 support, my usb-c to usb-c thunderbold cable did not support HDR, so changed the cable to usb-c-hdmi cable.3) Audio&Video quality exceeded my expectation.Cons:1) Finding driver for windows is cumbersome, downloading ""SxxAM70xN"" and installing does the job with some perils.- It gets extracted in ""Documents"" directory with non-english window.- Driver is not digitally signed2) Comes with 16A plug so you need convertor plug or a 6A C13 connector cable."
2,"As a smart display i can give 5 stars but as monitor it is useless one. Too much of delay in mouse movement. When i scroll to third page in my lap, aftr 3sec only the display moves to third page that much it is delayed"
5,"It is a big screen, even 27 inch it is big, I use it for office work and 2 documents can be opened side by side. Enjoy netflix in the evenings... sound from the monitor is also clear and loud... will need to increase volume to enjoy better... it is expensive by the benefits are also more... just one thing I got a 15 amp plug with the unit, and had to get an extension box for the same as my wall 15amp is far from where I want to place this..."
1,A big factor of the cost is because the monitor can support wireless display from Windows & Mac laptops however that connectivity is so slow that you will be forced to switch to wired.Other smart features like Apps from Tizen & 4K display function as expected
1,Defective TV...unexpected lines in monitor observed on powerup within minutes of monitor delivery. Amazon customer care informed but they have been troubling for pickup and initiating refund since last 4 days.
5,Awesome product!! Great picture quality and all apps work brilliantly. Remote is small and compact and requires 2 double a batteries provided with the monitor itself. I have been using this for 1 and a half months and am not noticing any defects so far. Overall great product and good worth for money.
1,Smart tv picture quality is not sharp. Doesn't let you install any other browser. Samsung internet browser browsing experience is very bad. Very slow page or inages rendering. I'm using 200Mbps internet.Sound quality is good.Settings doesn't allow picture settings to be changed while on smart tv mode.I would not recommend buying this monitor.Better get a normal monitor and top up with single chip pc Android or windows baser for better usage.Even Amazon prime stick gives better smart tv and browsing experience.
5,I have been using this for about 10days now and I have really liked the monitor. It has ton of features.The best part is the charging 65w port which allows you to reduce the clutter on the desk.Airplay is awesome no lag in video and in audio at all on airplay. Some amazing work done by Samsung here.Thank you Amazon for the quickest delivery of this amazing product.
5,"Worth every penny u spend on this monitor, run it as a monitor / tv / watch prime / Netflix, connect your pc remotely, access office 365 instantly and work, connect to your cloud server with out laptop or pc… it’s future proof, go for it.This 43 inch M7 comes with a normal 2 pin plug (not 16 amp, so many comments earlier  mentioned it comes with 16amp)USB-C cable not included"
4,The main advantage is that the monitor comes with a remote it is same as the Samsung smart  TV remote. With the remote you can seamlessly switch between TV and Monitor mode. The monitor have 2 HDMI ports and one is with ARC. But i have experiencing an issue that except YouTube none of the smart TV apps support ARC sound output. Amazon prime or any other app sound output only will come through the Bluetooth.  I have connected a sound bar using HDMI ARC but only in YouTube will get the sound.
5,"It’s an amazing combination of monitor cum TV !!Keep in mind that your primary purpose should be monitor n not a TV for this product!!! However as TV also it’s perfect except it’s size, as 32” is getting considered as smaller for TV nowadays.But would like to highlight that as TV too, it’s picture n sound quality are absolutely fine n one can enjoy watching it.  As my primary purpose is monitor n I m having another large TV screen, this is acceptable as secondary TV to me.As a monitor it’s resolution is superb n suitable for working for whole day without any eye strain!!Connectivity through HDMI or through USB C is also seamless n working without trouble. Can be mounted on wall too with VESA 100x100 n hence having flexibility to keep as per your convenience."
5,"Have received this awesome 43 inch 4k Smart monitor today and have tested it out with a fire stick connected, tested it with my Samsung smartphone and also tested it with my lenovo d330 ideapad connected wirelessly. Awesome pictures quality and sound. I would like to inform all prospective buyers that the 43 inch monitor definitely comes with a 2 pin NORMAL PLUG and not with a 16 amp. BIG PLUG as mentioned by other reviews about the 32 and 27 inches M7 monitor. Maybe the 32 and 27 inch m7 monitor come with the big plug and is true because I've seen a YouTube video confirming the same and also several reviews about the big PLUG. But be rest assured that the 43 inch M7 model monitor comes with the normal 2 pin plug as used in all homes in india.Shall further give more details in upcoming reviews after doing more testing. It is a smart TV too with Tizen os with limited apps as far as our type of requirements in india as compared to Android and Apple."
4,"Nothing is perfect and so does this samsung monitor. I wish samsung included a webcam, mic & USB4 support to this monitor. Otherwise it’s a good TV, good monitor and a PC like product. With so many free desktop as a service options becoming easily available these days, especially after windows 365 release, this monitor will be a smart pick..good job samsung 👍"
5,"I wasn't expecting anything spectacular as Dell or LG from this monitor. As, also it was a VA Panel. As my expectations were low, the product felt as a value for money pick for me. I was only looking for a 32 inch 4k monitor for programming. So the TV part is a added bonus for me, which proved to be fun, as i can move away from my work and watch tv from Bed. Also , the 16 amps plug wasnt a problem for me, as i used the power cable from my old monitor instantly on this one. I am not sure, where that will cause damage in long run.Coming to programming ona 4k monitor, the max resolution is not good for me ,as the fonts are very small ,eventhough you get a lot of real estate. I use 3k resolution for programming. May be for video editing, the 4k resolution is good. If you are so much into details and is intending to use for graphics editing, i wont suggest this monitor. I frankly noticed anything bad about it. But This is no where near the professional monitors from Dell or even LG. I have a 21 inch Dell monitor , which i bought 9 years back. Man, those colors are perfect, than even my macbook pro. So, this is a good buy, if you expectations are low."
2,"Lap to monitor via Wireless connectivity has laggggDisplay is is too harsh….was expecting screen like monitors…but this is same like TV and very difficult for eyes even at the very low brightness.2. No option to install chrome and provided search engine is very slow.3. Glair is too much on eyes, which is causing eye burning.Will not recommend for monitor…for daily use."
4,"Except for the height adjustment (manufacturer does not provide), this is one hell of a product. Work on it like it was your computer, attach a laptop and work while relieving your eyes of strain (thanks to adaptive brightness) or chill out using your smart TV. It is a definite win-win.Samsung- with height adjustment, you'd have topped the board."
1,"From the very first setup the monitor tried to turn on, but only a hazy light appeared which is visible in the dark (only later did i find that this was a common problem with Samsung M7’s). Never got to the first home screen. Disappointed, but still waiting for the replacement. Hope the next one doesn’t disappoint like this item."
1,"Broken product sent, Dealer dosent seem to authentic, both the usb ports not working"
3,"this product does not detect usb camera...cannot launch Google meet or any other app and cannot do any video conferencing...this product  always has to be connected to laptop...  This a very newly launched product even the Samsung technicians are aware what needs to be done...this product is definitely cannot be called as all in one monitor plus tv...many functionalities are not supported as only the Samsung operating system is installed, no windows or Google operating system can be installed..and the functions that supported are of no use at all....I could have bought a ordinary monitor for rs 5k or 6k with hdmi cable and get it connected to my laptop instead paying 24k and follow the same process...I bought this product to attend online classes which I am not able to do...this is product is more of a tv and very less of a monitor"
5,"I was looking for a replacement for my 29"" LED TV. I had a cabinet width restriction and could not opt for a 32"" screen size and I found this 27"" screen SMART MONITOR. The features sounded good and supplier feedback said this monitor does support Set Top Box with HDMI connections. Sounded like magic, correct screen size that i am looking for, Can run Cabel TV and is a smart monitor in terms of most common OTT platforms. Took a chance and orderd and subsequently recvd the MONITOR.After running and installing and USING the same, it turned out to be a PERFECT machine for my utility with no deficiencies. For my use it all PROS and NO CONS. The Set Top box TV channels run perfect, all most popular OTTS like PRIME + NETFLIX + SONYLIV + ZEE5 + VOOT + HOTSTAR + JIO CINEMA....all work perfectly well."
1,I thought of using it as my main monitor. But the response is very very slow compared to my current monitor. Also it hangs my laptop most of the time. The power adapter is also not suitable for my work place due to its 16Amps socket. I would never recommend it for a monitor. The smart tv part of it is still better and satisfactory.
5,Excellent resolution
5,"Good quality visuals, a convenient size for office work"
1,This has to be the worst monitor I have ever seen. Blank white screen was looking like a light gray in color.Resolution is also poor.
5,Nice product value for money 💰
3,Not a good quality product. Within a month there is a complaint in display.

3,It is not ips and not led it is tn and lcd monitor
5,Clarity is good and excellent thank you and just loved it !value for money too it’s worth product is also superb .
2,After 2 weeks of Delay due to some shipping issues because of some external errors I received the package with some dents and scratches probably used one or returned item(You can see the pics for proof). I’ve asked 3 times to seller(could be manufacturer himself) about the laptops weight capacity all 3 times received a positive response saying that it’d hold my laptop as such. But after things are being assembled(thanks for detailed and clear instructions) I found out that laptop stand goes down to the table though things are fitted properly. Here comes the monitor arm issue. As the mount bracket and it’s holder doesn’t have proper gripping monitor is facing downwards a bit. Am not sure whether to expect a perfection for this price or the product should justify the price.
5,"Writing the review after 1 month use.Took at least an hour to fully assemble.It is a VFM product , very sturdy.However, laptop tray not very strong enough, shakes if used laptop keyboard.Got it for Rs 4,150.I would recommend this for all who works on two screens."
5,"Sturdy, supports as stated. Good enough for 20 to 24-inch monitors and a decent size laptop. The typing angle is a bit odd but then the whole idea is to get away from the screen as much as possible which means there should be an external keyboard and mouse to support. Which is good since gives a very ergonomic posture and sitting. Screens are on eye level and you need to bend too much giving you a pain-free back after 10 to 11 hours of screen time. Recommended for IT and ITES folks, who have a normal screen time of 10 to 12 hours a day."
5,"I was hesitant given that similar models were available for 10k INR. The make is top notch and you can tell by the weight (its heavy!). Assembly takes a bit of effort depending on where you are fixing it. The only thing I miss in this model is the ability to adjust height without having to mess around with the screws. A few plastic items are included to manage cables and secure the laptop - they are of very low quality, but they don't impact the overall structure of the mount so no concerns there. 10/10 would recommend."
5,This is a great product. Robust and reliable.It comes with a user manual to install as per your need.Provides an ease to office table and lots of space for other stuffs. With adjustable height you can adjust it for standing position in order to keep your spine healthy.It’s a must product of every office table.
4,"I had a small computer desk i needed a extra monitor for my laptop since bought this product now everything fits well i have a 27 inch monitor and 15 inch laptop both are now adjusted will enough space for keyboard, mouse and a  coffee mug :) , only con is its bit complex to install took me more than a hour to align properly, but once set its all good."
5,Great Value for Money Product... Buy it before it gets famous and expensive :)Quality is top notch and price is very less if compared with other...Thumbs Up!!!
5,Excellent productNeatly engineered productI really find this product perfectly crafted so that both laptop and monitor hold without any issue.This product carries some heavy weight-strong parts and it has received with well and complete packaged.superb....Solved lots of issue on my work stationThanks a lot
5,This is the first purchase I did for Lumi stands. Work from home changed for me once I installed the stand. Allowing complete ergonomics for long hours while still being able to focus on work.Thank you merchant for your support and service.
5,"best at this price point. used it for a day now, assembling is a fun DIY, sterdy and got a lot of table space after installation! worth the investment"
4,Good and sturdy. One of the hinges is loose and it can't be tightened so the laptop slides to one corner and does not stay in the place.
5,"The lumi brateck pairs laptop and pc screens perfectly to make working from home a piece of cake. It's strong, easy to install and offers plenty of flexibility. Making zooms calls, learning online, researching for articles an enjoyable and relaxed experience. Go for it if you need a command centre experience!"
5,The product looks and feels premium. The build quality is great and the instructions for assembly are simply and easy to follow.
1,"Missing a parts(screws M,O,L)  poor packaging"
5,"Excellent product, strong and sturdy. It has small compliance but overall very great. Saved a lot of space on my desk"
5,"Good. Assembly is tough,but worth it. Instructions ought to be more simpler."
5,Good. Heavy duty and functions well.
5,Received product as detailed on the page. Happy with the ergonomics arrangements finally.
5,Using this i have easily organized my workstation. Nice product Highly Recommended
5,"Really sturdy, I trust it with my Mac ! Handles 6kg monitor really well ."
5,Heavy quality metal and paint.
5,Easy to build and well documented. Good quality
1,THIS PRODUCT IS VERY VERY VERY BAD.
5,"So many reasons to prefer EW2480 over the GW2480 but a GW2480 is cheaper and can also get the work done.HDRi / HDR emulated is not very impressive. The ePaper mode can be useful if you are into reading.For Gaming this one is better than GW2480 (75Hz, FreeSync)Speaker is okayish but better than GW2480, expect normal here.EW2480 is Certified Mac Compatible but GW2480 is not.Full HD 24inch Screen is better than a FullHD 27inch Screen. For a 27inch Screen you need atleast QuadHD or 4K."
5,One of the best monitors you can buy under 13k. Its great for CAD work. Had purchased GW2780 and returned it twice for non-uniform backlight and dead pixel issues. The first EW2480 came with backlight bleed of the left side of the screen. Gave a last chance to BenQ and requested a replacement. The replacement piece is great. I have almost no backlight bleed on this monitor. Feels like winning a lottery after three replacements :)  One thing I noticed is that the blacks were definitely better on the GW2780 with almost no IPS glow. EW2480 has a fair amount of IPS glow. I don't mind the IPS glow as 95 % of the time I will be viewing the monitor straight. The bezels are also slimmer than the GW series.  HDRi is awesome and so are the 2.5 x 2 speakers ( treVolo ). Text sharpness is decent as it has a matte finish. Eye care mode is great. The monitor is slimmer than the GW series and also looks better for sure with the HDRi logo and rounded rectangular stand. I have a Nvidia card and the monitor is detected as HDMI TV by default @ 60Hz. If you buy this monitor make sure that you set it at 1920x1080 @ 75hz PC mode from Nvidia Control panel. Appario Retail is a highly recommended seller and most of the stuff I buy comes from this seller. Monitor replacement was smooth process !
1,Video Player is loading.
4,"Amazing picture quality, especially HDR. Windows 10 supports HDR out of the box, with all HDR features including content streaming enabled. There's also a dedicated HDR button to switch between HDR, Cinema HDRi (HDR slightly tuned for movies) and Standard. The inbuilt speakers are awesome, far better than any laptop speakers I've ever tried. 75hz also works well with almost no ghosting.Cons:The brightness intelligence (auto brightness) is often a bit on the higher side, I think it can be further tuned.There's also a tad bit of screen bleeding on the left side when viewing a black screen at high brightness."
4,Bought this monitor in the nonth of Jan from amazon.last week when I set up thjs monitor in a new place when I tilt the monitor my hand was touched in the IPS panel and it got affected.when I called the customer care they sent some service engineer and check and they came back it does not cover in warranty.i was very much worried . since it is only 6 months  they said it is not covered under warranty and it will be provided for 36 momths
5,"Superb quality image. The HDRi sharpens the image quite a bit and adds exposure. So it is not optimum for all the videos that you might be watching. But, the normal image is good enough that I don't need to switch on HDRi modes.The eyecare works very well. I work in night with lights switched off and yet my eyes don't gets stressed. Auto-brightness mode also works great!Also, the installation of the monitor base is so easy and doesn't require any screw driver, which is great in my opinion. the heavy metal base gives an extra bit of confidence.I paid a bit more than my planned budget for this monitor. However, I don't regret it."
4,"I bought this monitor after testing Dell P2419h, GW2283 (yeah 21.5' one) and must say found it better in terms of a mixed use cases, WFH, Training videos (speakers has sufficient loudness), YouTube etc. Text fuzziness issue is kind of non-existent so yes developers can consider* it.*However here i must say Benq has serious quality control issue and it depend on your luck if can get a unit without severe screen bleeding or without a few bright pixels....the current unit has acceptable level of screen bleed or IPS glow but still with one bright pixel at left upper corner which i would prefer to ignore.Lastly, really appreciate Amazon for hassle free return/replacements...Thank you!"
5,"A good quality display, if it is to mention in a single line. Decent colour accuracy in this price segment.Pros :No backlight bleeding compared to other ips panels75hz free sync supported displayAnti glare coatingLow power consumption and eye care modesBi technologyHdr emulationHDCP 2.2 support and hdmi 2.0 portGood viewing anglesCons:Not much connectivity options.. only has hdmi portsSpeakers are not very loud.. but sound quality is okSlighty pricy model.. i would say.Not a real hdr..only emulation.. so windows wont detect a hdr display."
4,"Color reproduction - Good.Brightness - Decent.Color uniformity - OK.Bezel - Excellent.HDR - Emulated.Sound - Good.I have ordered this monitor after a lot of research. Couldn't find anything better at this price.Windows recognizes this monitor as a 75 Hz HDR display. However, this is not an actual HDR display. It does not have a HDR certification and the IPS panel supports peak brightness of 350 nits. But it artificially adjusts the contrast and color to produce a HDR like output. To my surprise, this works nicely for some video content.Overall, It's an amazing budget option and probably the best in this price category in 2020."
5,The product is good no doubt about it already lot of info and feedback is provided so I am not writing it anything new . The only thing i would like to mention that you need a 15 amp plug to connect the monitor or you can use a 5 to 15 amp converter which cost hardly Rs 100 rather than extension cord of 15 amp which cost rs approx 500
4,The screen is great for working watching netflix or prime or youtube. Connect a tv stick and you will have a spare tv... controls are not always straightforward i prefer the controls on lg monitors. Sound quality is just ok with 2.5 speakers its decent if you are close to the monitor but not good in some cases when u are sitting back. Overall with 3 hdmi ports and hdr this screen will look the best you can connect a Bluetooth speaker with the audio out and it should work fine.
4,"its 8bit. This HDR is fake. Its more of software based. But its not bad.You will see very good pictures while gaming. But not suitable in dark regions of game. You have to constantly turn it on and off. Not suitable for movies at all, unless whole movie shooting took place in daylight (No night scenes)."
4,"I will first write the cons except which this is a great great purchase.Cons:1. Sound (not really good, but at least it is there, you have an audio out jack)2. Stand: no height adjustment + swivel + rotate. Pretty basic one. VESA mount holes are there which is a big plus.Something to just note which isn't that obvious but it's there in the product listing that this scree offers ""emulate HDR"" not real HDR. I feel that the cinema HDR emulation mode offers good viewing experience.Other than that this is a fantastic screen. Must buy at this price (11-13k)."
2,"After thorough research and lot of waiting, was able to order the EW280.There is a supply shortage for this model, both, online and offline.Ordered on: Sept 1, 2020Seller: Appario Retial Private Limited. (at this point, this is the only seller on amazon.in selling this model)Price: INR 12,990.Arrived on: Sept 5 (as planned)Packaging:The amazon box packaging that it came in was damaged in transit, however, the product packaging box inside it was fine. Product was seal packed in manufacturer's packaging.Product build & finish:Out of the box, this product is great, premium looks.However, there was an uneven gap (<1mm) between the screen and the bottom strip of the monitor (where all buttons are mounted).Usability and features:Had bought this product over other brands for its features in this price range -1. BITech+ (Blue light control, auto flicker free, auto brightness and temperature control) - Works like a charm.2. HDRi - Did not test it with HDR source, however, when switched ON, the HD video becomes HDR emulated. This feature is basically, HDR enabled with BITech+.3. Pre-built brightness modes are great and work like a charm.4. Works flawlessly with Macbook.OSD navigation:The OSD menu and buttons are self-explanatory and easy to use.Two of these buttons are customizable shortcut keys.However, you will have to google for and download, user manual for better understanding, in case you don't have a CD drive. User manual comes on a CD pre-packaged.Sound:The speakers are good enough for monitor speakers. They hold good on max volume too. One will need to switch between the 3 mode equalizer - Voice/Dialog, Pop/Live, Cinema, depending on the need.The Disappointment:First thing I noticed after switching it ON and pulling out full screen notepad - There was a particle lodged inside the panel; it moved a little with gentle tapping near it.Very next day I have initiated return, however, would really be needing a new replacement."
5,Good monitor for work. Clear images and brightness. It comes with a 15 amp plug cord  but it also works perfectly fine with a 5 amp cord (usually used in printers) You can buy that for cheap from any computer shop or try your luck with asking the manufacturer.
4,I have ended up purchasing BENQ EW2480 over Dell P2419H and LG 24ML600M-S after a lot of research. I got this product for Rs 10791 (Republic Day Sale). Here are the things which I like about this Desktop.Pros:1) Intelligent Brightness (sensor induced)2) Slim with 3 HDMI ports3) Pixels are not noticeable i.e 92 PPI4) Color accurate5) Stereo speakers are loud and clear and does the job for most people6) HDRi (gimmick though) HDR works fine and exaggerates well and looks a lot vibrant which can be used for multimedia consumption. iCinema is an over-exaggeration of HDR not to my liking.7) Full HD for a 24-inch monitor is decent. 22 inch looks for sharper than 24 inches (102 PPI); 27 inches at Full HD may look pixelated.8) No Backlight Bleed at all.Cons:1) No height adjustment and swivel function on the stand. It is just a fixed stand that can do tilt up-down.2) No USB support3) For fully functional HDR the screen brightness should atleast reach 400 nits. The black on HDR looks crushed and the whites are blown out.
4,"The picture quality is great when you set it to a setting of your liking (lot of options to customize)However, this display kind of hurts to the eyes, don't know why that is, but perhaps it may be the eyes getting used to a new display.The HDR is a hit or miss, sometimes the picture looks better with it on and sometimes the other way round."
2,"Everything was great until I observed a horizontal line in the screen after 6 hours of use after it was delivered to me. Intiallally, it looked great but a purple color line appeared on the screen. I am not able to see any replacement option after I have purchased this. It's hardly been 12 hours since the product delivered to me."
1,"Defective product received 2 times in a row very higely disappointed finaly ending up for refund ....The Monitor is very good but it is overpriced it should be under 10k picture quality is very good i think better than Lg samsung ..Cons- The power plug is a 16amp socket which ia generally used by Very heavy applian like AC , Geyser..and it will not fit in regular 5amp socket you have to buy connector for it like in the pic rest is all good..."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,"Overall a good product for the price. FHD works well on 24"". But some things you should know about.Cons:1. I also had the power adapter issue mentioned here in the comments. It's too big and you'll need a separate adapter to plug it into a normal socket. Luckily my old PS3's power cable was able to substitute. Otherwise it's another purchase.2. The supposed auto brightness feature that is there does not work well. Apparently they don't just detect the ambient light to determine the brightness level, resulting in brighter-thab-needed screens most of the time. Kind of a bummer because I was looking forward to this feature.3. The fact that only HDMI ports are available, means that you won't be able to connect mouse, keyboard, led strip to the screen in case u were planning to.Other than these complaints, the rest holds good.The speakers are surprisingly loud for 5W. I advise you not to overuse them though.Once I found the right brightness for me, I could sit through for hours without trouble. I guess the low blue light filter n all are at play.The HDRi feature works well for some content, and it's a welcome gimmick."
5,"*Perfect for a budget need monitor display*Thanks Benq this is what I was looking for. Not many products out there that gives many features like in built speakers, multi hdmi ports plus the vesa mount combo.The product works like a charm if you want to use it as an additional computer monitor or a wall mount tv or info display.In terms of performance  ,response rate is pretty good seamless, and no color bleeds in edges or unusual contrast in different viewing angles.Cons: the only con I could think of is it doesn't have swivel function but only up and down adjust."
5,"Very good monitor ar this price point. I am not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance. But brightness and contrast is very good and particularly its eye care technology. It really adjusts brightness in relation to ambient light so that eye does not strain. A very important feature for someone with thick glasses like me. As regards long term performance, only time will tell."
2,"This review is for a purchase made on Aug 2021. By September 2021, dead pixel lines started showing up on screen, literally one month after purchase. These will eventually lead to a dead monitor. On calling customer care and emailing them multiple times - they eventually said that they would replace it, but no replacement ever came. BenQ doesn't respond to emails when you send it.They give excuses such as 'we have no stock' and yet on Amazon stores it is clearly visible that there is stock for sale. Basically there is no ownership and lack of taking responsibility for faulty products.If you purchase from BenQ, be prepared for these kind of hassles. I've had Samsung and LG monitors and I've never faced any problems with those companies, specially regarding aftersales service. BenQ has the poorest after sales service I've seen in a long time.1/10."
1,9th July 2021 this product delivery to me and next when i full set up my pc and then set to monitor and open my monitor screen seen white...and seen nothing... immediately I replacement that product and tomorrow will be replaced my product..and let see what see that product...
5,"Absolutely stunning. Tonnes of research doesnt go in vain. Perfect for a designer like me with strict budget.Go for it. Great colors, good brighness, little issue with color exggeration when HDR turned on. Overall fab purchase. Go for it without a second thought if you are a designer."
1,Poor quality monitor. Please go for quality products.Black dot spotted in monitor screen and warranty claim rejected because the warranty claim applicable when there is more than 5 black dots. My other LG monitors are working perfectly without any problems
2,HDR is a emulation.Sound speaker is okay.Most of the time red dots suddenly appears. You have to unplug the HDMI cable from PC and reconnect two or three times for the dots to disappear.
4,"Perfect product for general productivity. Using it as a secondary monitor and it works like a charm. Color gamut is balanced, quick changes can be made from normal to HDR mode using a separate button. IPS panel is great in terms of viewing angle."
4,"This monitor delivers what it promises.Perfect in this price range loaded with all necessary features. Note that this marketed as a multimedia monitor with a refresh rate of 75 HZ with AMD Freesync. It is not specifically a gaming monitor. If you intend to just play multiplayer FPS games, you should go for higher refresh monitor.Picture quality and colors - GoodFeatures - GoodProgramming - GoodWeb Surfing - GoodGaming - OK (Good for casual gaming)"
4,"Don't expect a great deal about of this. It's an amazing looking budget 4k monitor:The Good:1) The color reproduction is excellent.2) Considering its a IPS panel, the viewing angles are also great.3) The almost frameless design on 3 sides look very good.4) The stand is sturdy and looks good.5) The monitor can be moved up and down vertically -5 degree to +20 (approx), and that's it, no swivel or rotation. (so this point is a mix of good and bad)6)  Comes with an HDMI cable in the box.7) The finishing of the monitor is top notch, the plastic used looks very premium.8) The inbuilt speakers are facing downwards and are loud enough for you to hear an office ping from the other room.9) The mat finish screen doesn't reflect window lights at all. While I can fix my hair looking at my Macbook pro screen, this monitor doesn't reflect anything at all.The bad:1) The 4k videos doesn't look great, at most it looks a 2k video, which isn't too bad though considering what you are paying.2) There is a lot of text ghosting while scrolling down a page.3) The HDMI connection supports 30 hertz. Only display cable supports the 60 hertz (display port cable is not included in the package).The HDR is just a gimmick : With 300 nits of brightness HDR is useless. Deal breaker for PS4 pro users.4) The 4ms response time coupled with 60 hertz is definitely not a gaming monitor.5) The dynamic contrast is sometimes very annoying. Going back and forth on brightening up the screen and then going dark again. I turned this off, but the annoyance still continues while watching Netflix, not sure if the monitor is to be blamed or Netflix.Surprisingly this exact model is sold in the US and UK at 1ms response time panel, with the exact same model number. Not sure what happened there. In the US it is sold for $329.99 which is almost the same as the INR price in India.I did a monitor test in EIZO and there's no screen bleeding or defective pixels.It can be mounted on a VESA stand of 100mm.It is definitely not a gaming monitor, a perfectly fine monitor for work, and good monitor for photo editing. (the colors are pretty accurate)Overall ,If you consider the other 4k monitors available at this price point, this is actually a great deal."
4,"absolute best monitor in this price range! I have read one comment saying that HDMI doesn't support 4k 60 and the ghosting effect. but I can say for sure it supports 4k 60 with HDMI, you just have to have the powerful graphics to support this. and ghosting can be removed by disabling super sharpness and turned the gaming profile to normal not extreme setting in the monitor.Overall one of the best monitor to buy.the only downside is. it has a 4ms response time, And Idk HDR not so great."
1,"Edit - Monitor has developed image retention/burn in after a year. Be careful this is common with Acer displays which I came to know now.Acer has released an absolute Value for money product. Excellent colors with IPS 10bit panel, freesync/Gsync and HDR10.In order to make HDR work properly on windows follow this method -Enable HDR in monitor and windows both, enable hdr streaming, reduce the sdr brightness in windows to 15-20, In Nvidia control panel set brightness 40 - contrast 60 - Digital Vibrance 55. Now you can watch contents in amazing 4kHDR and SDR content won't burn your eyes or look flat. Directx 12 games supporting hdr, Youtube 4k hdr and netflix 4k hdr looks spectacular.Also please note Gsync does work with this monitor with display port cable, i am using a 1080ti. Please lock framerates below 60fps(57/58) to make Gsync work properly. Don't let the frames go higher than your monitor refresh rate of 60, otherwise you may notice tearing even when gysnc is on.If you are working with 3d/graphics applications the 10 bit panel will work wonders, enable 10bit mode from nvidia control panel for best color reproduction. And download and install monitor drivers fro. Acer website."
5,"Initial feedback the monitor is great. The real-estate you get when working is amazing. Will update more pictures and info on how it is behavingFor the price point I would say its value for money4k @60 hertz, brightness is enough I am running on 70% brightness and quite readable for work, speakers are not out of the world can manage.Will connect my ps4 pro and give some more update as to how its w.r.t gaming."
5,"I just received today (September 24th) this is my first 4K monitor and so far I am quite excited and happy with the product, it fits my budget also(24999).I am still experiencing 4K 😎If I face any issues in near future I will surely be sharing.I got this monitor to edit video and play some games.If you are still reading than let me tell you about packaging.It came in very good packaging and carefully handled.Now viewing setup guide.Out of the box color might get little dark so try using below(my opinion) or as per your color requirements.For Movies -Brightness -100Contrast - 100Black boost -10NORMAL USEBrightness -50Contrast - 70Black boost -10If anyone of you have better suggestions please reply on this.Thanks for reading people."
4,"pros:1.i was worried about the 300 nits brightness, but turned out it's enough when working up close. 2.there's a HDR mode that makes the color pop.3. price is cheap for a 4k 28 inch4. bezels are less around so best for 16:9 contentcons: 1. hdmi port will only supports 4k at 30fps.2. the power plug is 16amp so if u dont have a 16 amp port you'll need a converter.3. stand is wobbly and might shake even at small bumps on the table."
4,"I got the Acer Nitro specifically for my PS5 after some extensive reading online and research on other 4k monitors. I was thoroughly impressed with good the monitor was for the cost it was being offered for. I’ll start with some minor cons and then go for the pro’sCons --The stand could have been better with a swivel option-HDR on this monitor is neither a deal breaker nor a game changer.-Missing 1 ms response time. The UK model of the same offers 1ms response time for the same price.Pro’s-Value for money. Bang on for every penny you spend-Display quality is phenomenal-No backlight bleeding-The colours really stand out and I was impressed that it was possible in a much cheaper monitor-Very sleek and slim bezels and overall look/feel-Watching 4k Movies on Netflix and HDR content in general were good-4k 60 fps definitely works but you will need a high speed HDMI cable for it. I used the high speed one which comes with the PS5 in the box.Gameplay wise I tried Demon’s souls on 4k 60 fps on performance mode and 4k 30fps on Graphics mode with Ray tracing on. The game looked absolutely impressive on both modes and I ended up playing the game on 4k 60 fps for that extra butter smooth performance.Overall, I will give it a 4/5. It’s a superb monitor and if you are looking for a 4k display for gaming without stretching your pockets too much, this one is it. However, the lack of 1ms response time maybe a deal breaker for a few. The HDR does the job is all I can say, it is not the best nor the best. Overall a superb monitor I will definitely recommend for gaming for a budget friendly PC user or for any next generation console user."
2,Not provided display port ..this is very bad and I purchased 4 types of DP port to HDMI cable but not supported  so I am not satisfied for that and speed also laged on hdmi connecting
5,"Best for Laparoscopy with true colours, I  had earlier used Dell series 2007 fpb, U2412M, U2415 they all performed very well and this Acer is equally good, I used factory settings which provided true colors and adequate brightness with very high clearity. Although it lacks height adjustment and rotation but it doesn't matter much. You will get great performance at reasonable cost, similar product is from Dell is 3 times costly."
5,"Its a great monitor. I've been using it for 2 days. Earlier I was confused whether I should go for samsung or lg in the same price range of 2k monitor which is less expensive. But I'm glad I went ahead with this monitor. It has great colors, easy to eyes, clear and crisp text. I have just one complaint, there seems to be no software with this monitor which lets you control brightness from the laptop and also the minimum brightness is sometimes too high especially when you are working at night but its not a big deal, that's why I gave it 5 star."
5,"It's an excellent monitor at this price point, especially considering its 4K.The speakers could've been a tiny bit better, but what else would you expect honestly.The brightness is very good. The display is also amazing.I have seen a ton of reviews about ""light bleeding"", but it's not much of a problem. I would even say it is not a problem at all.It's great if you want to buy it for school, gaming, or even general work.Overall, 5 outta 5."
5,"I completed my dual 4K setup with my second purchase of this beauty! Bright, crisp display, decent colors. I mostly use it for coding with the occasional Photoshop/Lightroom work. The default stand is a bit wobbly. I mounted mine on a rock solid VESA mount. Overall, 5/5, would recommend."
5,I just got it today. So far so good! The best 4k monitor available for 25k. I would recommend
5,Overall its a Great Package Especially of console User .....For other detail check tech recker gaming
5,"Get a good quality DP cable and you are good to go.Speaker isn't great as expected, but the brightness and display quality are very good for the price"
5,Best at this cost
5,Value for money 💰
5,Good value for money
5,Great product
4,"Monitor with 4k compatibility, various features to control brightness, contrast, modes such as HDR, Action, Gaming. Lightweight and seems to be strongly built. The adaptor is of larger size plug so we had to install a new plug box.Looks great if setup with a laptop or pc on a table. This monitor had arrived earlier than tentative date, happily received even during the curfew. Thanks to the delivery officer."
4,"Good product, minor issue with corner bleeding other wise best product.I not gammer I used it for chart studies. Preferred 4K due to high resolution and more viewing area."
5,"Good product was looking for this to cover my spare LG ultrawide 32 inches when not in use, it fits perfectly. There is a decent amount of thickness to the cover and it is not thin or flimsy, though stitching could be better but looks it will hold over time."
2,Not as described. Its not a snug fit. Back side is half  the cloth. Open from sides too See images
5,"It's a very well done piece. It's well stitched,m sturdy, elegant and fit perfectly the wide monitor"
5,Superb quality as always
5,"Nice product,  good quality! You must have if you have 27""."
5,It’s an absolute must have
1,Misleading product image
1,"Please do dead pixel test after getting this monitor. I observed after the return date. I raised a request with Benq India for EW2780 dead pixel issue - R200800739. They said as ""As per BenQ Pixel policy it will not support under warranty"".I don't know now what to do. If anyone faced same kind of issue and resolved the problem, please share details."
5,I would like to say it is the best monitor in this budget. Few things that I would highlight:Excellent displayNo grey spotsI am not a gamer so wont comment on that.My use is mostly for office work.You can read the documents very easily without any eye strain.Though it is a 27 inch screen but no blurring effect.Amazon delivery is just too good.
5,"Before buying this monitor for my home office, I had to do a full research on what would best suit my needs. I’m not a gamer, so I needed a monitor that’s good for web surfing, working and occasionally watching YouTube/Netflix.This is a 27 inch 1080p HDRi monitor. The highest recommended size for 1080p would be 24 inch monitors but as I occasionally watch movies, I had to push it by a bit. It’s a fair trade off for me because 2k/4K monitors are substantially more expensive than this one.Now coming to review of this product, initially I received a faulty product which was replaced by amazon within a day. Apart from that, the monitor has some really nice features that are hard to find like ambient light sensor that works really well, low blue light filter. Both these features really help me reduce eye fatigue post sunset. Apart from that there’s a hot key for changing the mode from low blue light to HDRi and suddenly everything is vibrant and good for watching YouTube/Netflix.The monitor also has timer which pops up nicely in the bottom left corner reminding us to take breaks in the intervals that we choose from the available options.While this monitor also comes with inbuilt speakers, I haven’t used them much as I have external 5.1 speakers. One thing that I noticed is the inbuilt speakers are louder and sound better than my work laptop.Apart from this, the panel is matte finish and doesn’t have any reflections, and the monitor height is also decent provided you are an average height person. For someone that’s taller than 6 feet, they might need a VESA stand to adjust the height of the monitor to avoid strain on neck."
4,"I won't give a technical review, you can find that in couple of other review posts. I will be posting what I did not find in other posts or something of value in my own experience of purchase.1. Audio quality is good not great because of the limited volume. Given you are going to use it as an extended monitor or nearby PlayStation experience the volume should suffice. For a rich music experience, you might need to plug into a set of external speakers.2. The monitor mount is metallic and very sturdy. Nice and sleek.3. I had to raise an exchange due to the issue of light bleeding and the exchange turned out to be fine. Although, I am pretty sure the seller tried to ship me a defective unit for the first time. For the first time, the seal tape by BenQ visible in the attached image was missing. The seller in my case was Appario Retail Private Ltd.4. I started from a sub 10k budget and pushed to this monitor for 16.5K on a strong recommendation by a friend and I am glad I did it.The sweetest deal for this price."
1,"Product wise it is amazing as my friend is using the same one from the past one year and that was the reason for me to buy this. I have ordered the product the product on July 27 and we have received in a week or two but I have unboxed it recently as the last date of replacement was Aug 7,2021 I am unable to replace the product even the customer care was not accepting this. How this problem can be solved as I am not a youtuber to do unboxing video to prove that the product was damaged in packing or shipping. Hope the team will understand my problem and provide a replacement."
5,"I have been using this monitor for a month now for my home office. This i must say is an awesome monitor and does the job perfectly. 27 inch size is pretty good for your work. I found monitors from other company with almost same functions at much higher price. I am happy to have this one. 36 months warranty is good enough, though competitors are also giving the same warranty. Although monitor is not meant for audio but i found audio quality decent enough. I can attend my meetings without headset using monitor's audio. Overall a good deal, if someone is planning to buy a monitor go for it without second thought."
1,"It has a very dim display panel, not suitable to be used in a well lit room, irrespective of day or night. Colour reproduction is awry, whites appear grey, no colour calibration of any kind. I am very disappointed with this EW2780 monitor. It is waste of money, not reconnended at all.  This monitor does not even compete with significantly lower priced monitor e.g. Lenovo, ones wich cost around 10K which I am using in our office.Since, there is no straight option to return it, I tried to rectify these issues by all possible settings i.e. from montior and PC software/driver.  But it could not come close to even my laptop screen display reproduction, which is by the way a TFT screen and not an IPS.I previously had an LG 27"" FHD monitor which worked great but it did not age well. After 5 years of usage, the brightness got dim and it developed a vertical line in the middle which intermittently appeared at times. Still, it had a good run and i was happy with the purchase. Personally, I am okay to compromise on such con than living every day with very bad colour reproduction, significantly low brightness and really bad colour calibration out of the box.I would recommend to choose LG monitors instead of Benq. Even though the IPS glow is more evedent in LG monitors than the Benq one, but this con is nothing compared to what issues we get with Benq EW2780.I went through a lot of trouble but got my Benq monitor return approved. After this, I purchased an LG monitor with which I am very happy. One more suggestion I could give is to go for panel brightness no less than 350 nits and if budget permits go for QHD monitor."
1,"Packaging is not bad.Display, Appearance wise quality is good...But never expected screen bleeding issue from benQ.Little bit disappointed. Bcz I never returned a product from Amazon...Service from Amazon is great, they listened to my complaints patiently & initiated returns & assured Refund.."
5,"Go blindly for BenQ products due to their sheer durability. 21.5"" monitor lasted 5 years and 2 laptops. This is a thin monitor with extremely sharp picture quality and focus. Multiple inbuilt viewing modes give a pleasurable viewing experience. I have both the benq 27"" models - with HDR (this one) and without HDR(GW model). I would suggest go for this one for a superior experience."
4,Monitor is good for movie watching. It has good sound. Lot of colors.But if you are planning to work/code with it. then I would suggest to go for other monitor and not this one.
5,"power cords of benq are very big 3pin and It usually won't fit Normal 3 pin socket that we have in Indian houses. Buy a connector from ur local electrical shop and you're good to go.Cona 3 pin Universal connector will cost u around 150bucks.Refer the pic..And you're welcome..Monitor is good. I used it for coding, photo editing and video editing.. all in one with hdr features.Advantages. :SlimNo edge screenIn built speakersmultiple HDMI portHdr-iDisadvantages :Cannot be rotated 180°No webcam."
5,"I didn't need 4k or 144hz refresh rate. I wanted a simple monitor with good colour and 1080p. And I found this. This has HDRi as well. It is perfect. Has 3 hdmi inputs..if I want to shift from windows to my mac, its hassle-free. ...even I can quickly shift to my gaming console. The screen is tiltable and can be easily adjusted to the viewing angle. Overall very good product. Very very easy to set it up in the provided stand. And looks very modern."
5,I recently switched from samsung 22inch to Benq 27inch and the change is noticeable. Brilliant color reproduction and sharpness. If you want to step up from samsung or LG then this will be the right choice. This screen may not satisfy a pro gamer but it definitely provide a good gaming experience for gamers like me. I mostly do the designing and video editing work and for that this screen is absolutely perfect.
4,"Overall it's a nice product in this price range, the build quality is clean and finish is good, the placement of buttons and cable ports are neat, though it has speakers, I prefer my 2.1 Bose, so don't want to comment on the sound. Font readability is crips and good, image reproduction is good, only I will suggest that the Color reproduction is good but that great when compared to my Dell UltraSharp, hence I am using this Monitor as secondary, as I deal mostly with colors."
3,"Pros:HDR support and multiple display features like eye care etc.Good refresh rate of 75Hz.Built in speakerCons:Display quality is not that good, some pixel distortion can be seen.Considering the features provided under this price range, you can go for it."
5,"The product is amazing keeping price in mind, I purchase lg ultrawide monitor previously but that has few cons such as no speaker, eye strain protection and somehow the length of monitor though that was clearly mentioned as ultrawide.Benq offer nearly everything you need, it is  bright and vibrant, also, it has a setting as text for reading. Honestly, i feeel i should have consider benq rather than lg ultrawide, it is total value for money, just great product go for it."
5,"After 1 month of usage, I can surely say this is the best budget monitor you can get in this range.The colors are mesmerising, HDR doesn't wash the image up if it is supported by the stream. Brightness and Contrast can be a little too high for low brightness users like me. Rec.709 mode is the best color mode to get perfect blacks and minimal backlight bleed.Does suffer from backlight bleed (so does a 1L+ alienware) but is not visible in a dimply or brightly lit room. You can only notice it if you are looking at a pitch black screen in a dark room and searching for it. IPS glow is minimal and not prevalent in games or a lit room.Refresh rate is 60HZ so not recommended for FPS gaming especially if your system can give more than 60 HZ. I play Cyberpunk2077 and GTA V on it and I can say that you will get that zowie (Benq's gaming range) feel with the right settings.Does support upto 75HZ as exposed by some tweaking softwares but would not recommend overclocking as it would void the warranty.For development purposes, the standard stand hight is efficient for viewing colors at the correct angles and swivelling is also less sensitive so you can swivel it down a bit if you are getting too much glow.For watching movies, well if you want immersive images, Cinema HDRi will bring that cinema feel to you and it doesn't hurt the eye as well. Otherwise rec.709 is recommended for dark and horror movies.From a Gamer and a developer's point of view, just go for it."
4,"I have been using it for the past 10 days.Picture quality is good. I personally dont use HDR content looks quite saturated. Used it with PS4, It detects HDR enjoyed gaming on it. Only thing I didn’t liked is monitor controls LG’s is a lottt better.Pro tip don’t sit too close to the display you might see pixels as it is 1080p display.There are two 2.5w speakers very good sound compared to laptops inbuild speakers.Stand is only tilt adjustable."
3,Best qualities:brightness intelligence - helps to set reminder for eye protection and automatically adjusts the brightness according to the room light.Ease of use - multi-picture mode. You can set mode according to the usage that would give you appropriate brightness and blue light managementThings which are not good:Sound quality is not so great. highest volume is 50% that u can hear it feebly only around 50mts when  your atmosphere is quiet. otherwise volume is very low. If you are looking for some monitor which has good sound quality then you should consider other products. Otherwise this is great to office work usage.
5,Very Good monitor with great picture quality and speaker output is also decent better than My LG 24 inch
4,Out of the box issue is the AC plug is 16amp one where as in general most home appliances require 6amps plug point. Rest all is good. Please note there is no height adjustment on this monitor.
1,The screen looks like patchy ! It looks like there is cloth behindThis monitor HDR is nothing but oversaturationThey can't claim it as HDR !It's not even HDR1027 inches screen with 1080 p resolution is like over scaling ! Also heavy backlight as it's an LCD screen
1,"I bought it on a sale after saving up money only to get a damaged monitor used by someone else. After weeks of wasting my time and now another week to return and refund, I get nothing back. This was a pathetic experience and amazon does not want to be responsible in anyway.The monitor itself was good and I will buy this one properly at a local store, albeit at a higher price. I lost my trust on Amazon after 5 years. Will update the review again in the future if any changes are madeEdit 1: They took the monitor back and offered a refund but they didnt do a replacement like I asked. Immediately after I returned it, the deal was again active with a single piece! It seems they resold the used monitor they sent to me as new again to someone else!!"
5,I simply loved this monitor. Before I had LG 27uk850 which is a bad monitor and had light bleeding issues so I had returned that monitor. But now this monitor is beautiful and I am using it with my MacBook Pro and with imac also. Yes it's not upto the level of MacBook Pro or IMac retina screens but still it gives very good output with MacBook Pro.I have not purchased the USB c version because don't want to charge my MacBook Pro from usb c cable which I think 60w and can damage your MacBook Pro in future with regular charges so I opted for this model and using the display port ( have to purchased it separately) and charging my laptop with the original power adapter by Apple.Cables: The HDMI  cable and display port cable which comes with the monitor have no use. They don't give the 60htz output and gives only 30htz which is laggy. So you have to purchase the proper 60htz cables. LG should provide the good quality cables which is the negative point of any Lg monitors.Light Bleeding: I am lucky that I didn't get any bleeding issues with this monitor but yes IPS glow is there which is a common thing with all IPS panels. Remember light bleeding and IPS Glow both are separate things because some people count IPS glow as bleeding issue.Monitor Stand. I don't like the stand ( which is a personal choice ) which came with it. Cant even move it to different positing properly so I have purchased the gas arm stand which is very smooth and your desk looks very clean with it.Overall I am very satisfied with the monitor.
5,"This is a very good 4k monitor from LG and for me it ticks all the boxes to be a great buy.PROS -1). Very bright (can reach upto 400 nits)2). On screen software is nice to control your monitor settings without using physical buttons .3). LG IPS panel -Colors are brilliant on this ips panel.4). Very minimal backlight bleed - Even though this is an ips panel the blacklight bleed is bare minimum.5). Design - very thin bezels gives you an immersive feel and stand is quite sturdy and very adjustable.I also think it lacks few things that I noticed.CONS -1). It lacks Swivel movement , so you have to move whole monitor with stand in your direction.2). HDR is not that effective .3). Even when I adjust its stand’s height to minimum, the monitor still feels to be placed at a high position .Also it was a great value for money at 28700/- effective price during Great Indian sale."
4,"First - 27 UL650 W is a value for money monitor, in price range of INR 29K.The Goods:- Super Bright - HDR 400 is super bright for any light conditions in working space- Magnificent Color accuracy, multifold quality over laptop screen- Build quality is great, white casing mean high grade plastic, and seems monitor is built to last- Prefer a minimal of UL550 or UL650 as minimal, as UL500 doesn't provide Hight adjustable stand, which is a MUST for todays ergonomics. Colour accuracy and Panel/hardware is different for UL500/UL550 Vs UL650/UL850 series.- Nominal LG Windows and Mac OS software is available for ease of configuration- Hopefully, Windows 11 will bring-in more advance feature as default, to do away reliance on LG- IPS is much better than VS / TN panels, if you need colors, quality across viewing angles.- 27 Inch is optimal size, Vs 32 Inch and 24/25 Inch - seems balanced to me.The Bads:- Possible light bleeding, depending on piece you get - is a known issue with IPS Panels. No matter how much you try to find a perfect monitor, you will end-up finding minor bleed, but I hope it should not compromise any of image quality in anyways- No provision of upstream and downstream USB Hub- Colour reproduction is 8 bit + 2 bit simulation = 10 bit, instead of real 10 bit colour production, like provided in BenQ PD2720Q or PD2700Q- Doesnt provide USB C connectivity as default, you will need a USB C Hub if at all your laptop/Mac device doesnt have HDMI portThe Blunders:- Power Adapter is a separate external unit, and not inbuilt to Monitor.- Speakers missing... so you cannot use this monitor with Amazon Stick, etc.The Ugly -- Monitor is bulky, in this NexGen technology age, design principle for Monitor is very old, no-way gives a premium look. This is an issue with all monitors I have seen, and not a sole LG problem.Check before you buy - (From my own experience)- Unless you are a Mac user, I find it very difficult to utilize the 4K design rendering, as I am using the screen on 150 DPI scaling, making it effective 2K Monitor for Windows.So I recommend to settle with a 2K monitor (BenQ 2700U), that will serve at-least 4-5 years, by which NextGen Monitors should arrive (OLED 4K Slim, Wifi, Screen Mirroring, etc. enabled by default)- BenQ Monitors provide Ture 10bit colour rendering Vs Lg's 8 bit + 2 bit FRC simulation- Your computer system should support 4K 60 FPS refresh rate as either system should be latest generation hardware, else you will end-up using 4K @ 30 FPS refresh rate - and you will not appreciate it once you procure this expensive 4K high-end monitor. So for my case, both - my office laptop and personal laptop are stuck at 4K 30 FPS refresh rate only.Recommendation - Go for BenQ 2700Q as it comes with True 10 bit color reproduction, better practical usage, USB upstream/downstream setup, advance design features, balanced 2K display instead of 4K setup, speakers for nominal usage.If at all you need a 4k display, LG 27 UL650 is decent value proposition, if you can afford much more, you can search for BenQ PD2720U 4k Display."
5,Pros  - Screen is really good  - Feels Premium  - Height adjustable  - Split screen also works download the driver from lg.com for this model. Pretty sweet feature.  - On screen function also works by downloading driver from lg.comCons-  On 4K resolution everything becomes so small it is not readable. I know this is the thing with every 4K monitor out there. So most of the time I keep the resolution at 2k for better readability.No in built speakerNo USB port
5,"I am totally satisfied with this monitor.The HDR isn't as pronounced as they say because it's HDR 400. But the the monitor has consistent colors and great color accuracy. The stand is very sturdy and has appropriate weight when doing all types of adjustments. It's a great stand after all. I would say unless you plan to buy a separate monitor stand, buying this UL650 model is highly recommended over the standard UL600 model of this monitor. Because the stand is well worth the money. The only complaint would be that it doesn't swivel left or right. But it can do literally every other movement we'll ever need.Let's talk about the overall build quality, it's just great. The vesa mount is very satisfying to use. The overall body of the monitor is made of good quality plastics. The white color looks really good.It comes with 1x HDMI cable, 1x Display Port Cable and a CD. The CD was not packed properly it was just thrown inside the box along with the warranty papers. I couldn't find the software to install that will make things even better. When searched on LG website it shows no software available for this monitor model. Or when I found one, the download link didn't work.Anyways, this is a great monitor and is well worth the money. 4K looks stunning. Unfortunately my laptop isn't very powerful to run 4k60 smoothly. I'll be using this monitor with my new PC build that is coming soon. Until then I'll be using it in 2K 60hz mode.It still looks great in 2K 60Hz.27 inches might be a bit too big for many but as a video editor, I find more space adding upto the convenience. You could go with the 24 inch ones but I couldn't find a good 24 inch 4k monitor that is color accurate and has good reviews.Also 27 inches seem to be the sweet spot for monitor size especially for productivity and it looks like 27 inches is a standard size.The colors are very vibrant and has many color settings presets.Straight out of the box everything looks stunning. And the display is matte so you don't have to deal with reflections.It is an overall great monitor with great value for money.One complaint I would say is that the headphone jack in the back of the monitor is flimsy and not of good quality. It sounds bad when the headphone is connected to that port. It sounds excellent when I connect directly to my laptop.So I wouldn't use that headphone jack. Anyway it's just a small thing.If you want pure audio quality don't use that headphone jack.If you want pure picture quality this is the monitor to go at this price range.I'm very happy that I chose this.I will update the review if something goes wrong in the future."
4,"After spending a 10 days of doing extensive research, I bought this LG computer monitor for coding, and love the clarity. text look crisp and clear. It's reader mode is fantastic for working for long hours, as I spend 8-9 hours per day for office work and 0% strain to eyes. Some of it's unique features such as pivot, dual controller, and screen split makes you productive and the coding work easy."
1,"Good one. love the stand but the display quality is bad. first, there was a bad light leak problem but then, dead pixel and dead subpixel issues even after changing panel 4 times. still not resolved.also, They boosted the price to 30k and sold at 29k saying it’s an offer. But after I bought it. It became ₹28k. That’s the price of this product."
1,"Please see other brand monitors, performance wise I was not that happy on the amount spent. Also, this 4K UHD monitor 27UL550 stopped working. Raised a complaint with LG.1st technician came opened the monitor and took pictures of internal components, next day he arrived and said LCD panel replacement is disapproved and need to take videos of internal components again by re-opening. He forgot opening tool and started opening with hands and nails also asked for a knife to open which I denied. By the time it had abrasions from the sides due to opening. The service team are game players and I am facing wort experience from LG and their service. I don’t recommend this product anytime.Either spend some more money and buy a reliable product which does not fail."
4,"Pros:Excellent Panel.Accurate and vibrant colors.Can get really bright.Good Black levels.The stand provided is really nice.Cons:Wobbles a bit if the surface shakes.Price is slightly on the higher side for the the features.One would atleast expect a USB C at this price point bit it doesn't have one. It's available in UL850 which is 10k more than this model.Irrespective of what the description shows, it DOESN NOT have a USC C port. I was aware of it before buying but the images are a bit misleading."
5,"I am being honest in what i write here.... there really isn’t, literally, anything else in the market like this monitor at this price if you really have the need for it. Ultra gaming is a given but need for content creation is also way above average. This product from LG really is a masterpiece for this price. I love it entirely."
5,"a nice monitor, good colors, hdr works when connected to macbook 16inch, no visible back light bleeds. overall happy with the purchase."
5,Not a gamer. Mainly for work from home office work. Connected to HP laptop. Very simple installation. Texts are clear in documents and no distortions. Color looks pretty. The up/down movement is really useful to get the height right. Just push monitor up or down to adjust height.  Not a bezel less but looks good.
1,A huge and intense Backlight bleeding on the corner that is even visible when doing some task on screen...and degrade the viewing experience......please note we are spending 30k just for display
3,first package came with all 4 side ips bleed...no not ips glow... bleed.. i was so disappointed of it.. then amazon replaced with the new... which is still have ips bleed on the left bottom.. but iam okay with it .. it is not much noticable but.. make sure you check for ips bleed when you order.. dont get confused with ips bleed and ips glow.. ips glow is normal in ips displays.. bleed is something manufacture fault.. you can google if you have doubt just like i did.. when you pay 30k should get neat product .. unless you spend your parents money..
5,It's a good 4k monitor for the price. HDR is there just for the records but couldn't expect more for the given price range. Overall it's a great monitor for 4k video editing and movie watching. Currently using it with Dell XPS 15.
5,"I really love the monitor. It is best one you can get with incredible features like 4k, vesa mount, adjustable stand, 27inch.Only problem is that it doesn't have usb c. There is another model which comes with it but it is 10k more and i feel not worth it. I right now use usb to hdmi convertor with my laptop."
1,Not happy... Had to get the screen replaced just after one week of getting it due to ghosting issue and even the second screen has the same problem waiting for serving replacement. Pretty sure I was sent a refurbished item for the price of brand new.
5,"It’s a good monitor from LG. 4K resolution with 27 inch size is a good combination to go for. The text appears very clear, colours are also good while using with Mac OS. Thankfully, there is no backlight bleeding in the monitor I received but it has typical IPS glow.Few cons: HDR does not seem to be working as expected with Mac. Packaging and built quality of the panel could be better. In this price LG could give slimmer bezels.Overall good monitor for productivity and multitasking during work from home. I got it for 27K in sale so it’s ok."
4,"I was looking for monitor with following requirements1. 4k2. IPS panel3. @ 25k INRAnd I found this monitor is exact match. We get best panel in this monitor, because LG is known for developing IPS panel monitors.I don't play games that much, So i am not sure about gaming performance. If you are planning to buy for multitasking in software development or if you are designer who is looking for color accuracy then go ahead.Cons:1. You need to buy type C to display port cable. If you are going to use this with macbook.2. Colors accuracy is not as same as macbook but you will get decent accuracy. ( budget wise it is ok)"
1,"White Spot on Display, Used product sent to me. There was already 1 hr or up time on the monitor."
4,"This monitor has an issue with HDR mode on my Macbook Pro 16 running Catalina when using a usb-c to hdmi cable with convertor built in. But it works great in HDR mode under windows with my Dell Latitude when using the same cable.The screen can be pivoted to vertical mode and the brightness is very good. I would recommend this if you are looking for a 27"" 4k monitor. On windows use with display scaling set to between 120%-150% At native resolution, the text is too small for most people.The colour accuracy of this monitor is fairly good in its factory default state when compared to my Macbook Pro 16's built in display using images displayd on a web browser. This is after adjusting the 2 screens to have visually similar levels of brigtness. The 2 look fairly similar, although not identical. I havent calibrated the displays or done critical photo editing. The viewing angles of this panel are inferior to that of the Mac's built in display.This monitor is great for stock trading, coding and web browsing. When used at its native resolution, you can have a lot of stock charts or code windows displayed on the screen. Even with 150% display scaling (2560x1440 equavalent resolution on a Mac) you can easily have 2 or 4 web browser pages displayed at a time w/o any of them going into mobile mode.I havent noticed any dead pixels in the 1 week since I got this monitor."
4,Very good 4k monitor but Hdr is useless.. I have connected to Macbook Pro 16 inch the colors are washed out..But everything else expect for Hdr is just perfect... 👌👌👌
5,Using it for my Macbook Pro and the picture quality is too good.Need to buy separate 4k 60hz cable for a better output.The hydraulic stand mount is excellent and very adjustable.Single switch below the screen for settings and power.
1,"The display stopped working after a week of usage. Played games, used it for editing and watched movies. Then. It just stopped."
2,"This Monitor have heating issue and the front part of monitor heated, not too much but yup it heats after use 1 hr. You feel kinda blurness  in it.  Fadeed color. I feels like my eye got some problem but it is in this monitor you feel  .Its not for content creater or watching movie as well. I planed to return this and take my money back."
5,Excellent gaming monitor. Very bright for a TN panel. HDR support is excellentBest size for ppl confused between 24inch or 27 inch monitor.I recommend for gamers. Height adjust at this price is a steal Stand is sturdy and solidComes with only HDMI cable. U will have to buy DP cable if u need. HDMI supports 144hz so no need to worry.I'm happy with the product.
5,Quick Delivery. Nicely Packed.Easy Assembly.Great Picture Quality considering its a TN panel and a really bright panel. Hdmi cable included. Using it on144 hz no issues so far to use gsycn you have to use DP which is not included. Stand is really sturdy and panel doesn't wobble. People complaining about dull colours need to get their eyes checked.I wish it was a 2k panel coz you can see pixels if you sit close to the monitor.
5,"I was looking at many other IPS panel but stumbled upon this one unexpectedly. The things that worked out for me were:1.) Bright Panel 350 nits2.) Newer Model3.) 165 hz, Added Benefit4.) IPS PanelIt's just been few days since I've got this and out of the box, the colors looked a bit washed out but, little bit of fiddling with the OSD did the trick. Now it's perfect.Do note one thing that the mount does not support portrait mode.Overall, Solid 9/10 from me. I haven't owned any other IPS panels, apart from my laptops inbuilt display which is IPS and 144hz so im quite satisfied with this display."
5,"Ive been using this for a long time now.. I know lenovo since i have its legion series and their customer service is great. I am an FPS player and love to edit videos along with making music. It is also great for office work.Pros -1. Great colours2. Large display3. Brightness is great4. You can get 144hz with the HDMI cable it comes with. The quality is great5. Small bezels that make it look beautiful.Cons -1. No speaker, but you can add in a bluetooth speaker so that is not an issue for me2. Brightness can be too much for some people.. not for me personally.Final Verdict.. GO FOR IT !!"
1,"This monitor works fine for a few weeks and the runs into all sorts of issues with the panel and the replacement that Lenovo sends has even further issues. From my current experience, it would be best to avoid Lenovo when it comes to displays as they clearly have some sort of a quality issue and their customer support is absolutely pathetic."
4,"Packaging of the product was good and there was no dead pixel. Bezels are very less on the 3 sides and it feels very sturdy to the touch.ProsGood Build Quality144Hz on HDMI and Low latency as promisedGood for fps titlesHeight Adjustable standConsBad color reproductionBad viewing angles (You have to sit directly in front of it otherwise it appears yellowish)No inbuilt speakerIf are getting this on sale and you are ok with a TN Panel then just go for it, otherwise Acer and MSI provide some good quality IPS panel for some extra bucks."
5,"Picture Quality is amazing even tho it is a TN panel. it is a really high quality TN panel with great viewing angles,My unit arrived with no dead pixels and worked great even after long sessions and there was little too non artefacts,HDR is really good and I haven’t been able to try G-sync yet because I don’t have a DP cable (G-Sync only works through display port for those who didn’t know)Overall i am really happy with the quality and even the stand although is plastic is very sturdy and of good quality 10/10 would recommend (i bought this for 14,499/- on sale for those who wanted to compare price to performance)Thank you"
5,"It does everything as promised. One of the lowest costing monitors with G-sync. However, picture quality (read sharpness) is a concern. I would recommend if you're a hardcore nvidia gamer only with a budget in mind.Side note: gaming is a breeze on it though. Don't worry, your games will look great, even though for a screen this big, 1080p isn't enough imo. Don't buy this if you're a graphics designer or work with photos a fair bit."
5,"The picture quality is decent for a TN Panel. Didn't experience any ghosting, corona or artifacts at higher overdrive levels. The stand is pretty sturdy. Though the display claims to support HDR, I wasn't able to get it to work.The HDMI cable it comes with is a high speed one."
5,Go for it
5,Very nice Lennovo Monitor.
5,1) backlight bleeding is very less compared to Acer monitor of my friend.2) Freesync worked great with HDMI (bought seperately).3)1ms MSRT wont work with freesync and it reduces brightness.4) no application to control all these settings.5) go to lenovo site and type serial number to check warranty.6) very narrow 3 sides bezelsmy personal recommendation for valorant/csgo users to go to settings and select fps level 1 or 2. made valorant color better.
5,I got this monitor on flipkart at 9.5kit is very good value for money if you get it under 10000.
3,Screen Quality is not that much rich as expected . M not satisfied .
5,Best of all gaming monitors
1,"well the monitor was superb, great color awesome black details, good contrast, sleek design, subtle curve and pretty much good for gaming and multimedia usage, but things turned upside down on 3rd day of my usage, half of the screen is dead..as u can see it in the attachment something has gone on the left half of the screen, and it just happened while i was using the monitor, tried restarting + using different hdmi cable+ using different ports etc but nothing really changed, so basically the monitor died within 3 days of usage,I have returned the product now and will buy the same monitor again due to the quality of the picture but dont know how the reliability will be.. i will update it here"
1,Dead pixel appearing just after 1 month. Can't get it replaced now. The customer care knows nothing. The hilarious part is they told me to contact HP for there monitor XD.RIP 15K. Should've stayed away from Samsung in the first place.
5,"This is my first 144 Hz monitor, upgrade from Sumsung 24"" normal curved monitor. For gaming it is awesome. Also good for video playback and daily tasking.Picture quality realy  very good. Good black  level (after adjust)."
5,It's my first 144mhz purchase so m happy
5,"The picture quality is way better than what i was expecting from a VA panel. Colours are vibrant. Blacks are dark. Even white is white (after calibration, green value tends to be high in default setting). It is sitting right next to my IPS display that i have used for years and had several calibration for acurate colours. I mainly use that for editing photos and videos and colour correction of photographs. This display is matching a lot with that. Though viewing angle is not that great when compared. You have to sit straight in front for maximum accuracy. For gaming in this budget its a great steal."
1,"Dead pixels!!!!!!!!!Got on prima day deal for 14k. Thanks to appario seller and amazon for this deal. Even offline price was 15-16k so this was an amazing deal for a FHD 144hz VA monitor( been 1 month since purchase no issues)1. Packaging: Amazon box was damaged and lil bit even the Samsung box was damaged for some reason. Was a lil apphrensive but luckily thermacol packing was proper, no damage/scratches on monitor2. Display: No dead pixels found , all pixels are even brightness. No flickering , stuttering issues present3. Video Quality: Color reproduction is thousand times better than TN panel. Need to adjust setting for best color as stock setting looks washed out. For time being using the cinema mode but can be optimised further4. Backlight Bleed is there and is unavoidable given the price and the VA panel and is not that noticable if viewing angle is dead straight. Title the monitor and find the proper angle to reduce bleed5. Ghosting: ghosting is noticeable sadly but I'm not sure if it's due to laptop. Dont think it's a deal breaker for me6. Looks the Matt finish is very nice which makes the bezel not noticeable also screen is not very reflective7. There is option to have vesa mount as stand given is very short and not adjustable.8. Display port cable not given which is not good. There is HDMI cable given***Make sure to set the display settings of windows to 144hz. All this long it was set to 60hz🤐The hdmi cable will support upto 120hz use a DP cable for full 144hzFor gaming set the response time to fastest to eliminate ghosting in osdBest monitor settings in my opinions:Brightness:55-60Contrast:80Sharpness:60Color: R:50 G:50 B:60 Gamma mode 3I will update this review once I get my hands on my gaming pc and check the performance then(waiting for rtx 3060/3070) will also test for freesync"
5,"If you’re a 60hz monitor user and want to upgrade it. This is the screen you need.My gameplay drastically change. No wonder why i was not getting enough kills with my old monitor.About the quality of this monitor, I must say it’s great. If this monitor sell for 20k then it would still worth it - and I bought it for only 12.6k. Really happy with the purchase.I was little afraid before placing order because of negative reviews about getting damage product, stop working after 2-3 weeks and all.But then again - Not all units would same.About negative side of this monitor for me is that high brightness on 0. I wish I can reduce the brightness of this monitor more.About the look, you will be impressed I’m pretty sure. It looks so clean and expensive thing.I’m really enjoying games with this monitor. You can clearly go for it. Normal price of this monitor is 16k something but it’s still worth it.You will not regret 👍🏻"
5,Awesome performance.. Very less bleed.. Go for it!
4,"Good monitor. Having vga port, hdmi port, display port, headphone jack to output audio. 144hz is really smooth even for office work as scrolling the documents like pdf, word etc is really smooth. It is flicker free and I have checked with slomo from my phone (960fps). Eye care mode works but with almost full brightness😑 you can't change brightness when eye care mode is activated. I feel  brightness is too much if you are working for long hours. Overall good monitor"
5,I dont have words to say. Op product for hardcore gaming😏😏😏😏😏😍😍😍😍😍
5,"This is a good budget gaming monitor,I had owned two TV's and a LG monitor and I was looking for a budget monitor for my bedroom table to use pc and PS4.Since I was pensive about buying a monitor, this served the purpose and I am able to see differences in FPS games and sharp resolution, thanks to the fast refresh rate.Tested games from PS4, Xbox series s, and PC.. the resolution 1080p and screen size of 24 inch was perfect since my room space is small.The curved screen is a treat."
5,"Everything is good about this monitor. Display is crisp and bright, the stand sturdy and occupies little space and the monitor frame feels strong and not flimsy. It's light weight too. They even provided a cable for display port. Would have been great if they could have provided a cable for the HDMI"
1,It's like samsung is giving quality discarded panels but what else can be expected in this price range. Wanna go 144hz va go with msi ir maybe try same monitor's higher end varient with qled panel.Got it for 13k.Mine had visible color variance while on grey background
5,(the monitor on left)price:-I got this product for 13200 on amazon during sale .This montior is value for money at this price range.color:-the colour of monitor is good and by twaking settings a little bit you can get your desired colour from this monitor .
5,"THIS IS MY FIRST GAMING MONITOR AND I JUST LOVE IT. THIS BEAST IS A COMPLETE MULTITASKER WHETHER ITS READING, WATCHING MOVIES OR PLAYING GAMES, IT JUST AMAZES YOU EVERYTIME. GOT IT FOR 13,199 INR.GO FOR IT."
4,Good for gaming. Although picture quality is not the best in class. No option to adjust height or tilt is the only major downside.
5,"If You looking For a Budget Monitor You Can Go with Samsung Curve Monotor , This is my First Curve Display , It’s amazing experience with it , Loved it so much"
5,Good Product and panel quality.
4,This is my first curved monitor and Samsung didn't disappoint. Monitory is really good and I really liked it. It is easy to assemble.
4,Packaging and product is superb but idk how a black dot appears on the left top corner
5,Monitor is awesome but I didn't get Display port cable.I have got hdmi with the box.
1,"I am getting flickering screen and unwanted white lines while playing AC odyssey at ultra settings using default HDMI cable. While playing, bottom of the screen are not generating clear image."
5,I’m thankful that it arrived in perfect condition. The display is awesome once you see it. It feels good and is really the worthiest monitor under ₹15K
5,Good product and value for money... Good Deal and really good for online gaming interface.
5,Very good product ..If height adjustment will provided with this it will be awesome but better value.. I am using it for gaming and it feels good. Must buy for gaming..
5,Best gaming monitor for beginners and low budget gamers you can take it without any problem
5,Good for work from home setup
5,Good as expected.
5,"Ultra smooth display ..! Perfect for gaming hence it goes 13,200 on sales that is the perfect value for money for this product !!"
5,Value for moneyGreat pic qualityOfficial work / movies
1,Heard it's a good monitor but got a defective unit on 30th May 2020 which has display panel issue. Need replacement...
4,It's really good in this cost. Great colour texture and good for gaming. Thank you Amazon for delivering it safe.
1,"I ordered this on 16 Oct and received it on 21 Oct for Karnataka, Kudos for Amazon for fast delivery.I was very excited as I had never experienced a 144hz display.I opened the package and quickly configured it only to realize there is no Display port cable and there is only 1 Hdmi cable.Then as soon as display came on I was wishing there should be no dead pixel or screen bleeding. Instead, I got this faulty display that was improperly packaged and had bushed patch pattern all over the left side. I tried to change the HDMI port but the result was the same.Now the price has gone up again sale time have ended and I can't buy it again for 20k instead of 15750 for which I bought it for.Really disappointed with MSI quality check.The overall monitor is better than all other TN panel monitor in term of colour but it can't match the original IPS colours.So choose wisely!Thanks for the read!"
5,"It is well built. Is IPS, 144hz and 24 inch. Also has fast response time. IPS is a must in today's world and the improvement in video quality is amazing for watching movies and playing games. An Acer monitor offers almost similar quality for cheaper but is almost always out of stock and lots of people complain of manufacturing defects.  I use the following settings:Night vision = offResponse time = fastAnti motion blur = offPro mode = userHDCR = OFFImage enhancement = offBrightness = 100Contrast = 55Sharpness = 0Color temperature = custom r, g, b = 100/100/100"
5,"I got this monitor for my Lockdown Setup.This is my first MSI Product and i'm very happy to have selected this choice.Monitor comes with Stand and HDMI Cable, It's very easy to assemble the monitor and the stand is very sturdy on my desk.The monitor is plug & play on my computer, I downloaded additional drivers from MSI website for more tweaking.The selection button on the backside of the monitor is really nice, it is sturdy and makes choosing options very easy. I'm currently gaming at 144Hz on my computer & 60Hz on my PS4. There are amazing presents for different types of gaming such as FPS, RGP, RTS etc. When not gaming there are other presents such as Movie, Designer & Reader profiles which are on point for their usage. If you still want to tweak colors on your monitor there are various websites which provide manual tweaking numbers (which I feel is not needed).The size is perfect for my viewing pleasure, I certainly do not want a larger size than this for gaming and wouldn't mind investing in a second MSI Monitor as well."
4,"I am writing after 1 month of use.1. Display- great 1080p display. Colors are very saturated and you will enjoy media consumption like watching movies, reading comics of pdf books. Blacks are very black with slight backlight bleeding; not like super AMOLED but grat. Good for video editing and content creation for youtube but not 100% accurate. If you are a professional photographer or movie maker look for high-end displays.  . Brightness is very high, you have to reduce its brightness to 20 to 25%. Webpage and text look very sharp and crisp.But it's a 1080p display. If you sit too close to the display you can see the pixels and it may cause the screen to look less vibrant. So either you sit a few inches away or look for a UHD 4K display. But you have to pay 3 times more.2. Build quality- It's very good looks premium as the screen to body ratio is more.  It's sturdy and does not wobble at all. But it's a plastic body, not metal. Metal would have cost you more. metal stand and the base is very heavy and premium.3. Gaming- gaming is very good, but nothing extraordinary like premium gaming monitors. But for average gamers, I will get the job done more than perfectly.  Less eye fatigue, good visibility in a low light condition, sharp display, less choppy framerates are some of them. But do not expect anything very big. while gaming.4. Higher refresh rate. You will enjoy it the most. It moves like butter, both your computer experience and gaming experience will be improved significantly. But while gaming, make sure you have a high-end GPU to hit the desired framerates. Also, buy DP cabal separately to improve frame rates.5. Cabal- It's a 2 pin adapter with good quality cabal long enough to reach a distant power source.SO I WOULD SAY ITS A FULL VALUE FOR MONEY. BEST AT THIS PRICE RANGE.NOW A BIG PROBLEMSOME OF THEM HAVE FAULTY DISPLAY.-As I started the monitor I noticed one dead pixel at the left upper corner. I gently massaged over it and it got fixed and started working normally. It made me panic and I was closely monitoring all individual pixels on the display to check.  I discovered one faulty single pixel in the middle of the display. The faulty pixel has one fixed purple color. One very small dark purple spot. It made me upset as I can not get it out of my mind and can be seen in a white display. It's really they have some faulty displays. Although it's not a big groundbreaking thing to have one faulty pixel and you may barely notice it unless I show you with your eyes very close to the monitor, but as I have seen it I can hardly ignore it. I waited for 14 days return period to watch if the fault gets aggravated. As nothing happened, I stay with my product. Did not return. What if I get more faulty display next time!If you buy this and see big faults in the pixels, change it immediately. I have 14 days time period. Or you may be totally lucky and would get a perfectly working display. Some displays have backlight bleeding issues but mine is perfect producing deep black.So my final verdict is GO FOR IT WITH YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. AND IF YOU WANT MORE GO FOR UHD 4K DISPLAY FROM LG, SAMSUNG OR DELL. BUT PREPARE TO PAY 3 TIMES MORE."
5,"I upgraded from a Samsung 75Hz monitor and was a bit skeptical about spending so much on a monitor.  But after using it I can more than justify the money I spent on it. 144Hz makes a world of difference from 60Hz, not just in gaming performance but also in general use. Everything looks so smooth. The wide color gamut of the monitor might raise some flags to some fearing oversaturation of colors but that is so not the case with this monitor. The colors a vibrant and pop, seeing the red of the YouTube logo has now become surprisingly pleasing. The blacks are good and there is little to no background bleed. The panel is more than bright enough for regular use.If I could nitpick about the monitor, the only thing I'd complain about is the viewing angles. Its vertical viewing angles aren't too great but they rarely affect general use cases. However, in a room with sunlight, the anti-glare coating on the monitor washes out its colors when viewed sideways at an angle.All in all this monitor is a worthy investment, with 0 regrets."
2,"Hi MSI Team,Please consider this as a suggestion from my side :Your SERVICE for the products is pathetic, I have been following with the Service Team for more than 2 months for simple replacement.Neither of the MSI Authorized personal phones is getting connected.Rather than spending millions in selling the products do consider and invest in YOUR SERVICE PART as well.I had a lot of impressions of MSI BUT NOW IT'S LONG GONE.YOU JUST LOST A CUSTOMER. And I will make sure to review the MSI SERVICE of what I have faced, the Internet will know.Thanks"
1,"Editing review after 2 months .. Reason is prev. I gave 4 star now I gave 1 star as I have been like troubleshooting "" Screen Tearing "" issue since 2 months 28-01-21 till date 12-3-21 .. today I sent it to Msi point for Warranty process as it has manufacturing fault, Was trying since 2 months tried dp/HDMI cables tried several other GPUs, tried LOW Latency settings for my RTX 2070 super but finally I came to know that there was some issue inside the monitor and I'm really QUESTIONING MSI QUALITY CHECK (QC) ™ that how on earth they can send Faulty Product to Retailer/Wholesalers it's nearly around 17k product really too bad , really too bad and I request AMAZON.IN ™ to produce some help as I did turns to mail to MSI SERVICE INDIA for replacement or Renew anyways beside screen tearing issue I'll rate this monitor as a "" AVERAGE / SATISFACTORY ""."
1,At 144Hz the display starts flickering every 20-25min. There is some serious quality issue with MSI. Luckily I had my return window open so i got the refund. Guys to be honest I wouldn’t suggest you to go for this brand as the display quality isnt upto the mark. You never know when that blind flickering turns into a dark nightmare. If you’re investing on this one. Be ready to spare with the consequences if you’re unlucky.
4,"1. On the three sides it has really thin bezels. Joystick for menu navigation is smooth and it's UI is very simple and user friendly.2. Most important aspects ,i.e., back-light bleeding and ips glow are almost unnoticeable even in dark room. Colors are accurate. No dead pixels noticed yet.3. Although when I compared it with my laptop screen, white color looks dull as if it is off-white color (can be adjusted by changing color-temperature but then it feels like it is emitting too much blue light). Though other colors are vibrant.4. HDMI provided supports 144Hz out of the box...so no need to purchase DP cable.5. 250 nits brightness is too much. During daylight (with direct sunlight in my room) I use it with only 50% brightness and at night I reduce it to 0%(and it still looks brighter)(well suitable for working environment). For gaming purpose, 80% to 40% brightness is enough for day and night respectively.6. Make sure you register your product at MSI website. They are currently offering 2 games for free ( offer is valid till 31st Dec and you can redeem any one of the games). Games: 1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla (Standard Edition) 2. Watchdog Legion (Standard Edition).Edit: After almost a week, spotted one dead pixel :("
5,"Mighty impressed with this monitor, Bought it as part of desk setup for laptopThe colors and viewing angles are great (128% srgb gamut), Brightness is perfect for indoor use, design looks sleek and build is fine.The stand is sturdy, no wobbles. (There is no height adjustment or rotation, but you get what you pay for)Was able to configure refresh rate to 144hz using both included HDMI cable (connected to HDMI1) and display cable (amazon basics).Also supports GSync via display port. (need to enable free sync from settings first) perfect for gaming.No dead pixels and backlight bleed is very minimal in my case(expected from IPS panels) so not worth complaining about. Blacks look great on this.3.5mm head phone jack is handy and the stand can be used as a headphone holder as well.(Wish it had atleast 2 usb ports too)"
5,"the initial impressions for the product is great the setup was not too complicated eitherthe color is good along with the brightnessfree sync and 144hz seems to work together with hdmi , don't know if its a bug or notthe osd controls are easy to quickly adjust the settings of the monitor for different usesno backlight bleeding that is visible or dead pixels on the monitor eitheroverall go for it , I was considering buying acer but this was almost the same price as the 165 hz model but I had an MSI laptop that lasted a pretty long time with no problem."
5,"Perfect packaging and one day delivery!Great monitor to play FPS like CS, Valorant, Apex etc. Remember this monitor comes with HDMI cable , no DP cable and thats a bummer. With HDMI the refresh rate is 120hz out of the box not 144hz, so you need to download MSI display kit and use it to enable 144hz on HDMI. Or the best you can do is buy a display port cable and you're done, 144hz default."
5,"well tbh, best monitor for price range 16-18k, i got lucky got it for 15.2k *AGIF*_you can get this monitor offline around 16.5-17.2kCan't really click good pictures from my OP5T but here it goes_No dead pixel, No Bleeding!!_I'm getting 144hz with hdmi, GPU 1660 super. _Didn't buy DP for g sync yet, still it feels so smooth/crisp(B 50 C 55)Last monitor lenovo, good upgrade I'd say. #goforit"
2,monitor build quality is good but lcd panel is worsti found 4 dead pixels then I ask for replacement on Amazon customer serviceand amazon customer services are friendly and they immediately approved me for the replacementafter got replacement i have got same dead pixel issuethis was my msi first and last producti allways never disappointed by Asusi trusted that msi also a very good brand but msi product quality isn't upto marki m very disappointed and i will never purchase expensive thing made by msi
5,After a good amount of research i bought this for 2 reasons1. I wanted good sRGB it has 128%And good DCI p3 it has 95%2. 144hz Gsync compatible (with DP cable)None of the monitor in this range has these two features together.
5,"It is my First MSI product, and I can say that it's worth Spending 14-15K on this monitor.I have been using it for more than 2 Weeks. I earlier ordered Samsung monitor to Work from Home purpose and to play games sometimes (75Hz Monitor), that monitor was good but was hurting my eyes badly as I am sitting <1meter from the screen. There were 2 dead pixels and also IPS glow was seen clearly from bottom. Somehow I was able to return back and got the refund.Next I ordered this monitor :Pro -1. Not hurting the eyes.2. Tilt Adjustment (really helpful than the fixed one)3. 144 Hz, fluid display4. Two HDMI ports and one DP port (can be used to connect multiple computers same time)5. It's a Gaming Monitor (Gaming is really good with Gaming mode - RPG, RACINGFPS...6. No IPS Glow for me (Even in night)7. Awesome build quality (better than the Samsung one)8. Less dust prone (i see little dust attracted to this)Cons:1. No height Adjustment2. Its a Freesync Monitor nor G-Sync(ITs not a con though)3. Fluctuating price in Amazon.Conclusion -If you are gamer, definitely its a awesome piece of work even will support for Video/ Photo editing ang WFH. Price : Buy when its approx. 15K"

5,"This is really great monitor for the price i think you should close your eyes and just buy it i had 60 Hz Monitor before and i bought this this is 144Hz its very good no cons even the factory issue (yellow tint is fixed ) its very good i have done dual monitor setup with this it looks greaTyou can check out my channel SimplyLegend ,Anyways its perfect from all angles ."
5,"I was sceptical about considering IPS panel over VA cos of backlight bleeding and darkness levels and uniformity because I usually work in a dark room. However I saw that every single VA panel under 20k has an issue one way or another. Most of them that are curved have big blotches of backlight bleeding, so I went for this as it had good reviewsHowever I was suprised with the darkness levels and uniformity actually.The only con I found was that the lowest brightness is not very low, but Ive overcome it by tweaking some contrast & backlight settings"
5,"This is relative all to the price: Perfect is perfect, negligible bleed. Sturdy construction. Included cables for everything. 144Hz works flawlessly. Menu options are good. VESA mount. Not very heavy. The charging brick is wierd and ungainly but that's how all of them are anyway.Would have liked a USB port to connect some peripherals but those usualy add to cost so it's fine. Just added a USB hub instead."
5,"Good monitor. Good sRGB gamut. None of the other monitors have at this price point.Coming to price - why amazon?MSI Optix G241V 23.8 Inch Esports Gaming Monitor - FHD (1920x1080), Flat, IPS Panel, 75Hz - AMD FreeSync has increased from  10,999.00 to  13,003.00"
5,"Always been a fan of MSI products and this is no exception, this is my first 144hz monitor and that too on an IPS panel with gsync it couldn't get any better than this. I Was using a 60hz panel before with a Nvidia RTX 2070 super so I was clearly bottlenecking my system with my monitor and if you are in the same situation I suggest you to buy a 144hz and trust me it makes a whole world of difference and you won't look back. Colours are so vibrant and accurate and the response time with gsync enabled feels so smoothCons:- no major con but it would've been better if they gave dp cable because it's necessary if you want to enable gsync on this monitor and 144hz refresh as hdmi cable only supports 120hz, the minimum brightness is to bright for my liking and the last con would be no height adjustment of the monitor if it did have the height adjustment feature this would've been on par with it's benq counter part but it still it offers so much for so less.Verdict:- Great fricking monitor and I am very satisfied with my purchase, 5 star all around"
4,Overall fantastic monitor for the price and contains all the features as promised.Sadly it seems to be really delicate. The plastic bits creak when touched or grabbed. Feels like it'll break off if I even look at it. I accidentally hit the screen with a few objects which ended up leaving marks. Yes it's my fault but all the monitors I've had previously never had this problem. I suppose the material used for the screen is too delicate. If you don't mind that and aren't as careless as me bonking stuff around then it's okay. I'm not sure if you can find better built or stronger monitors at this price range.
1,Amazon prime video very good colors and clear video but there is too much ips glow not on one corner but on all 4 corners and very distracting i have returned it for gaming its very  good though
1,Received damaged product. There's enough backlight bleed to annoy you and yeah deal pixel too. Idk what is up with Amazon. They always sell cheap faulty products whenever on discount. Monitor is just perfect if you can get one without any issues.
5,Its actually a pretty great monitor for the price literally nothing comes close in out market and its also great this this monitor is supported on the ps5 120hz mode picture quality is greatthe response time is amazing it's just a good monitor all around.. One thing... The hdmi cable was not very long but that is a minor nitpik also the led on the power button might take some getting used to if you play in the dark. If you want a monitor for your ps5 this is definitely the one.
4,"I am very impressed with this monitor after the past few months of use. If you want to dip into high refresh gaming on a budget, the combination of price, 1080p resolution that is easy to run and picture quality make it an easy recommend.Build quality is good for the price, with a decent base and stand that feels solid and well constructed, though there are very few options for adjustment with it only having tilt, but no pan or height adjust available. The bezels are fairly thin but nothing to write home about, and even though it's a plastic housing it feels well constructed. The control button on the back is also well built and navigating the menus is intuitive and easy. Having it hidden away is an extra bonus. The screen has a matte finish so reflections are well controlled.There are a number of gaming features built into the monitor, though I never use them. I don't feel that boosting shadows or adding a cross-hairs to the center of the screen makes my gaming experience any more enjoyable.Picture quality and performance is good considering the price. After some calibration out of the box you can get decently balanced colour rendition and good performance in the shadows and highlights. Shadow performance is decent, though dark areas can appear somewhat washed out. Highlight roll-off is ok, though there are some details lost in very bright scenes. Colour balance leaves something do be desired. Blue and green levels are well maintained though reds are over saturated and blown out. Brightness is good, and I used the monitor in a well lit room without issue, though my only gripe is that the monitor doesn't turn down the brightness enough, with even the lowest setting being very bright for use at night or in dark rooms. Viewing angles are good, though quality does dip. High refresh performance is ok. Using a computer at 144hz is very enjoyable with animations and movement feeling very smooth, though there is ghosting and artifacting, especially around text and the mouse pointer but you can't expect much better than this for the price.At this price, I can recommend the MSI Optix G241 for 1080p gaming or daily use. It has some image quality issues but you would have to spend a considerable amount more for high refresh gaming without ghosting or artifacting.For those interested, here are my calibration settings though your results may vary:Brightness: 0 (or as low as you can have it depending on your room)Contrast: 70Sharpness: 0Colour Temperature: R44 G53 B52"
5,"I am happy with my purchase, quick delivey with nice packaging, as expected from Amazon.About MSI again expected great quality of product.The features are great in this model and the joystick button at the back of the monitor is fun to use.Althoug, I have one single dead pixel in the top middle of the screen but I did not find it a major problem so did not went through the process of replacement. Maybe it is because of the position of the dead pixel coming towards the address bar of the web browser.There is little manoeuvre on left to right but larger top to bottom, this sometimes gets tricky to balance if I change my usual sitting position. But again, not a major problem for me.Overall, I will recommend this one for usual office use plus gaming use."
4,"This item, I received, is having dead pixels. Tried several times, But Amazon customer care executives played with me. Fade up with their game of cheating, I remained silent with that damaged product. One should never purchase this item from Amazon.  I am very very dishartened about this purchase."
5,"The first unit I ordered had a dead pixel and background bleed at a very small spot. Got it replaced. The replacement unit doesn’t have any dead pixels or background bleed issues. Coming from a 7 years old TN panel, the picture quality of this monitor is really good. The Colors are vibrant. As far as the gaming performance is concerned, the screen response time is not 1ms for sure as its MPRT and not GTG. You won’t be able to overclock the refresh rate on this one, if you are thinking 144hz to 165hz. Overall it’s good and you can go for it."
5,The MSI Optix G241 is definitely the best monitor in this price range especially if you want a high refresh rate monitor that not only is for gaming but also for media consumption and graphic editing.The panel is IPS and not VA like in most other high refresh monitor out there and it produces crisp mage quality which is really helpful as I use it for watching movie and even Photoshop where color accuracy is very important.Solid build quality and thin bezel makes it looks great and in sync with my setup which is a plus.Pros -IPS PanelSolid build qualityThin BezelGreat pricingCons -None as such
5,"Budget gamers looking for a decent 1080p gaming monitor should try this one. I've been using the 24"" monitor for more than a month and I am in love with the picture quality. Picked it for ~16500 INR and it has great features on an IPS panel, upgrading from 60hz is an amazing experience. No bleeding issue and no yellow tint complaint as reported by others. Note hdmi supports upto 120hz and DP can push it to 144hz. The control menu is simple and easy to use.  I did not find the reading mode very usefull but play around with setting and customise it for your taste. I am using this monitor as a primary display for work and gaming. It's easy to switch inputs, I am very happy buying this.Note, DP cable not included.MSI focused completely on the picture quality and features but the build quality is not that great. Some of the plastic components are cheap. So setup ur monitor and don't move it around carelessly. The control stick at the rear feels frail but don't worry use it gently :)No further complaints, go for it. Ekdam Mastt hai yaar !!"
4,"Pros:Easy to assemble. one of the best monitor with in 15K, Like three-sided ultrathin bezel design, 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution, AMD FreeSync technology, TÜV-certified etc.I have purchase this for office work like coding and debugging not for gaming. really happy with the performance.Cons:Power socket is 16A, need to purchase an extra converter.No Hight adjustable"
3,Monitor is good but power plug is very big and it won’t fit in normal and they have not mentioned this
5,A very good monitor for development. Im a developer and I used to code 8hrs per day and this monitor given so much of flexibility to my work. Movie quality is awesome.
5,"Worthy,  an absolutely amazing product. But the packaging was horrible. The box was torn from sides. There was no bubble wrap as well. Work on your packaging."
3,"Dell display manager driver works perfectly and help me to control brightness, contrast and other display features.  Good display for normal use. Purchase 6A power cable."
1,"The display is worst I should say. The product is not returnable, only replacement is allowed. Replaced product is also the same. Worst picture quality, you can't even read the text clearly. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. HIGH RISK ALERT"
5,"Picture quality is Very good and tilt adjustment stand, without specker"
5,Good product with large screen. Running smoothly. Picture quality is awesome and value for money. Slim design and overall I'm satisfied with the product till now. It's coming with 16A power socket so make sure you have the port.
4,Bigger and very good screen. Pricey. Cud go for one with speakers instead this one. Cant exchange only replacement. So make sure u need big screen. Used for office work but should be good for gaming.
5,Nice product! Easy to install... already 3 months using the screen and no issue at all.
1,I bought the monitor last month and within a month I’m getting a line on the screen. It’s really disappointing.
4,I got it under 14k it's an awesome monitor - only difficulties I faced are changing modes using the buttons everytime not very user friendly and then there is no speaker that's it
5,Good working device . Dell products always perfoms good .
4,"Like- 2 HDMI Port,Dislike- No USB port, not remote"
5,Best monitor  this segment but but delivery slow
1,They gave a power cord with an adapter and the plug is too big not fit in regular plugs. Display quality is not good. It looks very thick compare to other IPS panel displays.
5,Packaging was not properRest all good
1,"Dell is not a good brand for monitors, would not recommend to buy."
5,Excellent
5,All are good . But no vga port.
5,Superb
5,Outstanding
4,Monitor screen is excellent just the plug is very big and doesn't get inserted into a normal socket. You need to get a big socket for this.
5,Picture quality is great and bezeless is awesome 😎
5,Pros : Value for your money just plug in and play.Cons : worst packing quality ever!
3,"Over all it is good, but internal speakers are not working and i received an already opened package"
4,"Firstly, full marks for the monitor for its quality and working as per the technical specs.  However, the package arrived with its carton damaged. Fortunately it did not damage the monitor inside.  Second the packer had sent two power chords - one with 15 AMP Indian plug for a system that consumes 30 Watts power. The second power chord had an American plug.  Neither could be used in my work area that has 5 AMP Indian sockets mainly.  With an Indian-to-American plug adapter I got the system working.  I got the Monitor Driver downloaded from the ViewSonci site that was a zip file.  I could extract and install the display driver smoothly.  The monitor is now working very well with the QHD resolution of 2560X1440.  Any help on finetuning the display settings is welcome."
4,"Backlight bleed: Present  at 10 hr-10min clock location. but not noticeable,  ignored.Electric cables received: One of 16 A & other US type; Made in China.Display cable received: HDMI. Got 2k@60hz with Intel iris.Good anti glare.Viewing angles : Confirming  IPS.On/Off light: not front facing."
1,"This monitor need 16AMP socket. This is crazy specification, not sure why Samsung gives 16AMP plug  got a device that hardly consumes 50watt. Avoid buying this monitor."
1,"This monitor need 16AMP socket. This is crazy specification, not sure why Samsung gives 16AMP plug  got a device that hardly consumes 50watt. Avoid buying this monitor."
4,"Review Based On One Week Usage:- The product looks visually appealing.- The controls are bit clumsy (a single button/knob) to control like a trackpad for all settings.- The audio is not bad.- The biggest problem is that the color depth seems to be missing. You always feel as if there is a white light reflecting on the screen. The images in 4K lack the color depth and no matter how much contrast/brightness you adjust, you always get a glare in your eyes. I use the second 4K monitor alongside but that doesn't have any such glare and the colors are soothing to the eyes and are more appealing.- Everything looks to have a hue of white/green/yellow on this screen. I have already tried color temperature settings."
5,"Received the product as described, it's well made and sturdy. I installed it on a Godrej desk and it fit perfectly. I was able to mount my 27"" and 24"" monitors quite effortlessly. It said in the installation manual that the max weight per monitor should not be more than 7 kg, I was apprehensive if my 27"" monitor is heavier than that, but on measuring it was only 5 kg after removing the desk mount stand.The 24"" Samsung monitor I was able to mount with the included screws and washers, but the 27"" Crossover 27QW needed raisers as the screws were bit long. Luckily I had couple of raisers which came with another TV mount.Overall, a well made decently priced dual monitor mount."
4,"Good product. Sturdy. Packaging was good and contained all parts and instructions.The only Con - the rod on which the monitors fit, should have been longer by 2 inches to ensure that the monitors can come to the eye level, which is ergonomically better."
3,Overall okay product. Received damaged package with all parts intact. With this product desk looks cleaner and have more space to use.Pros:- Strong and sturdy build- Easy to setup- Flexible arms helps easy positioningCons:- Height is less- No option to extend the height- it is time consuming and difficult to change height.- Not much tilting support
5,i love this is product
5,Perfect packaging with perfect product. It does whatever is promised.
3,The rod length is small.. almost smaller than the original stand coming with monitor. The height of rod should have above 300mm or should have been 600mm.
5,Easy to assemble and use
5,Better than expected. All parts and screws required  included . Recommended
5,Very strong stand
5,Perfect product as per expectedLooking same as amazon pic
5,I liked this product. It was sturdy and well priced.
2,"The item was received incomplete, the connecting screws where missing. Thus could not assemble the product and initiated replacement."
5,Awesome product Best Quality thanks Amazon
5,Amazing
5,Good
4,"Overall, a well made decently priced dual monitor mount."
5,very nice for the price
5,Its good!
5,Awesome product
5,"1. Solid Construction2. excellent packaging3. Very durable considering the quality4. every screw and bit and washer is labelled exactly in separate pouches for easy and access.5. Height, reach, tilt and rotatable to 360 degree rotatable."
5,Did the job well!👍👍
5,bought this monitor and played csgo . I was Silver 4 yesterday and today I am a Master guardian 2. Amazing
1,Washed out coloursAwefull veiwong angles you need to be right infront of the screeen always.No significant improvement in gamingWorse the screen tends to go blank every now and then and inconveniently placed connectivity and power points.USB B connection point that is absolutely useless.Also comes with 16amp power plug unless you have a 16amp poower socket near ur desk please prepare to buy an adapter.You touch the screen to adjust the height it will go blank.It's a border line fraud
5,"So i am writing this review who are willing/confused about this monitorThe monitor is tn panelHdmi 2.0 supports 144hzPurchased this on great indian sale amazonU got 3hdmi port,1display portThe plug is little big so if your house have small plug points buy a adapter for the monitor plug (costs only 30rs)Its support xl share settings which is a great work done by benqI mostly play valorant,apex untill now the monitor hasnt dissapointed meI almost sit 7+ hours infront of the monitor (coding&gaming) till now no eye strains or headache"
5,Hands down the best 144hz Monitor for gaming
5,first i got a damaged one then i got replaced by a new one nice monitor oppppp....GG
5,❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,"Overall quality of the product is very good. Being VA panel, the picture quality is good"
5,this monitor is best
5,The best at fps games its simple yet comprehensive.
5,Tested 144Hz on PC.120Hz on PS5.
5,"Very sturdy stand, I have added my LG 34"" ultrawide down and dell 24"" monitor. Even the base metal is very strong and heavy. Brilliant built"
5,"Everything about this stand is excellent. Quality of workmanship and components, ease of installation, stability, smoothness of swivel joints etc. I am using two 24 inch monitors. This should work fine for 27"" displays too, though anything larger would be a tight fit."
5,"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I didn't want to drill holes on the wall, and wanted a solution which can sit on the table and hold 2 monitors sturdily. This does the job quiet well.Assembly instructions were clear, everything that's needed was included in the package (just make sure you have a star screw driver in hand), just have a little bit of patience, depending on how handy are with tools, it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.Overall, very satisfied with the purchase."
3,The whole quality of this Dual Monitor stand is good and sturdy. But the mechanism of holding the Monitors with the stand is not that great.It's absolutely my point of view.If anyone want to buy a Dual Monitor (Stack) Stand in a mid budget. Then go for it.
5,Sturdy. Value for Money. Super easy to set up. The box comes with all that you need to set up the display - all nuts and bolts. In my case it hosts a TV / 28 inch. I am using only 1 display but it is good for 2 displays. the centre pipe and the base are solid and the mounts are of metal.
5,The stand is sturdy and well built. Installation was very easy. Had small Query regarding installation and was quickly resolved by merchant. There are hooks provided for easy cable management. The center rod comes in two pieces. You can just attach one of them if you don't need two monitor installation.  Extremely happy with the purchase.
5,"Heavy duty stand on a affordable price range. looks good on table, I am using 2 29"" LG ultrawide monitor with this stand and looks very premium"
5,"Highly recommended for multitasking and increasing productivity. Strong, sturdy and value for money."
5,The product installation was easy after following the diagram supplied with. I am happy with it
5,"Solid build quality, easy installation, supports both 75mm and 100mm VESA mount, as described and highly recommended."
5,Its very good quality and study. can hold ultrawide monitors well. Way cheaper than other brands for 4.5k
5,Worth it
5,Go for it! Been 2 years no complaints!
5,Best
5,i need it again
5,"It's premium in every segment, being it packaging or assembling instructions. All required tools except screw driver comes with package."
2,"For this price... this product is ok ok...I ordered 3 monitors but among 3, 1 was damaged. Shows blue straight line on the screen... hence returned..."
4,Very good piece for the money ..  I am using for cc camera ..  Just now and then I make it on and c..  for this purpose I feel  15 inches is enough.  serving for this purpose nicely.
3,Lapcare LED monitor goodBut not inside VGA CableOnly monitor and stand with AC CardNo VGA Cable
5,"As mentioned in the headline, LAPCARE is the good one for the price.  I am happy to get this as it is very good for the purpose of screen I wanted.  This is good with innovation of switch buttons at the back.  It gives the appearance of high quality for the price we paid."
2,"not a gud monitor, the picture quality is worse  than i was expecting but still keeping as it wil b used for cctv only  , n the cable was defective too,"
5,My primary use for this is for my CCTV NVR system .Display is good enough for that. 👍🏻

5,Good product
5,OK this Monitor has model number KG241QS and there is similar monitor i mean exactly similar with model number KG241QP. Only the difference is that QS is a factory overclocked monitor.Here i will tell you everything about KG241QS which has 165hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time. the similar KG241QP has 144hz refresh rate and 1ms response time.I have owned IPS panel monitor from LG ( 22mp68vq ) and before this monitor i owned Asus (VG258QE) that was a TN panel Monitor. I recently bought this monitor to actually check whats the difference in 25000rs tn panel and 12000rs tn panel. and when i received this monitor i compared it with side to side with Asus monitor and the difference between two was literally 0%. And comparing this with ips monitor i.e is LG there was a very unnoticable color difference which you will never even notice except white looking a very little yellowish type. And by very little i really mean very little.I am just writing such big review for you guys to just tell you dont waste your money on pricier TN panels you wont notice even a bit of difference. I am loving this monitor gaming is heaven in this monitor so if you are planning to upgrade your monitor buy this use this n i can assure you that i will not be disappointed if you have used IPS panel before. if you want to invest your money invest it in either getting a 2k or get yourself a beast graphic card.I am here mentioning the perfect OSD setting for both 144hz and 165hz models you will get best colors out of it.Brightness - 55contrast  - 40black boost - 06gamma  - 2.4blue light  - offACM  - offSuper sharpness - offcolor temp  - normaloverdrive  - normalfreesync  - onVRB  - off
5,"Well i was holding my purchase for past 3 months for 144Hz monitor and finally pulled trigger on 5th March 2020.And i must say 60Hz users please get 144Hz if you can already .I am not gonna devide this into just pros and cons as it completely neglactes whole user experience i have so you have to read everything.First things first let's get the facts out of the way-1) It is 144 Hz and 165 Hz out of the box; whichever mode can be set with windows or Nvidia Control Panel.2) Enable AMD FreeSync from OSD then you can set Vsync then Gsync easily on both Hz without any issues.  (To enable Vsync is not necessary)So i don't think much is needed to say for gamer at least as this is purely meant for gaming. Colours are accurate out of the box. One can down Green slider from OSD a little bit(48) to make it more accurate otherwise it's fine. Even for movie,too. there are 4 modes in OSD and 3 for gaming.Lastpicture in my review has ACER 165 on left and BenQ VZ2350H on right. I don't have any complain on either one but look at the acer sometime just giving more vibrant and still warmer colours...this is personal preference and one might like BenQ one but i would go with Acer as it is easy on eyes. And moreover u can tweak this easily form RGB menu,2 gamma presets -1.8,2.2 and 2.4 and colour temperature setting but don't do it randomely...find a scale first to measure.I mainly play Rocket League and PUBG lite online and  I tried Witcher 3 offline. 165Hz always and no ghosting or trailing effect. Resident Evil and Tomb Raider players...sorry i can't test that deep. Your user experience may very from mine. The monitor works flawless for even 6-7 hours straight.No issues in reading text but it stil looks pixelated from 60 c.m. distance. But for images and movies it's just doing fine.Ok...so why get something better if u can? Because this is TN panel and it's gonna show it's symptoms from time to time. As i have to seat in level of the display. Watch slightly from more height or more low it will affect sky and white colours resulting in washed out colour and black shadow respectively. On normal windows usage this is a issue because there is a Green tint all over the place when u see it from angle. But but but here me out; you are not gonna watch form that angle and operate your pc...U can still watch a movie from that angle and it is just showing good expected colours.For gaming this is great value for 12499 INR as this justify every feature it comes with. One might wonder why i didn't talk about 0.5 ms response time but it's marketing gimmick anyway in every gaming monitor and one have to measure actual GTG response time and i don't have that tool. For me it's just fine on 144Hz and 165Hz.U can get Acer's 144hz IPS variant but for gaming this is just fine for 60Hz to 144Hz upgrade. Sorry if i left something u wanted to hear but i don't have any issue about black level or anything. Backlight bleed? I have picture attached and it's equal on whole panel but on camera it looks somewhat bad.In reality it's perfectly fine if u watch it from straight. Any other questions feel free to ask here. I will replay and test if i can."
4,"I was lucky to have got this for 11,915 INR. I knew AS SOON AS I order it, the price would go up.Now let's talk about the performance of this monitor. Coming from a 4K monitor, it took me a while to get used to the 1080p resolution of this monitor. The brightness is far too much for me. Even after I turned Brightness and Contrast to Zero, it was still far too bright for me. Other than that, I think it's a good deal at 11,915 INR."
5,"Literally the best monitor you can find for gaming at this budget, I've been using this for about 6 months now and I'm really impressed by the display and the colours. POG"
1,"PLease do not fall for the outside cover which claims normal refresh rate at 144hz and overclock 165hz. In reality, when checked from system, it shows 119hz and 137 as normal and overclock refresh respectively. Absolutely shameful marketing from acer and being sold by amazon."
5,I purchased this monitor Rs 13840The monitor is really great and really awesomeNow let's cut the chase and come to the pro and consPros1.The display quality is really better if we compare with some Ips panels2.178 view angle I consider at 1703. respond this is accurate4. Its totally on matte finish and near to bezel less design5. For started just go to display setting and change from 59 or 60 hz to 144hz or 165 defends upon your flavorCons1. The stand is really good with glossy black bottom part with matte finish red But shaking you table make you  monitor a little bit shaker2. Color calibration is not done so do as for your flavorSo these are my thoughts on this monitor I hope this will really help all of you those who want to purchase for gamingHAPPY GAMING
1,"Only had this for 5 months and already having to replace !!!!  I'm REALLY not happy.  I only use this occasionally (probably only 30 times since buying) and it is flickering away like anything.  Did experience a little flicker, a few seconds here and there, when it was only a few weeks old.  Changed cables and updated drivers and it didn't happen again for a while.  But now it just doesn't stop !!!  Changes cables, screen side (have dual display) and deleted and reinstalled drivers .... still flicking.  NOT HAPPY."
1,This monitor worked fine for 2 months and suddenly it stopped working. It is in warranty period so they told they will replace it. It's been more than 10 days now and I haven't got a replacement till now. Very poor service from Acer. No one is able to tell as to when they will get the product from their HO. Really disappointed!
2,"After 1 week of waiting i received a defective monitor although the monitor was working fine but something inside the back of the monitor was broken as i could clearly hear some metal plates (something like that) roaming freely inside the monitor which were hitting something inside and making that metel noise.Also i think the monitor was used because it already had freesync ,overdrive and gsync(in nvidia control panel) enabled already ,also it was already overclocked to 165 hz out of the box, or maybe im wrong and it is suposed to be like that  i ll update my review and rating once i received the proper replacemnet"
1,monitor was delivered on 17 aug and on 11 sept suddenly a blue line ran through the displayi am currently on a call with acer while writing this review and it has been 20 mins since the customer care has put me hold :)))))))ps : will update the review and write hows the acer service
3,"Think twice before you buy. The Monitor has a good refresh rate. But its not .5ms its 10ms and more over the screen alignment is slightly slant towards bottom right angle( i noted this on the third week) . The monitor I received looks like it is refurbished. If you are lucky , you may get a good one, try your luck and chance. However think twice!"
5,Nice quality monitor in such a low price. I have got this monitor at ₹13828. But now the price has increased. I want to purchase more but price is already increased. Please let me know about the same.
4,"There is no other monitors which is available at this price with 144 hz, I purchased this item for 11950/- and for average gaming purpose 24 inch far better. also the design of the stand and holder is very impressive. However the border of the screen is thicker. but we can ignore it when compared to the price . There is no need to think much this  if the price is on offer"
3,"(Edited) Really a good monitor. Brilliant colours. I gave this monitor 5 star but now I am going to 3 star just because of its poor after sales service. Just after purchase I had a minor power related issue. I contacted Acer's customer care. The guy who attended my phone assured me that our technician will contact you soon. It's been almost 3 months no one contacted me. Though I have solved my problem with the help of local technician. Now I realise that if this monitor gives any problem than Acer won't help me though the monitor is under warranty period. In such electronic products, after sales service is very important. I won't recommend this monitor considering its after sales service. It is better to buy lg, samsung etc which provide good services."
5,"Best for gaming I bought it at a great value of 12300₹ 144hz monitor u can switch it to 165hz and it is really awsm picture quality. 24inch is best for 1080 , 27inch monitor will decrease your pixel density for 1080 it will effect your user experience.Recommended for CS:GO players."
4,"I have waiting to buy 144hz monitor for almost year, but i was not able to afford till now. I searched for the cheapest and best feature full monitor at price of 13k. This is best monitor you can get at this pricePros:-1. 165/144 is works as mentioned in the discription2. Freesync is awesome for games. i play pubg pc alot and i usually get fps around 80-100 avg lag and stutter but after freesync turned on it feel butter smooth (free sync range 48hz-165hz )3. Brightness is good4. Stand is good no problem thereCons:-1. Viewing angles are shit if you look straight it looks fine but if you bend a little the monitor get dark in some region2. The Bezel size is too much but it doesn't matter too much. this is the best Monitor you can get at this price"
5,Very good monitor but colour not too much accurate compare to ips and side view angle colours are very very bad but am very enjoy with 144-165hz and 2k resolution gameplays.Pros.1. 144-165hz works very well.2. Freesync enable monitor also gsync support but u need to dp cable for this feature.3. Looking sexy nd stand is very attractive.4. Colours are good compare to others TN panel.5. Brightness are awesome yes it's too bright 🔆Cons.1. Colours are not well don't expect much.2. Side view angle colours are very very bad images shows full dull and blackish.3. Monitor are not steady because stands is small and monitor is to weighted nd his moving by air comes from your ceiling fan and coolers.4. Monitor not support 2k 144hz on dp only work 2k 30hz but works on hdmi well. I don't know why but yeah am face this issue
5,"I have been using 60 hz monitor from last few years... and saw few videos on youtube for higher refresh rate for gaming and tempted to try one. Was on low budget and got this with discount.The higher refresh rate of 165 hz 0.5 delays (which is lowest) and 24 inch just changes the whole experience for gaming. Someone who is in to FPS games and plays daily has to have to monitor. Its a complete package at good price, vesa mount, dp HDMI port, different modes for gaming movies etc.The only thing i miss is speakers but you can anytime use external speakers.All in excellent product and delivery..... very happy."
4,"Monitor goes off for a few seconds and then comes back on, which is annoying. When you are completely dependent on the Monitor screen and it goes off during an important task, then it becomes very difficult. I've connected my laptop to this Monitor and using this as the only and Primary screen by keeping my laptop screen off.Picture Quality is good but I still could never experience more than 60Hz max settings. Manufacturer says 160Hz which seems to be a joke. Getting a monitor at this price should have the best quality. Else someone should simply buy 60Hz monitor screen for 10k and they'll get what they need. Didn't return it because I badly need a monitor at the moment. Overall it's an OK experience and not so great.Update after 1.5 months:Waited for a replacement monitor for more than 1 month and finally my issue got resolved after multiple escalations with the Acer tech support team."
1,"I fall in love when I first saw this I was like omg this is it <3 <3... I would 100% not recommend this to anyone, the worst monitor I have seen.. 165Hz? my phone feels faster lol..I loved it so much I would have given 0 stars if there was an option for it."
5,"First I was saving for Acer 144hz monitor which costs around 13k on amazon but while I was browsing for it one day I saw this one and was surprised that it is just the same as it and has 165hz refresh rate and is also cheaper as I got it for 11,915. I immediately bought it and I am happy I did. Gaming performance is very good if you have a 60hz monitor please consider upgrading if you can. Viewing angles are surprisingly good for TN panel, you can see the display clearly even when sitting on the ground. The display has good brightness and color reproduction. You can tweak further by going into the Nvidia color panel according to your liking. Overall it is the best buy at this budget as no other 165hz monitor is near it in this range."
3,"I have been using this display for more than a month now, Here is my impression of it.The display quality is good and it can be easily used as a secondary display to your laptop or you can use it as your main monitor too.The color production is fantastic and the 165Hz that it provides is something you would love to experience, Keep in mind, Windows only allows 120Hz natively, So you would only get to experience 165Hz in games.The biggest CON of this monitor is its stand, The stand is so pathetic and is really not build sturdy enough. The display would constantly wobble like those bobblehead toys while you are typing on your keyboard on a table. It wobbles so much that it would be enough to annoy you into stop using the display altogether. The display even wobbling while I am writing this review. Giving three stars solely because of the stand."
3,"It's a good 165hz monitor considering the price. But Its stock colors are so ridiculous you'll wanna vomit.You'll have to tweak the RGB, contrast and brightness, and other settings. After tweaking its looking okay.If you do color related work don't go for it. I have an IPS monitor for my work and seeing the picture quality and color accuracy side by side i know it can never be used for color related work.Overall a good product , Just tweak the settings.My settings for this product:Blue light: OffBrightness: 82Contrast: 42Gamma : 2.4Color Temp: User(R51 G43 B55)Overdrive: Normal"
4,The monitor came today with superb packing.Got a good initial feel even after un boxing but it didn't last after I booted the monitor. Got back light bleeding in the left middle screen and right bottom of the screen. Ordered a replacement and hope it'll be in my hands soon. But except that everything is fine but got irritated when playing black things.edited- got replaced today with a good panel monitor without any bleeding and counties enjoying 🤩😍
1,"This is one of the worst choices of my life. Dull screen with very low contrast. Screen is not suitable for your eyes and will cause lot of pain and redness in short time. For me even worse happened, I got dead pixels within a month of the purchase. Very disappointed and would check to return or atleast replace the product."
4,Video Player is loading.
3,"The monitor offers a great value for money for the money and delivers on the promised 165hz refresh rate but has poor build quality...Pros:+ Great Price+ The colors are pretty accurate+ The viewing angles are not super terrible considering it's a TN panel (nowhere close to IPS though)+ Option for a VESA mount is availableCons:- The monitor stand is terrible... It's not stable and the monitor shakes like an earthquake by just touching the screen, It also takes up a lot of space on the desk- The monitor on the stand by default has too much forward tilt with no adjustment options... Paired with the worse vewing angles because of the panel make it a really bad experience watching/playing anythingTLDR: It's a great monitor (for the price) with a terrible stand... I am using it mounted on a VESA stand clamped to my table... If you are buying it, I highly recommend getting a separate stand as well"
1,A big size monitor for gaming but when u connect hdmi cabel atleast 144hz should working but no its only working 75hz with hdmi and when u applay 165hz its not working anymore and when u apply more than 75hz then its flikring and some black line comes on screen so i refund it and give 1star so don’t buy this go with others. And picture quality is very poor very very poor
4,"After using a 20 inch HP 60hz IPS panel monitor for 8 years I finally decided to upgrade my computer's display.My budget was tight and this was the best I found within my budget.The box had a brand new monitor, power cable, display cable, warranty and instruction manual.Now coming to review, out of the box the colour settings are very poor...coming from an IPS panel the colour difference in TN panel is quite noticable. I had to play around with the settings in Nvidia control panel and it took me few hours to set the correct colour settings for this monitor.Now after using it for almost a week my eyes are well suited to the display and monitor feels great. The size is also very big which makes for a great gaming and video experience. I can really feel the difference a 165hz refresh rate and low response time makes. It's super smooth and 100 times better than any 60hz monitor.Overall it's a great purchase. No issues till now. I recommend this monitor if you are a gamer and looking for something feature packed at reasonable price. TN panels are not so bad, casual users can also get it for watching movies or light gaming."
4,If you are searching a monitor for gaming its best in this budget but if you want to do color corrections work either in photoshop lightroom etc. its would not be idle choice for you the color are not good even the white seems to to pale yellow sometime so it might affect itAdvantage-1. Best for gaming in this range2. 165hz that’s amazing and it actually works3. 0.5ms after clocking it and its easy4. Have all types of portsDisadvantage-1. Color are not good its very much saturated2. Content creation cannot be done on this monitor3. Speaker are not loud enough(they should have improved it)4. The box only has display cable no hdmiConclusion-For gamers its the best buy without any hesitationFor content creators avoid it instead buy monitor of lg or samsung
3,In dark areas the banding is horrible and takes you out of the immersionthe monitor has an unfixable forward tiltthe color accuracy is badthe only possible use for this is just office work and gaming upto 165 fps and nothing elseinvest more and buy a better monitor i wish i did that
5,"monitor is nice... 165 hz .. 1920x1080p.. 0.7ms .. 27 inches .. TN panel... as TN is best for gaming.. not for video editor and movie watcher as the color accuracy of TN is not good go for IPS then for that but for only gaming best monitor at budget just at 18000rs when i buy it .. remember the technology used for enjoying 0.7ms response time is MPRT , u have to turn on in monitor settings to enjoy.. btw turning on enhances experience but u can't able to change brightness contrast related stuff, freesync is also disabled in this mode.. the major thing u have to do with MPRT is to turn on every single time u boot ur pc... FREESYNC monitor but if u have nvidia card u can use GSYNC in this monitor as it is GSYNC Certified Freesync monitor (remember to connect display cable for 165hz Gsync/freesync support) btw nice monitor using for 7-8 months no problem at all in starting as it is 27 inches and i jumped to a 27 inch monitor from a 20 inches monitor but if u settled with it one time u cannot able to revert to a smaller monitor again.... and go for it if u get it in deal as over 20000 its not justify it price"
2,I received this hdmi cable along with monitor ... With this hdmi cable I am not able to connect laptop to monitor ... This cable is complete waste to me ... Now I have to buy new hdmi cable to connect my laptop to monitor .... It would be great if I get valid hdmi cable to connect from my laptop to monitor..
5,"First of All my expectations with this was high and it is fullfilled , in the picture the stand is black but u get red black combo which looks op 🔥U can vary it's Refresh Rate from lowest to highest (165.003)Free DP Cable with Jaw LocksIt's 0.5 ms 165Hz Screen is so damn smoothRn I'm using it with my lappy and PS4 gonna build PC SoonOverall i just Love the product"
5,I bought this monitor checked everything it's great monitor just found one flaw of the monitor it has black colour defectiveness cos whenever black colour comes on display then tiny little white colour shows in display maybe stuck or hot pixel so I request for replacement but go for this monitor it's awesome overall 👍
1,This monitor has a decent performance ..But the quality of product is too bad i got a damage product in which there was a gap between the panel and the bezel . I replaced the item and after one week i got the replaced monitor which has the same damage problem ..
4,"1.Best for 1920x1080 gaming. 2. 400Nits super bright.3.Accurate colors. (Need lily tweaking if preferred).4. With Gsync compatible FreeSync On 165hz monitor, you can play warzone high settings at 150Fps(min)  fixated provided you have 2070 super or above graphics"
5,"I was playing Forza Horizon 4 on my old 75Hz IPS monitor and was getting about 90-100 FPSon Ultra settings and when I changed to this monitor I'm now getting 120-140 FPS thanks to the high refresh rate of this panel and also no screen tearing and no input lag from the game. I'm very happy with this monitor and would recommend it to others as well. Though these TN panel monitors are mostly chosen for their low response time for competitive gaming, you can still get one even for non competitive purpose at home. I would suggest gamers to always go for TN panels even though knowing that they have viewing angle issues, it is made up for by their great response time. You'll not regret getting one."
5,"Got this on an offer for 10,700/-I am very happy i got this monitor. AMD freesync comes on by default. No need to go to the trouble to turn it on. Just go to your nvidia control panel or amd panel and change the refresh rate to 165 and see the magic. I play Dota 2 on my PC and earlier i used to play on 60hz. I switched to this and I can never go back. I am using GTX 1070 with this monitor but ill suggest get a AMD card for even better performance. But yeah even Nvidia cards work fine. The games run very smooth and it improvers your gameplay. Also videos and overall use becomes very smooth. I will definitely suggest this to everyone. (only viewing angles are bad so dont buy if you want to build a HTPC)"
5,"When I was buy the price was 12k it's really good too much bright I save my brightness level to 55, it's really good for gaming, it's a TN panel but the quality of the display, colour it really good, you don't face any problems with this display. It's also good for entertainment purposes, I didn't face any problems colour is good."
5,Best budget monitor in this price
2,I like packaging! And no damage as i expected!About led Its work amazing but back light bleeding...Its start flicking so i try to return 2 time.i recognized it was a problem with windows 10 auto color picking..Thumbs Up for great product ....Its worth for money 14K but i think its comes to 12K for good
5,"I have purchased this product at ₹13300. Its been one month. This is great product in this price range.The best feature of this monitor is it is very slim, I mean it is ultra slim. The picture quality is very good.The white color of this monitor is very beautiful.I purchased it for work purpose. Some time I watch movies on it. 75hz refresh rate good for gaming. I played GTA 4 on it. The was running very smoothly on this monitor.I have got some cables like HDMI, VGA, Audio and power cable. The quality of cables is awesome.Thanks"
5,1) Display clarity is superb2) Price is affordable3) No flickering at all4) Can work for long times without any stress on eyes5) Colors are true (While playing games and watching videos)
4,"This monitor fits the purpose and I would definitely recommend it. Please note, you have to buy external speakers with this and cant wall mount it.Picture quality - 4/5 in dark backgrounds at times streched objects appear pixelated if you move very close to the monitor. Not a deal breaker.No screen glare and viewing angles are good.Design - 4.5/5 The monitor looks amazing being so slom and white. The base and monitor conection could be improved to introduce a locking mechanism. Now its slide and keep. With the monitor being so slom there is no wall or bracket mount available - which is fine as you are trading that functionality for the monitor to be super slim.Speaker 2/5 - 2 watts is very less, dont expect to use the monitor speaker, think of it as an additional unit which will never be used.Inputs 3.5/5 1 hdmi and 1 vga port which allows me to connect both my personal and work laptop at the same time.Switching between the 2 requires 4 switch presses in the settings and takes about 15 secs. It would have been great if there were a quick toggle switch to change between hdmi and vga inputs respectivelyPrice 5/5 - after some research, this appears to be the best option as per price.Overall value for money or ROI - 4.5/5P.S havent tested it for gaming, its used as an extended display for my work and personal laptops"
5,"The monitor is very good. It's very thin and looks very elegant. The picture quality is also excellent. Assembly was simple enough.Overall, for the price, this is a steal. The pros far outweigh the cons.Cons :Height is not adjustable.Has only audio input, but no audio out!The quality of inbuilt speakers is not good, the max volume is too low to be useful.The monitor far exceeded my expectations."
5,The monitor is huge. 27inch was way too big for me.❤️ Picture quality crisp and clear.❤️ 75Hz refresh rate and 1080p IPS LCD. So color reproduction is fine AF.❤️ The screen has a matte kind of finish so you don't see any kind of reflections even if the light source is behind your head.❤️ It's extremely thin and modern looking. The white adds some elegance to it.❤️ Bezels are kinda non-existent.Go for it. You're never going to regret any of the money spent.
1,"Too much backlight bleeding..not happy at all with the product. I have 3 other monitors, 2 from BenQ and one from Dell and there is no backlight bleeding in them.This monitor does not meet my expectations even though it is good interms of design but backlight bleeding is not what I needed"
5,"I am So impressive look prity, value for money,So slim,"
5,"Great monitor for 13k price. Only problem is that the screen is soo big, that 1080p resolution seems low quality. If the resolution was atleast 2k for this big screen, it would be totally cool. But overall a really awesome monitor"
5,Very happy with the monitor27 inch is very good size- light weight- white color is just too good (have to order keyboard /mouse and the CPU box in whites though)- resolution is perfect- good for teachers/programmers/meetings/video calls- low wattage speakers is JUST FINEGreat buy
3,The monitor is great. Elegant look. Works great.But only problem which I faced was the backlight bleeding issue. I returned it and got it replaced. But the backlight bleed issue was still there. So finally decided to return and go for some other monitor.Also don't expect too much from the inbuilt speakers.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"This monitor has good colors in display and has a very classy look with the white bottom and back. The only better thing that could have been provided was a couple of USB ports which are not present.Haven't used it for gaming, so can't comment about that."
4,Overall display is very good as picture quality also you want  gaming on this display pls buy.I have faced issue with display. I have received damaged products. Display is bleeding on right Side and top side but I have checked tha picture quality is very good and value of money... For gaming....
5,"The monitor is beautiful so is the color accuracy and the screen. Loved it. No backlight bleeding although had to get a replacement once since the first delivered product had backlight bleeding, but the replacement is perfect. Buy this monitor without a doubt if you are looking for a budget 27 inch ips panel with 75hz refresh rate. Also the monitor is aesthetically beautiful and super slim."
1,An absolutely defective and broken product was sent to me. Don't even buy anything from acer and specially from amazon. It was amazon fulfilled product and screen was completely defective tilting bottom. Save yourself from harassment and don't buy anything from amazon. It is disgusting how big name like. Amazon is looting people. They are shameless and need to be taken to consumer court. Save your money and don't buy anything from. Amazon specially electronics. Better to go to market see things check and buy them.
5,"Quality is A+. You won't be getting a better product at this price point.If u do have a graphics card then it's even better for you ☺️...Though i dont use it for gaming, I use it to watch movies and office work.Clarity is superb."
2,"The screen is beautiful, but the monitor is only in one position. You cannot adjust the angle (horizontal and vertical) of the monitor.Very disappointed.The audio output is bad, no use of inbuilt audio."
4,"Got it for 11,000 - 27 inch monitor and worth for money. I am using it for around 4-5 now and this product was good.  This product is very light."
2,Video Player is loading.
3,For that price it may ok. But lookwise not that great. I don't have an HDMI port. So can't say about picture quality. VGA quality is ok. An above average product.
5,"With WFH being the new normal, I went ahead and invested in this monitor and it has improved my working experience tremendously. Now I have more screen real estate to work comfortably and not get stressed out. It feels so much comfortable.Picture quality is also amazing. And the price - Very reasonable for the offering."
3,"This is a good product for this price range . Bought it during the lock down period in 2020. Picture quality is awesome. Though many say it looks great, i wouldn't agree as it has a plasticky feeling. The Audio quality of this product is not so good. Even if you set the volume to the maximum, it doesn't sound like it.Apart from that, I am satisfied with the product and the delivery."
5,"I bought for 15,490 and still feel that it should not be more than 14K.In build speaker are pitmatic, laptop speaker are better than monitors."
5,Product is good for the value.Very bad experience about Amazon delivery. I was about to cancle the order for giving false reasons for delay in delivery.
4,"Not frameless at all on 3 sides... Acer calls if the bezel is less if the frame is less than 0.8 inches so don't get disappointed after purchase as there is no return option than.... secondly, the AMD sync will only work if the AMD GPU is being used"
1,"Stero speaker sound is very feeble, even my laptop voice was much better than it. Might be a defect and got to know from amazon customer service that the item can't be replaced because of restrictions from seller"
3,"Speaker quality is so bad that you cannot even watch a small video, it is very basic speaker in the monitor. Also the brightness is so high that your eyes get strained even at 5% of brightness."
5,"I am using this with Mac Book Air connected via HDMI.It's an awesome monitor to leverage for office use.I use it for coding,Presentation and video editing."
5,VERY NICE AT LEAST 10 PURCHSE
5,Acer IPS MONITOR is very good 👍👍👍👍
5,Nice product good ultra slim.
5,"Value for money, good picture quality, Not bad for gaming"
5,Good one. Delivered perfectlyGood packing. Working perfectly.
5,☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️👍👍
4,Packaging and quality goodScreen size and feature are good also it provide 2 stereo speaker but sound quality is bad by the way quality and performance good.
4,Really nice picture quality . Happy with my purchase
1,everything  else  is  exciting what  is been marketed  but  paying  RS8-10K  more  not  right  however  1  feature that pushed  me  to get this product  but  after  talking to  customer service  dont agree  to buyMain reason  --  remote accessfrom this  TV  can access  remote  devices ..  Engineer  need  to re-think  not many  will  have  their  devices  on cloud  serverthis  was more  insteresting to me  if this  TV can  access remotely  that is  Over the LAN  any  devices  that are  connected  to this TV  can  access  remotely  but in  current  scenario  its not.so bascially  its just  android  system  with browser  support  not  really  rocket  scienceif this TV can access  remotely  then I  pay for it
5,"Very good, compact and absolute size. No complains. Material is also very good."
5,"I bought this monitor for two important reasons. First one being the contrast ratio and secondly the price.I am more into deep blacks which only an OLED can deliver. So the other only alternative is a VA panel. This model from lenovo can deliver a 3000:1 contrast ratio that no other monitor can do at this price. My primary usage is for work and watch movies.Quick tip: Set the monitor to 75Hz for better blacks and sharpness. The monitor is by default set to 60Hz.Pros -Slim bezels on three sides,Excellent contrast ratio (3000 native) and hence deep blacksNice color reproduction,Gentle on eyes.Refresh rate up to 75Hz from the standard 60HzCons -The stand is very wobbly, so slight movement on the table will shake the monitor.Colors are not so vibrant as our mobile screens/IPS displaysThere is only one HDMI port for connection. So it is a hassle to switch between my personal and work systems."
1,Built and look is good but this is not for Designers who are looking for good color accuracy.
5,Awesome looks. I purchased this for office work purposes.
5,"Good quality, excellent product, worth the purchase."
4,👌👍
1,"Well.. I want to appreciate Amazon Support for all the help.. However, I was disappointed with this monitor as the quality was not up to the mark.. And there was a delay in response when u click on anything.. Unfortunately I have to return this product.. Not Good"
5,very good product in this price. it is working properly. but delivery very late.
5,"I was searching for a budget monitor since last week and finally found this product so I purchased it.The product received on time, working perfectly fine.18.5"" is too small24"" is too bigthis 22"" is perfect for home/office-based work.If you are searching for a budget monitor, go for it. I got it for Rs.7168."
4,Almost meet my requirement- Only Drawback - A wallmount Kit not in Package
3,"Qsg not in box, please provide."
5,"It's fine monitor, I am using AOC monitors since I started using flat screen monitors after CRT monitors...."
5,I like the HD Quality and the screen clarity with superb pixcel.Thank you
5,"Still working fine, and good quality."
1,Bad Display quality
5,"The perfect choice for your new monitor! With LED screen ultra slim design and unique style, with all the technology you need to take amazing pictures. This monitor is perfect for enjoying HD movies, games and much more, the AOC e2270Swn full HD 21.5 “LED monitor provides power packed features"
5,"Very nice led monitor, comfortable for eyes.Thanks Amazon.Amazon delivery is also good.HDMI AND VGA boath are in the box.Viewing angle are also fine."
5,AOC Full HD Monitor Is Nice. Picture Quality Is Average. AOC Monitor Connect To Airtel Set Top Box. I Love It.
1,"See images, product is rated for an input of 1.5A and the power cord provided is rated for an input of 16A.You don't need 16A to power a 24"" 1080p monitor. Even a 55"" 4k TV with HDR doesn't need this much power. Plus the monitor is only rated for 21W, which is not much at all. Now I need to spend extra to either get an after market power cord which will essentially void my warranty or to spend extra on an electrician for the '16A' socket."
3,"No doubt the monitor is good for what I do but the package received had a 16A power plug(big one) which is totally unnecessary for this 21W monitor, and I hate to sit and work in kitchen or in the bathroom which is where we have these bigger sockets in home."
5,"I was strict on budget and the best options I found out were Dell s2421hn, Acer HA240Y and Acer Nitro. Acer offers speakers at same price point but I'm inclined to purchase Dell due to brand value and service as I wasn't sure how good is Acer service network. Out of above three best vfm is Acer Nitro you'll find it priced at 10k occasionally and try to grab it if you are willing to purchase Acer.Pros:- Perfect for office usage, movies and occasional gaming- Great display quality at this price point- Height is perfectly aligned to eye level- Inbuilt display customization. I use it at lowest brightness at most of the times and RTS color settings.Cons:- When compared to competitors specifically Acer, Ben Q they could have offered speakers as well. I use external speakers so it doesn't matter. If you need speakers in dell monitor go for S2421H model and for Height adjustment go for S2421HS (not sure if it's launched in India yet)- This isn't a con specifically it comes with 16 A socket. Research before purchasing instead of rating a product 1 star as the product and it's attachments aren't as you expected. External 6A-16A adapter will suffice and can be purchased at local store for 80 INR at max. depends on your localityIf you need additional usb ports opt for P2419H as it has 4 usb ports and comes with height adjust ability too.Overall I would say it's a bang for buck."
1,THIS PRODUCT SPEND EXTRA MONEY FOR 16A BOARD OR SOCKET
5,"- I needed a monitor for my home use since I am using laptops (Office and Personal) both side by side.- Since the Monitor has dual HDMI ports, it becomes easier to switch between two laptops.- The screen size of 24 inches is more than sufficient for office applications (Email, Office365, Teams etc) and excellent for Internet browsing, YouTube videos.- I am using this monitor in a bright room having ample of Sunlight and its very comfortable to use.- Current settings are set to medium brightness and contrast and it still gives very good results- I am not into gaming so cannot comment on that- Make sure you order a 5/6 amps pin computer cable as well, which I got for @200 on Amazon.- Screen bezels are very narrow and that keeps the physical size of monitor comparitively less.- Highly recommended for Home Office use. I am totally satisfied with the performance."
1,Be careful because item is non returnable. Screen and build Quality is poor. No where it is mentioned in product description or in additional information section that item is non returnable.
5,I really loved this monitor even though I was using samsung monitor previously. This monitor is go for deal.For video and photo editing it's good.But only con this mointor come with 16A powercord.
3,"Good product. 5/5. But the power cord is too large and don't fit sockets, so you have to buy another one."
4,Pro : Nice sleek monitor model from Dell.. perfect for standard gamingCons: 16 Amp power chord for monitor.. HDMI cable provided by Dell will not work 75 HZ refresh rate
5,This price range is unbearable. The screen size is whopping and the resolution really good. Soft to the eyes.Very futuristic design with an elegance that'll make your office setup enviable.
3,I am worry about corner light although monitor was awesome
4,"If you bought this monitor at 10k /- last yr than you are lucky. as for me i bought two of these  during sale at 12.5k . which is already a premium given the feature. the monitor is decent, quality is great, refresh rate is 75 hz and a decent ips panel. but due to inflated pricing makes it a worse buy. if you are not in a hurry, just wait for a bit for price to go down.Another con is this monitor requires 16 A plug power socket. so consider that before buying"
5,Good Monitor. As explained by other users 15 A Power cord is sent. which need to be replaced
4,"After one day use,Pros: good looking, brightness is goodCons: text clarity not that much good, vga is not available, the plug is not supported to the normal switch, you need to buy 16a converter"
1,Screen bleed issues.
1,Just had this monitor for a day and have noticed image burn-in issues on it already.Don't know if the LCD is of low quality for it to be burned-in so quickly (around 2 hours of usage).The monitor does have a option in the Setting menu called LCD Conditioning to get rid of the burn-in and it worked but i will advise to others to avoid this monitor.
1,It had a MPIN power cord. Not suitable for India but for AFRICA. They don't mention that. Guess Amazon doest care who sells here what stuff. Utterly disappointed.
4,"Great monitor, but comes with a 16A power adapter, which is impossible to plug into standard sockets."
3,"Product is good but has 2 negatives,1) The monitor hight does not adjusts, it's fixed2) It has 16 Amp power cord which can be a issue for home use. Usually in flats we don't have those heavy power switches of 16amp that a commonly used in geysers, air-conditioning"
1,Pros-Viewing angleNo screen bleedingColor accuracy is not perfect but okCons-Eyes got too much strained after only 1 to 2 hours of useNo usb c hubI am using a 4 years old dell monitor but still it doesn't hurt eye. But this one s2421hn hurts eye too much
4,"Delivered in perfect condition. Only the power plug is with 16A, hence tough to use with Stabilizer or UPS. For input rating of 1.5A, a 10A plug should be used."
5,"Very Good product from Dell,Excellent pixel clarity anti-glare display,Good Quality body material with metal stand,Good looking design with thin bezel EdgesGood Quality HDMI cable,Standard 16A Power cable"
4,"nice monitor, but why 16V plug?? so difficult to connect to normal socket. is it a high input device like ac, geyser?"
5,"Did a lot of research on monitors which could be 75hz, bezel less, sleek, good quality, perfect looking and having audio out. This is it, dell brings u everything in this monitor."
4,Good monitor but can be better
4,"Good monitor, also good look and performance. Two drop back point, one is it doesn't have speakers and plug is very big, can't fit in regular electric board. It is matt finish screen"
5,"This monitor really worthy. I have bought it at 10,400 rupees. It is diagonally 24 inches. Product and design is really nice looking. You gonna love it. There is no speaker installed in it, you need to connect your speakers for listening to sounds and music."
1,The monitor keeps getting disconnected frequently. It seems i got a used/refurbished product as the packaging was not proper and the default settings were also changed in the monitor. I could not replace it on time as was not using it for some time.
4,"Wrong Power Cord was sent that did not fitting any of the plug points. Upon intimation, the seller promptly sent correct power cord."
4,Was a little skeptical initially but was satisfied by the image quality and the video qualityA good product from Dell.
5,studio
5,Very good and quality and resolution
5,One of the best purchases i have done in a recent time
5,"Amazing product, the least to say. Excellent quality product at fair price."
5,Superb Monitor. Image quality is as expected. We have bought 2 monitors for Work from Home purpose.The only issue is the with power cable.
4,"What is good- No fuss entry level monitor with a hdmi cable included. Good for plug and play.- Color reproduction is okay for entry levelWhat is isn't good- The marketing hype around thin bezels is misplaced. The bezels are as big as they used to come in 2010s.- The viewing angle is severely limited. Works when you right in front of the monitor but not you view from obtuse angle. Should be expected from a VA screen. This is not an IPS screen. But the dell website claims 178 degrees viewing angle.- Comes with default 16A power adapter, the ones used for geysers and heavy appliances."
5,Good for working from home.
4,good...
