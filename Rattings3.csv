1,Fraud alert!This is 10 inches ring not 18 inches!I replaced the product and recieved 10 inches ring again.Do not buy from here.
5,"Bought this 4 months ago and have been using it to mount my phone and shoot and videos.Pros:The adjustable height is greatAvailable length is greatThe holder for mobile also has mobility to tilt the phone for an upward and downward angle (my personal fav)Cons:The only thing I would recommend is to be gentle while turning the screws/knobs as they are a bit fragile and you could easily break them if you handle them too aggressively.Overall, definitely worth the price!"
1,"What is purpose of writing 18"" when light is just 10""."
5,It‚Äôs good worthy for money led brightness should have increased little more so it may be used for outdoor also.

1,"I am a beginner but I quickly realised that this camera is crippled in a way that if Amazon details that info here in the product details (which they must) can change your buying decision. Firstly, this camera cannot shoot videos for more than 29min 59secs (less than half an hour in one go) that too if you are really lucky!For those who thinks that 20 mins on a single video file is enough for them, then you must also be informed that if you don't let it cool down for a minimum 30 mins....the subsequent runs will give you lesser and lesser video shooting duration as it will heat up a lot faster and frequently. In my case the 2nd attempt after 15 mins of recording in 1st go with a 10mins of cool down period, experienced a heat warning at around 5 mins mark! and a shutdown at around 8mins!  which is truly poor performance and makes this camera a joke in terms of video shooting.In general scenarios my a5100 usually shoots for around 10mins in video mode before getting a temperature warning and usually shuts itself down completely after 16-20mins - depending on its mood! (yes mood, not mode!) I am saying mood because, there is no fixed duration for which it can record properly, sometimes it shutsdown at 6-7 mins, sometimes at 15 mins. Which makes using it for video even more challenging, so much that it can be also termed as useless imo and this is when, it is not shooting any fancy formats or resolutions, just simple full hd 1080p (default settings) the performance remains poor...).Also, Amazon has nowhere mentioned this limitation, and none of the reviewers have pointed this out. So there, are 2 issues with this product. 1)the sony's built in video capture time limit per clip and 2) amazon description should state the same. However this can be corrected by Amazon, so that unsuspecting buyers like me don't buy a product which is not meeting their needs.For pictures this is a fine camera.Sad part is, In my case, i didn't find this flaw, which was built in by sony and never communicated by amazon in the product details, went unnoticed as i didn't use the camera for a longer duration during the first 10 days of delivery. Some of the stuff was on the way, the lens etc. so i felt no need to use it for long with the kit lens. I did tried everything just to make sure that its working or not and never put it to record anything greater than 2 mins untill it was too late to return(the return window was also shorter - 10 days in this case).  :(As of now, Amazon has denied the return request and suggested me to contact Sony support. my 2 cents..Do not entirely rely on the information provided by amazon, Just make your purchase after doing proper research using information available outside amazon too...Hope this will help you make a wiser decision."
5,"Awesome camera. Image stabilization is great, good battery backup, awesome focusing, value for money... Compact, suitable for travellers, not bulky, usb charging is always handy, image quality is superb."
4,"Great camera, just started to use. Everything seems to be as expected or even better. The only downer is that you can only look at the screen to see what you are capturing. Under midday/noon bright sun the screen glarez and you cannot really see anything"
5,"I had a wide research before buying this little one and Now, I'm happy that I didn't go for any DSLR. Seriously, if you are a beginner looking for DSLR within 30-35K. You can go for this. This is small & compact. I easily carry this in my pocket wherever I go. I bought this one PRIME DAY sale by 29K. Only problem is that u have limited lens options from Sony & Sigma. So Check once, before buying any camera. I used it for a week & I'm adding some sample shots, I took using the kits lens. I hope this will help you knowing this little baby camera better üòç. Battery is a problem, as this a small camera, so has a smaller battery. So but an extra native or third party battery.Another thing, if you may not feel good enough with kit lens, so later  buy a 50mm f1.8 for better portrait with good bokehüòç.You may add lens available for this camera, later on1.35mm or 50mm f/1.8 Sony OSS ( for Portrait)2.55-210mm f/4.5-6.3 Sony OSS (decent Telephoto lens with decent price) & Check 70-350mm Sony OSS also( New lens for APSC & bit expensive around 70000)3.Sigma 16mm f/1.4 (Auto Focus) (price: 33k, but excellent lens)&Rokinon/Samyang 12mm f/2 (Manual Focus, cheaper than Sigma, 20K)Both are excellent for Landscape, nightscape & Astro photography.That's a complete Package, Put these in a small tiny bag with Camera & three lens."
4,"Good Camera. Only thing is the LCD screen quality is a bit low. Very compact so get a wrist strap along with it. Though a neck strap is included, the camera of this size hanging around ur neck will be a bit award.Things included in my package:1. Carry Case2. Camera with kit lens3. 16GB class 10 sdhc card (but you need a sdxc card to record on xavc format)4. Micro hdmi to hdmi cable5. Battery and its adapter"
4,"Though I‚Äôve used this device for only one day, there might be lot of things I don‚Äôt know about it. Picture quality is better than any smart phone in the market but low light photos (in auto mode) didn‚Äôt at all impressed me. It‚Äôs very handy, light weight and perfect companion for casual photography. There are several apps in this camera and most of them are paid ones ranging (‚Çπ310-‚Çπ620). I don‚Äôt know if this camera supports panorama or not, I wanted to use but I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere.All in all if you‚Äôre into low light photography, like slow motion videos or you‚Äôre a fan of blurred background then this camera is certainly not for you.Battery life is ok.FYI- I used kit lens, using different sony e-mount lens may change the game."
5,"Sony Alpha 5100  is Mirrorless camera!!! Not DSLR!  Beginners should know the difference between Mirror less and DSLR cameras!  Mirrorless is advanced technology! These are smaller and lighter than DSLR!‚úìSony a5100 is a great beginners camera! U can capture GREAT quality pictures(photos) like 4k quality in automatic and manual fuctions in this camera! But this camera is NOT for photography beginners!  It doesn't have viewfinder! Instead it has a touch screen!  So u can touch wherever u want to focus on screen!‚úìBut it is a great option for mini or short FILM makers (beginners). U can film high quality 1080p video at 25fps and 50fps in XAVC format... but u need 64gb or higher XC memory card for filming in XAVC mode..‚úì But a normal HC 16gb memory card is enough to film in AVCHD and MP4 formats.. which are lesser quality than XAVC format!‚úì this camera comes with a kit lens  3.5-5.6 / 16mm-50mm (power lens) u can shoot great wide shots! Up to 35mm.. But a bit dim closeups with 50mm. These lens are good at this price!‚úìif  you upgrade to other costly lens! This camera can give ULTIMATE 1080px videos.. because it has 24MP APSC crop sensor same as A6000 camera!  And almost same as  A6300 , A6500 and A6400 too!!! But these cameras can shoot 4k videos..but A5100 shoot only 1080p videos!!! But great quality 1080p videos in 16:9 aspect ratio!!!‚úìthis is a mirrorless camera.. which is upgraged version of DSLR!!  So it is smaller and lesser weight than DSLR!!  Because of its size and weight.. it is easy for short filmmaking! (For Beginners who knows video editing and film making techniques)‚úì it is a great option for travelers... Vloggers... Youtubers...  Short nd mini filmmakers with little bit film making knowledge!‚úì it contains flip screen.. for selfies and vloging! Inside camera settings it contains  good iso,shutter speed, white balance, peeking, 24 and 50 fps, app store(paid apps) , etc..‚úì it is a good camera at this price point! (30k /-)... Don't expect like  a6500 or a6400 ( 1 lakh range)‚úì if u want a DSLR at this price..!!!  My suggestion is to prefer Canon 1500D at [rupees25k to 30k] and Nikon D3500 at [rupees 25k to  30k]  and Nikon D5600 [at rupees 35k] with kit lens only!  And  other Mirrorless camera Fujifilm XT100  at rupees around 30k !!!  All these above cameras have same APSC 24MP crop sensor!! All of them films 1080px video and comes with  Almost same 16 to 50 mm kit lens!!!‚úì this is my honest opinion.. i liked this camera!! At this price point!!  If u want DSLR.. Nikon D5600 is best!In 2021...  I changed my mind..  whatever I said before  about this before is true. And this is a decent camera for vloggers , tourists, photography.. with good lensüëç..  But if u seriously wants to make a short films.. wedding films.. or even any thing related to creative videography.. don't buy this camera..  go for Sony a6300 or any above models.. a6400 or a6500.. trust me on this.  If u want to make films go for a 4k camera!!!!don't buy this little camera for film making!!But for photography.. vlogs.. this is best for beginners.. but u may need to buy other lens!U can go for canon DSLR cameras in this range of usage.. because canon lens are very cheaper than sony! But same quality!!! But for filmmaking.. trust me.. go for 4k camera.. like  sony a7 series or atleast a6300(cheaper) or a6500(costlier)."
5,"After I placed the order, until it got delivered I kept on thinking that I've spent extra for a camera, DSlR could have been bought for a cheaper price and I could have saved few bucks. I was thinking that, let it come, I'll keep it for few days and then return and order a cheaper DSLR. But when I saw it for the first time, it was okay to me, I started exploring it's options and features and now I'm in love with it. This is really a compact camera with n number of features, options and additional installable apps to make your photography experience wonderful and truly professional. Truly value for money."
4,"I don't really write reviews, this is one of the very few reviews I've ever written in my 7+ yrs of engagement with amazon.to begin with, This camera is ideal for every beginner photographer. With less buttons, its easy to be used but the same will become a trouble when you will get better at using a DSLR and will look for shortcut buttons to access frequently used features.The size is very compact, like really compact. So much that sometimes it wouldn't even give you the feel of a DSLR but will rather look like a point and shoot camera.Picture quality is excellent considering its an APSC sensor camera. Super fast auto focus will prove to be very helpful in cases like street and sports photography. I mostly use it for street photography and its amazing at that.Now lets talk about the elephant in the room - I reckon that if you are reading this review right now you might be on a tight budget, or are looking for an entry level mirrorless DSLR. This camera is an amazing piece of tech but it doesn't have a viewfinder. Though some might be okay with it, but where I found this to be a downside is when I was doing street photography in the middle of a bright summer afternoon. Sure you will be able to see what you are framing in the view finder but the little details that make for a good street shot will be missed becayse the screen isnt really a champ under bright sunlight. I would recommend you to go with the A6000 if this sounds like trouble to you. Other than that, this camera is a STEAL deal and its better than any other Canon Nikon camera out there in the same price range.I am adding a few sample shots shot using the kit lens and the SONY 50MM f1.8 FE lens.for more follow me on insta - @herculiez. Hope this helped."
5,"It's a compact mirrorless digital camera with the option of interchangeable lens. It's compact size makes it ideal for street photography without disturbing the subject by the presence of a large camera body. Easy to carry everywhere. Sony's 24.3 megapixel image is great with real to life colour science. Good image details even if zoomed 50 % in photo editing softwares. Raw still shooting available. Full HD video available with flip LCD screen. If you are looking for an entry level mirrorless digital camera to learn photography without spending much money, this is a great camera even in 2020. Above all its a Sony product. It will not let you down. Note: Since the camera body is smaller it's ideal to attach a safety wrist strap with the camera. Read user manual before installing the lens, charging and to explore the functions and menus. It's a very helpful tip for beginners. Also, while closing the lens cap please be careful not to make scratches on the lens front area. Avoid long video recording as it may cause internal heating. But it's not a fault. Focus is great. Kit lens is ideal for beginners. Read photo books by master photographers...get inspired...start taking photos. All the best."
5,"Bought it bcoz I had a tight budget. Mirrorless is the future whether people accept it or not. Could've gone with cheaper DSLR but my biggest needs were portability and future lenses. You can't believe how small it is. You can put it in your jacket pocket. Bit confusing for beginners. But don't worry guys. You'll get there. And once you do, grt quality pics await there. Got the same sensor as the newest models so didn't bother for A6000. Stock lens is good enough. Keep taking pics. You'll get better. Little guidance from online videos will help. And if you have the budget. Then go for better lens. Don't buy costlier cameras because lenses are not cheap. Loved the product. Very much happy with it."
5,"It's like dream comes true.  You need to do the settings and it gives ultimate pics.  On installing sony software in mobile u can control the camera remotely from mobile and can take memorable family selfies.  This camera has wifi and battery backup is very good without flash,  on flash usage u need extra battery. Go for it."
4,"This is good for learning how DSLR/Mirror less world starts. You must buy a prime lenses (35mm or 50mm) with auto focus and a wide angle lense, with this two lense you can start photography. Please avoid kit lense otherwise you will be disappointed.After some time you can go for full frame camera. APS-C has less advantages as compare to full frame.At the last if u want to learn then it is ok for u, if u want professional quality then it is not u. DSLR world is not for low budget photographer. After purchasing camera body you need 4-5 good lense and lense are costly, some lense are more costly as compared to camera body. You need accessories too like tripod, monopod, Mike, flash, good memory cards, extra batteries, power bank, and  a laptop for processing images.Overall for professional photography budget should be high.If u think so go for it, otherwise purchasing a mobile phone having good camera is better option.Best of luck....."
5,"Edit: Had to return due to1) High quality recording not possible because camera not recognizing industry standard sd card. I used sandisk extreme pro (it's v30 4k)2) Overheating  issueFor this price you can't get a better camera. I use canon, gopro and Nikon as well, so I believe this is the very best option for vloggers, beginner photogs, travel cam and product photography. Slight heating issues/hanging when recording videos at highest quality. I take photography workshops and i found the guide in this cam does half the work for me. If you have more money get a sony a6400."
2,Camera is good if you just want to click pictures.But if you are planning to make videos then this is clearly not a good choice.Camera got shutdown after 15-25 min (depending upon the temperature) due to overheating.If you need a camera for video recording search something else.
1,Waste product of Sony never ever buy this from amazon
1,"It gets heated within 15 min of video recording, no external mic support. It's smaller and light but low light photography is poor. Why are u putting ur money around 28000rs for buying a garbage Just for photos and it's light? Don't waste ur money go for canon clear and sharp images. For this money u can buy a good blogging camera. For blogging always check for external mic and the video recording time"
5,"Bought it for a friend at around 25.3k.The camera is pretty good, great value for money.Major Pros:Great beginner's camera!Budget friendly, fully capable.Major cons:1. No viewfinder2. Video length limitations (present in many sony cameras)"
5,"After using it for few months and taking some beautiful shots on it I found this to be very useful camera and a very handy one. It helps me a lot to take quick shots of subjects, but if you want to get more into photography then buy a lens for this.It serves my purpose of a good quality handy camera, that's it. Thanks Amazon and Sony.."
3,I bought this for live streaming as it has clean HDMI. But you can't live stream more than 10 minutes as the camera gets off by overheating.
5,"+ Low weight and form factor+ Very good Kit lens+ Good picture quality+  attractive price of around 32K for DSLR, mirrorless+ Excellent delivery support by Amazon- LCD screen not bright in sun light/bright areas"
5,"Check properly your packaging and product box as I received a opened seal  camera box, and the box was little bit pressed due to rough packaging. I did not check the camera and quickly placed a replace request.  After one day, I received an order which had a brand new box with a seal (i.e. box was not opened before)  Camera is great. It has touchscreen, wifi, NFC, we can download some camera apps from sony, we can connect smartphone & use it as a remote.  Camera is best for the beginners. Lens is small but enough for the rookies. We can always buy a new lens.  Takes about 75 to 85min to charge completely(2% to 100%).  It can record full hd videos. The flash do not work in videos."
5,"Nice üì∑ it is. Yet to know all detailed features, exploring the camera till now. Happy with the features, n yes it's very compact n small... Can say s chota packet bada dhamaka."
3,Beginners camera if you want to get into sony camera system. Its strictly average in every aspects and less than average in video department because of the horrible overheating issue so do not expect more than 5 minutes because it'll automatically turn off. Picture quality and colour reproduction is decent. Nothing outstanding like i said earlier if you wanna get into sony camera system this is your entry-level camera otherwise look elsewhere.
3,"As the camera gets to have started to blink a red light within two days without a reason later it detect that software problem is there,Picture quality is great ...I am not blaming Amazon .... But the sellers ...used to self somehow defective piece or I can say luck also matters.."
5,Better picture quality in comperison to any IOS or Android phones avalable in the market. Really supurb product from the reputed company SONY. No match at all. I am fully satisfied with this product and reccomend to others. Lack of view finder but it's 180 degree movable LCD screen feature is marvalous. Thanks Sony for this type of product. Value for money.....
4,Camera is great you can upgrade lens to get better photos because the stock lens is no good.I got video recording of about 22-25 mins in 1080p 50fps and with minimal heating.(while recording video please uplift the screen so that heat can dessipate)
5,"Best even in 2019.No 4K. Nit required for me.Awesome image qualityAwesome low lightLight weight.User interface best for travel, family & hobby photography.Easy to use for elders too.Will not be stored inside the cupboard like other dslrs due to their bulky nature"
5,It has same sensor as 6400 which is widely used for video purpose.. stabilization is ok and the main charm is the optics.... Autofocus is the fastest.. never miss a single click..only downside is no Mic Jack rest it can beat any APS-C in market
4,"Very capable at this price point. It takes time to be familiar with sony settings and then it works very well.But one thing is annoying, that is the price of lenses. I bought a 50mm f1.8 prime @ rs 20K. Picture quality is high. I am attaching some samples you can check out."
3,"Like - it is mirrorlessPartially touch screenDislikePixelates and cannot zoom inAuto mode is too sharpNo separat batter charging , it's not that bad"
1,Too much costly and bad performance does not have slow motion video recording
5,Never was a fan of DSLRs due to their bulk size.. But this mirroless are so small and light weight that you get the power of DSLRs in ur pocket..Note: It will not fit in your pocket though..but it will easily come in a small bag.
5,I am new to DSLR type of camera n Sony alpha camera with smart settings is making capturing photos very easy.Its helping me to understand settings with in built guide.
3,Average quality. Non reliable.Mere pass aur bhi joints (action cam mount) hai parr yeh sabse kamzor lagaa. Iske oopar 25k kaa camera lagaanaa sach me risk nahi le saktaa.Delivery was on time. Love it.
4,Built quality was good üôÇ worth for money

4,"Product qualty is solid, working good with my action camera."
3,"There is a feature in this by which you can do backup recording for safety in the memory card, but after turning it on, it keeps recording continuously until you stop it manually. This means that it does not sync with your camera. That is, when you press the record button, it will not record audio in the memory card at the same time. The transmitter that have with the artist may not always turn recording on and off after every shot. If you even think of doing it, then you will be frustrated in a while."
5,"Xlnt budget friendly, and voice recorder inside the transmitter.. xlnt"
5,Good buy... sound quality is good. Audio back up option is excellent.
1,"The seller thought i wont have a measuring tape ? Its around 30"" only in diameter. In photography, the difference between 30"" and 36"" matters. And even if it doesnt it does not give the seller the right to say 36"" and then send smaller ones.The quality of the umbrella is HORRIBLE. The outer edges of the fabric are torn and just unravelling as its not fused together or no seams so the fabric is just disintegrating on the edges.Filed for a return."
2,"Came torn, but had to keep it due to the urgency. The cloth could have been a bit more thicker to make it more translucent."
3,ok costly
2,Not bad
5,Nice and sturdy for home use. Used for couple of times and have no issues.

5,Awesome Product
5,Good 1 but over priced ‚Ä¶.
5,"I had been excited about this action camera ever since it launched. It's an innovative design which makes using it very easy. All the accessories needed are already provided with the product. After first day's initial usage, I love the quality as well.Would recommend the product to anyone looking for an action camera."
5,"Thanks, Insta360 for making such a cool product. I was able to capture some awesome shots I would have never captured without GO 2. The form factor is tiny so it can fit on top or into literally anything.Video clarity, Dynamic range and Stabilization are on par with other action cameras much bigger than this one.Now coming to my feedback on the problems most people fear about GO 2.Storage:I didn't find the 32GB storage so limiting. I take short videos with less than a minute duration rather than lengthy ones. This would give me the perfect output for my Instagram reels and TikTok. Also, it would save tons of time in editing. For this kind of usage 32 GB is enough for one or two days of footage.Transfer speed:I was able to edit the footage from the camera itself(via mobile app) and then delete it. I would save the final output in my phone, not original pro video files. By doing this, I did not feel any lag in transfer. But when I try to download original files directly to my phone via wifi/bt there is a noticeable and frustrating lag. Using an OTG cable to transfer the original file to the phone may solve this issue.Battery:Decent battery backup is one place I feel GO 2 lacks. Usage inside the case gives decent battery life. But most of my usage is with a pendant or head mount for POV shots. The battery drains completely in almost 20ish minutes.Heating:Continues usage like hyperlapse can heat the device. But if it's in cold weather it should be fine. The camera never freezes or stoped recording even if it's a bit hot.Having said about the drawbacks, it would overrule all the good things that this camera offers. I am ok with living with the issues. If you do not need hour-long videos for youtube, posts mostly on Instagram or TikTok as short clips, this camera makes perfect sense."
5,This is my first action camera and to my surprise it's fairly easy to use.. very light weight.. no hassle of carring a battery and battery charger.. lots of attachments provided in the box itself . even the attachment provided does a great job in holding up to any surface.. I was waiting for it to launch in india . And I am very happy with my purchase...
5,"I already have go pro 4, 5, 6 and 7, Insta 360 one x2 and now this one welcomed to complete the family. Falling in love slowly with insta products ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"This camera is feature-packed, easy to use and super nimble.Since my usage was more with POV, the charge on the camera is not enough to pull a recording over ~25mins in cool ventilated conditions.Rest assured, it's a worthy purchase if the intent is to use it with the case."
5,"Loved it. It‚Äôs the perfect action cam in the market as of now. Great quality, the reviews on YouTube say it all, ezz to use. The edit app is just flawless and works great with the OS."
5,"You pretty much get everything you need in the box, you don't have to buy anything extra. It is very convenient and super easy to use. The insta360 app is an added bonus. The video quality is superb even though it can't do 4k, the stabilization is almost as good as GoPro. It's also not as intrusive ae a GoPro. Pov shots are very fun too."
4,Liked - handy to useDisliked-Does not record audio clearlyUse only for recording small clips without spoken audio
5,"First off, the build quality is excellent. Everything feels high quality and well put together. Comes with three plastic trays that are removable if needed. All the trays have a closed cell foam sheet, with one tray having cylindrical grooves.Humidity stabilises within 10-15 minutes if there is a huge difference between ambient and preferred. Once set and stabilised, it stays without much deviation. Inl usually just see a couple of points movement as the day progresses. This is quickly brought to the preferred setting automatically. Do note that fluctuations do happen as this is far from air tight. And you don't need it to be airtight either. However, if it were airtight, you can switch the unit off once preferred humidity is achieved and switch it back on only when you open it the next time.Having said that, the unit consumes power only when the preferred humidity is different from ambient. Else it consumes less than 0.2A. I've attached a screenshot of the monthly power consumption so that you get an idea. It makes next to no difference to leave this running all the time. I initially had it on a timer where it would run for an hour every 3 hours but soon realised it hardly makes any difference.Next off, the size. In my picture you can see the following:Tray 1: 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM II, 100 f/2.8L IS USM, 15-45 IS (Mirrorless Kit)Tray 2: 16-35 f/4L IS USM, 50 f/1.8, 24-105 f/4L attached to M50 bodyTray 3: Sony Action Cam, Batteries, Canon 5D III with grip, Canon 1DXTray 4: Miscellaneous itemsTray 2 has all the lens placed towards the front. The depth is enough to house another couple of lens there. Similar with tray 1. You can judge the depth by looking at the 70-200  (hood installed)An additional tip is to always leave your lens without the front caps when stored in this. This will make sure the lens alwahs gets some light will be an additional barrier against any risk of fungus if you're in a tropical and/or humid region.I wouldn't upgrade to the larger model unless i have significantly more kit. In the same vein, I'd go for the smaller one if I had less kit. This will also prevent unnecessary air in the unit.Overall, highly recommended. I got it for around 13k with a few offers. Special mention for the excellent packaging."
5,Extremely well packed and a high quality product.  I was skeptical as to whether to go for Andbon or this one. Chose this as it was cheaper and I don't regret my decision. It's just perfect.
5,"A perfectly useful ,essential item for photographer.A beautiful product , controls relative humidity effectively. Whatsoever the external humidity is it maintained the internal humidity by 41%. Before super cyclone AMPHAN fell on Kolkata the relative humidity shooted upto 85%. But Hiniso smoothly ran to control interal humidity. In case I take 2 camera bodies & 2 lenses for a days work on street. After they are inserted in the dry cabinet the relative humidity rises above 58% but within 1 or 1and half hour it comes down to 41%.I am extremely satisfied with the product but don‚Äôt know about its longevity ."
5,"I live close to the sea and know that the humidity levels at my place will be abnormally highHad heard about these cabinets and decided to get one after I acquired some pricey lenses recentlyI got a good deal and ordered one recentlyThe cabinet is sturdy and good build quality, seems to do the job wellI was shocked to see the humidity level at around 80% when I first switched it on,  took a while to reach the desired 40% which is being maintained steadily now.Seems to do the job and I feel reassured now as fungus could mean doom for one's precious lensesIt's a very tiny investment to make for your precious gearLastly kudos to the excellent packaging, they made sure it reached me 100% unscathed"
4,Product is as mentioned over the site ...very easy to operate and works perfectly ...keeps the lens and cameras humid free which is good for the longevity of the lens ..has internal lights as well ...temperature and relative humidity can be controlled by switches ..consumes less electricity as well..u have to keep it on always ..overall a sturdy and robust product ...so far so good
5,"Very nice product. Its fitting my 70 200 zoom, 24 70 zoom 4 primes and the camera too. Still there is some space left . Humidity is maintaining well."
5,"The dry cabinet quality & built is very sturdy and good. It has a strong body & thickness. The packaging was very durable with wood casings as well as the delivery was perfect as per expectations.I especially like the copper colour design on the door. It gives a classic look.The space and shelvings are perfect for me or intermediate or semi professional users.The storage allows for many options inside. It can easily fit in easy 2-3 bodies with many options in lenses (5-6), along with gopros, or other relevant accessories to be kept in dry cabinet. The storing depends on the user also.The lock system & door handle makes it convenient.The shelves & foam quality is also satisfactory.Overall a good looking & performing cabinet.Only thing is the labelling says 5 years warranty but as per amazon you get only 1 year and maybe a year extension from the seller. This is the only skeptical part. Other than that all is perfect for the size category."
5,"A long pending investment in my Kit! final call came in recent Chennai storm damaged my precious lens..1) Sturdy construction, good confidence will come for years2) Strong shelfs, good enough for heavy white lenses3) Simple organizers4) Active and efficient dehumidifiersOverall feels like good investment. life need to wait and see"
5,"I have a reasonably good NIKON DSLR with multiple lens, few point and shoot cameras, and camcorder.  Spent nearly 4000 rupees to clean the fungus from Lens and camera  already twice.  That is when I explored the options how to protect them.  Bought this product after reading the reviews.  HINISO AD 80L dry cabinet arrived very safe in well protected packing.  I am happy about the appearance, user friendliness, and I hope it will save lot of money and protect the cameras.  I will also be storing the portable hard drives in it.  It is an excellent product and I already recommended few of my friends to go for it."
5,"Owsome product A perfect item for photographer. The Delivery was fast received the product one day before the expected date, the product was well packed and is a very good¬† high quality product.controls humidity effectively.¬†The seller also is very helpful."
5,It‚Äôs a really value for money. Packaging was awesome and sturdiness. I am satisfied with this dry cabinet box. Those who have telephoto lens should definitely go for 80Ltrs one instead of 50ltrs. A good investment for present as well as future cameras and lenses.
5,"This is really a good accessories for all camera lover, delivered a good product,with a good packaging from Amazon,,wil review more about this product when I have use it for a year ,,now just happy only for delivering a good product,,,love it"
4,"Was worried whether it may arrive damaged but the product arrived very well packed with no damage. Checked the  working of this device by placing another digital hygrometer inside. Values of relative humidity is off by 10 to 15%. When set to around 35%, I get a reading of 43 to 46%in the independent hygrometer, while the internal one shows around 37%. I‚Äôm sure it works but with a catch; set your RH level 10% lower than you actually want and you should be fine."
5,"I installed it two days back. Initially it took about 5 hours to bring the humidity level to below 45%. Then it kept fluctuating between 45 to 42 for almost a full day. Today I haven't opened the door. So, the humidity level is maintained at 40% - 42%. Looks prety good."
5,"Excellent product & it was very easy to install & run the unit.A word about the packaging - absolute protection. The outer package can indicate TOP or üîºWarmth, thickness etc is good & overall a good buy"
5,A very useful item for photographers particularly those who stay in humid areas...
4,The product began malfuctioning after one month...contacted the seller( Camera Centre)..they send me a new part which was very easy to install...now it is working fine...hope this time it lasts long
1,HiI purchased this in September 19 through Amazon  but could not use it at that time.I opened it today and tried. The display just doesn‚Äôt come on . Does the product have a warranty ?Is there any servicing option ?
5,I use this Dehumidifier for keeping Stamp Albums .It was giving troublem.I contacted SARTHAK ANAND of Photo media.I sent him the purchase invoice. He replaced the Motor without any delay.Great service
4,"I received the cabinet in time and good package. The HINISO Cabinet is good looking, compact. The capacity of 80litres should be sufficient for as many as 2big lenses, 4-5 smaller lenses, atleast 2 camera bodies. The temparature and humidity display is good and working well. Overall it is value for money."
5,The packaging was very good. The installation was easy. The design and construct of the dry cabinet is good
5,I do not know the terms used. The product is for keeping the humidity under control. The cabinet is working fine.
5,Best product in the market. The packaging of the box is very good. The seller is very helpful. Good finish comes with good quality. Very much satisfied with the product.
5,Very good packaging. Reached 1 day earlier. Functioning perfectly till now. Coping up with dreadful kolkata mansoon humidity nicely. Using it for storing of my old mint postage stamps. Value for money.
5,Fast shipping. Very secure packaging. Product is excellent and capable of managing RH level bellow 30%. Most suitable for storing moisture sensitive items under very humid room condition.
5,It works fine. i am now quite happy to see my camera and other gadgets are in safe custody. the delivery and packaging system are really too good.
2,Works fine but two of the three trays provided were broken. Delivery package was solid but the internal parts were mishandled while packing.
4,Good product- recommended
1,Lock is not good... Its is very loose. And bad quality lock is fitted
5,"The item arrived impeccably packed. I haven't started using it, so a detailed review will be done after some usage. Looks very promising."
5,Simple to install and use. great product for protecting your camera and lenses. Adjustable humidity levels.
5,Product arrived in a very strudy package.Loved the quality of the product too.Perfect fit for my equipment üòá
5,"I bought 80ltr dry cabinet and it's a very good product, got avarge space for lenses and camera....Must buy üëç"
5,Just excellent product
5,A must for storing Camera Gears in India
1,"After less than 2 weeks, it stopped working. I don‚Äôt have an email or phone number to contact the seller."
5,"Fantastic build quality,all the parts working well apparently"
5,Great purchase. Good price. Like the size. Fits my new 16 inch Mac book pro. Very happy so far.
4,Like the article but I need the warranty confirmation as I am using the product for the first time.
5,"The seller for this was really nice, and helped me with an issue that i had"
1,"The product description is wrong - the seller delivers 10"" Ring lights, not the 12"" as shown on the product page. I had to request the product return."
5,Pretty good product. Especially for this price range. The ring light is bright and can be adjusted in brightness and it's got 3 types of white shades. The Tripod is good too and can be adjusted for height pretty easily.
5,"This product works really well. The ring light is bright, sturdy and durable all settings work effectively, all 3 light colors are equally bright dimming works really well."
1,"Dont buy it bad quality product , those who have posted the good coments have got 100 rs cash back as founded slip inside if dnt trust go nd order - bad quality nd light is also not good remote control switch tooo bad ‚Äî worst product  Try any other"
1,The product is broken and also in a bad condition. The worst think is it is not branded it is a Chinese product. Not a value for money product
1,"Ring light 10""No light, not working.Very bad material...."
5,There product is awesome. Tripod is good in quality and light on weight.. easy to move anywhere. Selfie ring is wonderful and having the assistance lights from dim to high. I shot my first video and the colour quality and everything is just wow. I highly recommend this product for video makers. Brightness is wonderful. Value for money product. East to use and carry
5,"The product is very easy to use.  The brightness of this product can be adjusted in 3 different ways.  The only disadvantage I found was that because of my phone's weight,  the holder bends a little.  But when kept at the right position, it holds properly.  Other than that,  it's a really good product for the price that I got it for. I'm happy with the product :))"
4,"Thank God I have received the product without any damage till now in Amazon. This ring light is perfect for beginners to shoot your videos in decent light. It is a 10 inch one, if you want more brightness go for 18 inch one. But perfect for at this price, it's very helpful for me."
1,They have written wrong Description.very Cheap Products.! Don't buy from this Seller.
5,Product is very goodEasy to installEasy to useWarm and cool light mode make your videos according to your choice.Overall satisfied with this product.Thanks to neeltax5 star for awasome product
3,I had asked for the return but the guy didn‚Äôt turn up and the item is still with me with the defects. The Stand is alright only one of the ring light has yellow patch and hence defective. Please grt it replaced quickly.
3,It's not too bright... May be I was expecting more... If thr is already some natural like then this product is useless... But may be in dark  this is good
5,Video Player is loading.
5,This is a good product and the quality is also too good...i liked it very much..i already purchased many tripods as compared to that i think this is the best tripod that you can get in this price..
5,It's lightweight and comes with two shades of light - white and cool daylight.  Youncan adjust the brightness too.
5,"The product quality is very good, using it for mobile, it is sturdy as well, the lights with it adding icing on the cake. Strongly recommended to buy."
1,"Ring light is not 18inches.Stand is not as strong as shown in the image, the phone holder is lose and does not hold the phone for long...I have oneplus 6 and it is umable to hold the weight of it. Brightness of the light is not good enough. Overall not satisfied with the product."
1,"First of all, the name of the light is misleading. It is not 18 inches but 10 inches only. amazon shound amend its name immediately. Secondly, it is not as bright as it claims. It does have several colour lights but no use if is not bright enough. They didn't provide vertical mobile .Tripod is flimsy and I could not took a chance to install my expensive camera on it. Plse read careful before you buy this flimsy and misleading Cowboy product. I was so disappointed that I gifted it to a young led living closeby."
5,Amazing product. The best about the product is that it is lighy weight with good metallic body.The light have 3 mode. Also you can suggest it's sharpness.Phone holder is also available inside. So it's good to go product.
1,I recieved 4-5ft tripod instead of 7ftVery disappointed be this. Not at all good. Very bad experience with this tripod.
1,Usually the seller say's that the Ringlight is 18 inch but i have got 10 inch i replaced it for 2 times then also they are giving 10inch only very disappointed with this Ringlight! Don't take you'll get 10 inch Ringlight waste of money
1,It's a 10 inch product and seller is misguiding the product saying it as 18 inch LED. Ring Light is small. The Stand has very poor quality and strong enough. Mobile phone holder is different from image shown in advertise. I ordered as assuming 18 inch LED Light but I have received 10 inch so I have returned it and placed replacement order. But I have received again same 10 LED Light. Seller never mentioned about 10 inch LED Light in product information. They are CHEATING saying 18 LED  to 10 inch LED Light. May be seller violating Amazon seller policy. Amazon must think seriously about this (misguiding) seller.
5,I just bought this and have been using it for a few weeks.  It makes recording videos a lot easier and I don't have to worry about the lighting issues anymore. It's very helpful and I am able to set it up anywhere as I see fit.
5,Video Player is loading.
4,I bought this product about a month back for recording videos. Its a good product however being light weight even a slight movement can cause it to fall. You may need to add some weights on the base to ensure its stability during use.

1,We had ordered 18‚Äù ring light. What got delivered is the 10‚Äù light. Quality is also pretty bad. Have asked for replacement as there is no return. Hope replacement is what I ordered and better quality. The replacement is also of wrong size and also defective.
2,"The overall quality of the product is decent, also the brightness is more then suffiecient and can also be adjusted. But the mobile holder could be better.Also I've got a 10"" inch ring light, though its clearly mentioned 18"" inch ring light. Please look into the matter and reslove asap."
5,"As a beginner, I found it really simple to use. The light source is incredibly bright and comes with an adjustable switch to increase or reduce brightness. If you are not sure what to buy, and with a limited budget, then this one is worth trying and gaining more experience with recording your videos or self-portraits."
1,"Be Aware: this is not 18 inches light as mentioned but its 10 inches. Despite getting it exchanged under the category ""wrong product delivered"" I got 10 inches light again Thanks to professional approach of team Amazon that finally I am getting my money back."
4,"Its easy to use and light weight, but the mobile holder is not good as expected. its not fit in a position after attaching mobiles. Its bending down and mobile fells down  frequently."
4,Everything is perfect.. lights are bright too.. however.. there is no stand in the middle of the ring light
1,Ring mobile holder broken.Tripod stand broken.Why are you guys even selling this?May as well buy it from a roadside vendor in less time and with live product guarantee.Sad story.
1,The light was nice for video call etc. But the quality wasnt up to mark. Stopped working within 1 month of me receiving the item (delayed due to covid). Disappointed.
1,Product is unstable .. some screws have gone loose in the beginning itself.The other same product is good manufacturing defect is big

1,This ring light is 10 inch. Last time also they sent 10 inch ring light stating 18 inch in the description
5,Very helpful for online sellers..
2,Product had a number of nuts missing. There is no manual for guidance on how to use the same.
1,"It is a 10 inch Chinese ring light, don't order if you want a 18 inch ring light."
1,Not a reliable product
1,"Broken ring light, very cheap quality product, not satisfied only the brightness is little bit better, but didnt expected this type of low quality and packaging was also improper."
4,Using it for fee months now. Does make everything easy. Quality is delicate. Lights are good
1,"it is not the same as mention in the discription.they show 18"" size in discription and sends 9"" light this happent twice.in replacement i received 2nd hand light with lot of scratches on it. i dont want to give even a singal star for this prodouct."
1,twice they have sent 10 inch ring light instead of 18 inch ring light. misleading ad.
5,"I was very reluctant about buying ring light online but this made it perfect....this is the best ring light you could ask for so my advice is go for it, the packaging is good the quality is good. Its a steal at this priceüëç‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"Good buy. Albeit the brand name is Sonia which is written on the hood but not mentioned anywhere over here. I use it on the 55 - 250 mm lens and the kit lens. No issues with it. Thread is good, screw fits snugly onto the lens and rotates smoothly in and out. You can look up the photos I took using this hood on my Canon lens in my Instagram account (grid of photos posted below)Instagram.com/photodeepto"
4,"I saw in reviews tht, its a bad product.....but, i hv no prblm with this....its suitable in 18-55 & 55-200 mm lens.......and one prblm is smtimes a shade is comming in 2corners of image.....then v hv to adjst the hood."
5,"I have a canon 1300 D with 55mm lens and this lens hood is of 58mm , initially i was a bit dicey about the fixture but turns out the inner rim frame of this hood is quite a fit. Quality of the material is also worth the price range. I even tried taking pictures with the hood on and it worked really well with the sunlight and glare factor. If you are looking for a quality lens under a eco price range, i would recommend to go buy that now friend. ü§ô"
5,Got the hood because of all the threat from YouTube about sensitivity of optical lenses. This hood fits perfectly for canon 1500D. Look of the camera is much better with hood and it serves dual purpose of filtering out stray lights and protection for lenses. Must buy for beginners while handling camera first time.
1,"It just doesn't fit EOS1500D. Tried replacing it but even then 2nd one has got only two things...the ring an dhood...the bracket is missing...can't return it..so, yeah...wasted money!"
3,Not fully satisfied with the product....Found it a little of cheaper quality than my expectations but it's a nice fit on my both lenses and that works for me....Sometimes safed do come in the pictures but after a little adjustment of the hood it's ok.My final suggestion is if you have a handsome amount of money go for a pricier option.
4,"Minimise over expose of sunlight to the camera, Quality perfect and value for money. Only make sure that Hood should not fit in horizontal postion coz a little portion of it captured in image especially when you take photo in Landscape mode."
5,"It easily fitted in my 18-55mm lens. The type of material used could've been better as this price range. Rest assured, you can go ahead and place the order."
4,Perfectly fit's with 18-55 mm & 55-250 mm canon lens. Quality of the material is also worth the price range. And it does helps during clicking pictures in daylight. Good Lens Hood for beginners
3,The product gives you the performance(quality based) for the price that you pay.It is a bit wiggly when fixed in the front facing position. But fits perfectly when it is reversly fixed!
1,This is another cheap plastic varient of lens good. The threads have started wearing out. The hood corners comes within the picture frame effectively destroying the clicked effort.
4,"The quality of material is awesome, the fitting is perfect too, but handle carefully, otherwise the lens may get damaged."
4,Good quality material worthy buy Fits well with my canon 18-55mm Lens as well as 55-250mm Lenses.
5,"It's really very good product, I have ordered for my canon camera 18-55 lense, it's really fits well, also quality of this product also very good,who is planning to bring this lense hood, ofcourse you can buy this."
1,This is totally not fit for purpose. I used it on a 28mm lens and it causes serious vignetting and that makes it useless for me. The design is innovative and all but not useful.
1,"this hood quality is verry poor and most of that it dose not support 18-55 lens, so be careful"
5,"You can find the product as value for money , quality of material and for beginners ."
1,Very cheap quality... And it's edge is showing in photo.... Not recommended this type of hood which have their own ring
4,Well it suits proper in the canon 1300d camera lens but I did not find any difference in photos may be professional photographer can find it.
1,It fits perfectly in 18-55 lense with my 200 D.  But a small shade is coming in the four courners of the image if there is no any zooming when taking picture. No bulid quality its normal plastic but for this price its okay.
4,"This is my first purchase on lens hood, so far looks good and fits nicely. I will update after some time and photosessions."
5,I wanted a Lens hood for my Yongnu 50 mm lens. This hood fits perfectly.
4,This is very nice but what you want in your camera means in round shape or in flower shape that you have to be noticed.thanks Amazon.
1,This product has no any protection glass.. It's just a waste of money.. Useless pdoduct.. I want return asap&refund!!
1,This product does not fit my 18-55mm or my 55-250 mm lens which the advertise will fit. I wanted to return it and found out that it this is a not returnable item. So consider before buying.
3,At extreme wide like 18mm 22mm position it appears in photo.When lens hood is fit on the lens-lens cap can not be fit to the lens.
5,"The Quality of the Product is Awesome, Highly Recommended"
5,Nice product. Easily fit into Canon EOS 1500D. I ordered it and first I received only the lens hood. The connecter was not received. I opted for replacement. They shipped me and replaced the old item. Quality is Ok.
5,"It's true 58mm lens hood, this one is good I have ordered one before with other seller and seller repeated resending same not compatible product"
5,Material quality isn't that great but it's not even necessary. Spending more for a lens hood is a no-brainer when this too does the same job very well.
5,This my canon 55mm suitable
4,Very good quality awesome
4,not of high quality. might break if you apply high force. but good for it's price.
5,"Amazing product, Value for money. If you are looking for a quality lens under a eco price range, i would recommend to buy this."
1,"Basically I ordered it wrong, and when I tried to return it, they didn't accepted the return"
1,I tried with the kit lens 18-55 of canon 200d ii. The hood interrupts the lens view and it shows in photos.
4,Nice
1,After attachment with cpl filter i can see the rectangular black edge on my live view screen if trying to take a wide shot and quality of plastic is hard and basically not value for money product.
4,"It is not suitable lense, after lot of effort only you can fix this hood to lenseSo I got a replacement with a new one, which is perfectly matching with lense"
5,Support Cannon 1500D 18-55 and other lens too
1,It‚Äôs  flimsy and instructions all in Chinese . It‚Äôs an imported item which was not explicitly mentioned on the site. No SD card !!
4,I am photographer is colour very beautiful this canon EOS 7D Mark II i like this my camera...
5,Definitely recommended for those going into speed photography. Best model so far
4,good feel and worth it.
5,Superb camera and getting lovely images.
5,Fantastic camera. 10 FPS is like shooting from a gun and very much essential for bird photography. High ISO photos are very clean and usable. i had a one week of birding photography with the camera and very much satisfied.
3,Excellent camera but after guarantee period was over I always got error 30 and the Camera is now out of use. On net I found that 7d mark II model has this problem of error 30 in common. It relates to shutter and this appears to be its weak point. Cannon definately needs to look in the matter as it's credibility is at stake.
5,best camera ever.... i also used a 80 d but this 10 fps feels like heart blowing...
4,Battery and memory card  include in this pack?
5,Just awesomeBest in aps-c type sensor camera amazingly fastExtreme low noise at 5000 iso in indoorBuilt is superbCompared to lot of brands and many full frame its a great compilation for full frame
4,Is best professional  camara I am in using
5,awesome product it is jusr awesome .......\no words to describe it is cheaper than the market price
3,depth is not good
4,"price reduced from Rs.129000/- to Rs.123000/- but no battery.i.e. you are having a teeth but no ""channa"" and if you are having ""chana"" but no teeth.hence reducing the  price is no meaning.reply me the refer camera is including battery and charger or not?"
5,Excellent
5,"i am not buyer of this product, but i wish to buy."
1,"Such a waste of money.Why would you buy a camera with a crop sensor for over a lakh. It simply isn't worth it.Instead of spending 137000 on this, put in 10 grand more and go for the Nikon D750. That's a full frame and one of the best cameras in this price range now. If the budget is an issue, Nikon has the D610(body only) that's below a lakh, and invest the rest in a good lens.I don't see the point of spending almost one and a half lakhs and still buying a crop frame.The additional features are superficial. Not all that useful. I'm using a Nikon D750. Its simply the best."
5,Good
5,"Just got it so haven't tested it in the field yet, but seems to have sturdy legs that extend very, very high with a surprisingly fluid head that has no jerking motion its lateral or vertical motion. After more usage, if you have a heavy camera (I use a audio recorder on top of a large camera), I found that it tends to slip backwards unless the tension is tightened very tight, at which point it becomes hard to move the camera up and down, so I am going to attach a different head to it but still use it for the height, which is very good."
1,The advt is clearly misleading. In the product image they show three steps of.extension for the tripod. But there are actually two only. So what they are showing in the image is a different product. Also the attached mobile stand is that of cheap quality. Simpex tripod do have its own quality whether is two step or three step. But seller provided the wrong photo.
5,Very Good Quality Product
1,What I received was Elois vct988. There was no Simpex branding on the product or on the box. The carry bag for the tripod was torn and repaired by tape. I had to return the product.
5,"This product is superb.I have bought it my for my teenage son, and he is so happy with this product.It's Easy to use and quality is very nice."
4,It's OK as per price. Not for outdoor activities.
5,Very good product.Value for money
2,"Although it says 3 kg, it tumbles when used with additional lenses."
5,Not light weight. But it's brilliant product. Worth it.

5,Good
3,"It was a good and decent Tripod for beginners until for an year. After that, some sort of sticky oil is leaking in all the rotating parts, which may damage your camera later. Beware of that. I didn't expect the product will damage this much quick. Other than this, there is no other trouble regarding the stability and its rigidness for the money you spend. Attached some sample images, where you can see the leaking oil. This was my personal experience."
1,"The seller thought i wont have a measuring tape ? Its around 30"" only in diameter. In photography, the difference between 30"" and 36"" matters. And even if it doesnt it does not give the seller the right to say 36"" and then send smaller ones.The quality of the umbrella is HORRIBLE. The outer edges of the fabric are torn and just unravelling as its not fused together or no seams so the fabric is just disintegrating on the edges.Filed for a return."
2,"Came torn, but had to keep it due to the urgency. The cloth could have been a bit more thicker to make it more translucent."
3,ok costly
2,Not bad
5,Nice and sturdy for home use. Used for couple of times and have no issues.
5,Product quality is good
5,Nice
3,Nice quality and amazing brightness just that this is not 14 inch at all this is 12 inch for sure that‚Äôs the mistake else all is good and quality is also durable

5,Good camera
5,"This is the best all-round dslr camera ever made by Nikon. Never regret it. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Bad camera
5,This is a fantastic camera
4,Good
5,"Only disappointment is it took 6 days to deliver. But its great camera1) Packaging: very well packaged2) content in the box : body + lens with hood+ memory card + usb cable + charging brick + battery + camera strap + external charger with cable (which is extra üòÅ) + paper work +warranty paper + camera bag3) its well reviewed camera for Youtubers, such a great camera for still, portrait, light, wild life, fast moving subject photography, videos , video 4k 30fps full frame sensor"
5,"The build and make of the product are of utmost quality. The packaging was good. Although it arrived with cover wrapped on the box, so one could easily see that its a camera that is being shipped, but the package arrived safely. Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.The package contained all the items listed in the product detail page. One thing that got me confused before buying was if a memory card is supplied along with camera or not. I have received a 64 GB memory card in the camera box.Pros1. Light weight. I have used Canon 6D and it was so bulky and used to hurt my neck while carrying around.2. Fine grained control over focus. The manual focus is next level!!3. Eye Autofocus works like a charm.4. Electronic viewfinder and the options to configure what should appear in the viewfinder.5. Wide array of e-mount lens available to gear up the camera to the next level.Cons1. Although connectivity is great with bluetooth and wifi, the smartphone app provided is not that great compared to canon's connect app. Also the wifi gets a random name for the smartphone to connect to."
5,"Fabulous product. Awesome quality. There is no match to Sony A7m3 at this price point.  The package included a battery charger, a 64GB UHS 2 SD card, a camera bag and 1 year additional warranty on registration apart from the standard 2 years (total 3 years). You need not buy any other accessories apart from a screen guard for first time users."
1,I didnt receive the charger BC QZ1 which is supposed to be there as a bundled pack also sd card is missing
5,"Okay, first the product delivery. ONE WORD AMAZING !!! The entire products with Bag, external fast charger for the battery and the camera with kitlens came packed in a giant box. Coming to the camera, it's just awesome. I haven't yet checked out all the kinks of the camera. But its built like a tank.I have uploaded the entire unboxing in my channel.Will upload some awesome videos in my YouTube channel ""Impulse Drifter"". Watch out for the updates there."
2,Memory card and camera bag which was told to be with the kit wasn't provided by the seller. What is the point of spending for the bundle pack and paying so much.
5,"It's an overwhelming product for a beginner user of a full frame. Quality of photos and videos produced with this beast is over the top notch quality.Received a camera bag, external battery charger and 64gb fast memory card extra with the package üì¶I'll be uploading my contents produced with this beast on my Insta @themozammelWill update again after few weeks of usage ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,"The camera is fantabulous. Though I am getting my hands into photography, I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed using this camera. This being a very popular and capable camera model, you will find lots of guides and tutorials on how to use this one. I was also considering a6600 against this one, which is a tad bit cheaper than this model. But a6600 being a APS-C sensor camera, a7iii is better than that, this one being a full frame."
5,Very good for photography and good video tool. Auto focus is fantastic. 10 bit recording not there but okay for most since its too difficult to manage file size and editing at that resolution.
4,I am a intermediate Photographer. first of all it was a risk of this much big amount from online store. I trust Amazon from the first and I am an Amazon prime member since 2 or 3 years . Delivery was good .Thanks Amazon . I am starting to know the camera it‚Äôs a beastüî• . And I also trust Appario (seller) it‚Äôs a well known seller . Thanks for everything I will keep updating about the cam ü§ò
5,Camera is great. Well packed but  memory card was missing üòî
5,Everything is perfect except received a 64gb memory card instead of 128gb.
5,No cons for camera.. absolutely brilliant. I didn't receive memory card as mentioned in the description. Even in the box it is bundle offer. But it is missing in the box.
5,A superb camera having all features.

5,"The Sony Alpha A7 Mark III is the third version of Sony's 24 megapixel full-frame mirrorless camera, and offers exceptional image quality, high quality 4K video recording, and high speed continuous shooting.+ ProsFast and reliable focusImpressive noise performanceExcellent image qualityFast continuous shootingHigh-quality 4K video recordingExcellent lenses available"
4,"Best dslr for beginners. Loved it...Lightweight and compact with everything the family photographer needs, the Nikon D5600 maintains its position as a great general-purpose dSLR for its price class.DSLRTaken on its own, the Nikon D5600 is a fine camera, with imaging tech that still outclasses what even the best smartphone can manage by a huge margin. That's an important point to note for people looking for..."
5,"PROS-Exceptional picture quality.-Nikon's colour science.-Great Low light performance.-Battery life.-Flipout LCD.-Great for filmmaking.-Small size.CONS-Auto focus in video is disappointing.-No in body stabilisation.*Pictures are shot with 85mm 1.8G,  85mm 1.4G and kit and are edited."
5,"Worth the money. I am a beginner in terms of photography. The telephoto lens are really good and pictures taken with then are truly awesome. They give the photos kind of a depth field perception in auto mode. The camera itself has heck lot of options and having a touchscreen really helps.Piece of advice, If you are planning to buy a tripod along with this don't buy small ones as camera with lens tends to get heavy. I bought Amazon basics tripod and it was unable to handle the weight of camera with telephoto lens attached."
5,"I upgraded to this camera from D3100 & Sony HX400V.This camera is loaded with features. One of the best entry level professional camera or a great camera for amateur photographer. With my last DSLR i had 18-55 & 70-300. Having understood the difficult in changing the lens every time this time i went with 18-140 lens.The camera is light weight, handy, menu is easy to understand, connectivity to mobile is awesome. Also installed Helicon Remote app & Adobe photoshop express app in mobile which makes easy to take picture, send to your mobile, edit & upload.Lens is little heavy as I expected, but the clarity, focus response, sharpness is great.Unlike other reviews i got a good camera bag.Without any second thought you can buy this."

5,"For a beginner, this is more than you can bargain for. It has a fairly decent f stop range for you to play around and control exposure.The best part is, it has all the requirements of a DSLR, as in i was surprised to see it has exposure metering modes as well. So when i was learning from a tutorial, whatever photography jargon they threw around i could try it on the camera.The camera itself is very light. The lens make it a little bit heavy. I found the bag to be a bit small. It doesn't fit well with the lens on.Update - 4 months into usage and im loving it. I have clicked some 1000 photos till now and they have come out beautifully. Buy the proper lens for the scene and you're good to go with this camera."
1,Components are missing
5,"After hundreds of reviews of various DSLRs , I decided to buy Nikon D5600, also a professional photographer suggested this for my purpose, I went to many local dealers and lowest price in local dealer was 54500/-, but luckily at that time Amazon offered great Indian sales and price was 49990/- from appario retails seller, and also I got  sbi card 2000/- instant cash back and 1000/- Amazon pay balance cash back, also waiting for 3000/- cash back after return period is over, so effective price will be 43990/- and that's an unbelievable deal.But sadly the seller shipped through Gati courier which is one of the worst couriers and they delivered the product after 15 days of shipping and the delivery boy called me and told that my area is not serviceable by them and so I had to collect it from 7 km distance from home.The camera is awesome and looks much premium, picture quality superb, Nikon bag is good but it doesn't have space for extra prime lens after putting 2 kit lenses.I don't know why the seller didn't give the learning CD and the freebie Samsung Bluetooth headset, freebie sticker was removed from the pack and it was obvious. And also warranty card was not signed and stamped and I think it will be difficult to claim warranty, but Amazon customer service told me that they will solve the problem. Over all good deal and superb camera. Thank you Amazon."
1,This product show one on screen and deliverd any other china make camera slr  see like dslr
5,"I was confused between both, canon has more users and lens are cheaper for the same focal length. I am glad I chosed Nikon over Canon. Canon is great but Nikon has extra hand on photography. Canon is better for video.And I don't have to mention about picture quality. It is best at it. Attaching some pics. Do have a look. Cheers ;)"
5,"Camera is top notch, as a beginner I'm very much excited to learn...I brought it from the seller, Appario Retail...They provide, Nikon Camera kit with 16GB Toshiba memory card and a side sling camera bag(may be not authentic)...This review is for those who are confused or want to know about what comes in package brought through Appario Retail..."
3,"I received the camera & lens including covers & battery. However, no camera bag, no memory card nor even the Samsung bluetooth headset  sellers & Nikon India are offereing with this camera since Aug 2018!! Refer Nikon India D5600 page.In addition, Nikon India says ""In reference to your query, none of the e-commerce sites are authorized by Nikon India, therefore, we cannot comment on it"".I can not even test the camera without the memory card & not risking handling it, if the item is required to be returned due to the issues mentioned above!!"
1,"As written in the product details, no bag was provided with camera."
1,"Fist of all Amazon will not give a proper invoice with warranty serials mentioned on them. After using my camera for one and half year I got an issue with camera and landed it in a Nikon service center. They simply denied servicing it because of no warranty serials mentioned on invoice copy. After that I took me more than one and half month and at least 12 calls to Amazon customer care , trying to explain my issue with them for at least 1 hour call each time. They promise you issue will be resolved but they don't take action finally after a month when I spoke to their higher officials they initiated the action.So please stay away from buying cameras from Amazon . It will give you mental trauma to deal with the Amazon customer care"
5,Best one at this price range...I got this at 44k....working good so far...will update the review feedback later as there is many feature to explore üòä
4,"Having used a D-3300 I can surely judge the difference and value offerings.With all the buttons / features at the right place this DSLR is a good choice for Beginners.Light weight compared to others does help in handling. Having 39 AF Points definitely helps beginners to get better output and does help Experts with a wide scope.Pop out touch Screen adds up convenience and Better Photography along with a Creative touch.Did not test the Video recordings, hope to be better. D3300 video output was a good Experience.Going for D5600 at bargain price was a better decision rather than having D3300 as regular buying.Kit Lens output is Comparable to Prime. Although not as good, but you save on add on price and Zoom benefits with no extra $$."
5,"My Experience -I am using this camera for more than a year now and never had any issue with it, and I loved the experience with it,it is easy to use, very quick to set up, feature-rich, and value for money DSLR.Touchscreen and Wireless connectivity add the cherry on the pie.It has too many features so the battery may exhaust faster than other standard DSLR cameras, many people have escalated this as a very critical issue, but believe me, all it needs some fine-tuning, simply understand your camera and turn-off what you don't need and it will also perform longer.Who never used a DSLR -if you're looking for an upgrade of your Digital Camera and happy with simple point & shoot methodology then this camera is not for you, you're simply burning money. Apparently, this can do what you want but better look for some better Digital Camera, This has too much to learn and understand, Some free photography lessons on YouTube can help and but still you need to practice as much as possible.For the Beginners -It is very good (not the best) for beginners as there are many advanced features which would require some level of external help/guidance. Honestly speaking, a beginner can not unlock the full potential of this camera or would take some time. Believe me, I'm in photography for a while, still learning, but yet this Camera amazes me with what it can do."
5,"Nikon D5600 is a good entry level camera. Nikon D5600 gives you some additional features in the segment. Means you can get some advanced specifications than a normal entry-level cameras, such as D3400, Canon 1300D etc. Most of its fundamental features are pretty polished. The user interface is (for the most part) well designed for the target audience, its ability to keep moving subjects in focus is very good for its class and, most importantly, it'll readily take excellent photos.Despite only being a very modest upgrade to the D5500, the D5600 is still a very capable advanced entry-level DSLR. This is a camera which is very much a sum of its parts rather than having one single standout feature. There's a high-resolution 24.2MP sensor which produces very detailed images, an articulating touchscreen, a decent 39-point AF system and polished handling are some of the highlights that make the D5600 one of the most well-rounded entry-level DSLRs available.ProsExcellent image qualityComfy handgripDecent AF systemTouchscreen interfaceConsSnapBridge needs workOnly 1080p videoPricey compared to rivals"
5,Lens was missing with the combo product and hence returned .Otherwise it nice product .carton is same for both product i.e with or without AF-P 70-300 mm VR Kit  so I have order combo but received without AF-P 70-300 mm VR Kit .Please ensure in future prior to dispatch of product
1,Camera couldn't be on till now. Battery is full charged..What's defect I dont know....want help otherwise will return this product
5,"This is 1st DSLR Camera of my life. I did lots of research before buying it. In general market cost of this camera is about 62k but in amazon I got in about 48K with amazon cash back offer. actually, I looking for a camera for astrophotography but the price of such a camera is too expansive for me so I'm looking for a camera that meets my need but not holes in my pocket, then I start researching about this camera & I found that astrophotography is possible through this camera (as because of higher ISO) but not that extent of NIKON D810a. then I decided to buy it ."
5,"Its my first DSLR. I will skip the technical details. All i can say is that it takes excellent pictures, even indoors with poor lighting. That fulfills my need, a camera that captures the real thing with faithful colour reproduction. I would recommend it highly.Snapbrigde works but is not easy to use.Buyers in Amazon must choose their seller carefully as not all sellers provide the same accessories, and quality of bag provided differ from seller to seller. I bought it from Appario retailers. Heres what was included:Camera body2 Kit lens (18-55 mm and 70-300 mm)1 camera bag (rather cheap quality)Battery and charger16 GB cardNikon original strap"
1,"I ordered 18-55mm and 70-300mm kit with bag and memory card, worth 51000 thousand, but they delivered 18-55 mm vr kit. A small suggestion- don't buy with appario private LTD."
1,I bought this camera and when I checked inserting a sdxc memory card from sandisc ..it gave me a very poor quality picture and I guess that's the AMAZON has only replacement but no return on these kind of products..Amazon org definitely knows that ppl will not like this product and to lock the return and to enjoy the benefit out of customers dissatisfaction..they deny to return..I called and expalined them that you keep the money I will choose a new camera and I will pay extra whatever it costs for me..but they didn't react to it...such a good exploitation...and upon this they suggested me to buy a new one with different order..they think I'm dumb.....DEAR PEOPLE IM ONE OF YOU...don't GET IN TO THIS Exploitation
5,Very good product. Go for it. Well packed and shipped. Genuine product. I've registered with Nikon in online. The only problem is the connectivity with smartphone. Sometimes we have to try connecting for 5-10 times to connect with your mobile. It's little frustrating but apart from that pictures are great. No worries till now. Will update of any in a few days of my usage.Dont look back it a semi mid range DSLR.  Better than any entry level camera out there. You won't regret this one. don't waste money on a costly body. Spend that money on a premium lens. I am even looking forward to buy a 50mm or 35mm lens.
5,"Truely speaking Nikon D5600 is a rock star for Photography Artists, this is my second DSLR after Canon EOS 1500D. Honestly Nikon D5600 brought true colours to my photographic journey I have seen many reviews stating Nikon D5600 as the DSLR for beginners  but my experience shows this is as a professional DSLR for those who are interested in Astrophotography and nature photography with highly reduced noise level for long exposures Nikon D5600 shines as DSLR rock star, you may find the below pros and cons.Pros :Awesome shooting modes39 Autofocus points makes the job easy for you180 degree tilting LCD excellent for effortless photography and Beautiful Selfies70 - 300mm kit lens is an excellent telephoto lensLow noise on long exposuresGood battery backupLess heavier than other DSLRsBang for the moneyCons:Needs to improve on Autofocus on video modeMax ISO is 25600"
5,"It's been 6months I started to use it. Very good camera for beginners but not for professionals. Because the lense that comes with this can't be used for indoor photography or wedding like celebrations. As a hobby photography, I recommend this one. It is best in its price range and it's genuine Nikon Product. But Pls learn all the settings. Without that u can't be a professional. Go through fee YouTube unboxing reviews. Later don't blame it's manufacturer or the Amazon.If you budget buy a DSLR Flashlight. U  will enjoy photography. Buy lense suitable  hoot, that makes you to feel that u have become a photographer.Thank you."
4,"It is a great entry level DSLR to have.But one needs to invest only if intend to pursue for a year or more.Lenses, flashes, tripods all put a dent in the budget and lead to second thoughts on having the D5600.Found the sensor extremely good and response time was fabulous. But having said that it is a bit bulky and the price tag sometimes does not justify its position as an entry level camera equipment. In very good lighting conditions some smartphones can match the photo quality. Raw shoots come out very nicely and render without edge and corner anomalies. ISO grains also very not visible at high values. One confounded thing I noticed (maybe only with my unit) was that the auto stabilization was not working as expected.Video recording is a definitely not the best and capped at 20 minutes per shoot. Battery also drained heavily in video mode.Nikon should do something about the software aspect as well - considering its all digital photography. Neither is NX-D anywhere near as good as the Adobe suite nor the Snapbridge smartphone app works well with the camera. Was particularly disappointed with the app since it could have been a great way to get to share the photos immediately to the wider world. Instead what we get is a bluetooth based connection which is outdated and an extremely dodgy Wifi setup which tests the patience of the user.Overall I would say its definitely punches its weight as a camera but Nikon should be aware that a camera itself on its own does not mean much these days and need to productize as complete set of software and accessories provider in a easy and inexpensive way."
5,"Hi All,I bought this camera on the first day of sale. Got it on MRP showing 46999 and after discount it costs me just 44k. Great deal guys . Must buy for beginners.NOTE: Those who are facing issue with duplicate products, missing items, defective pieces,etc. Please avoid purchase from any other seller except Appario Retail. I bought this camera from Appario Retail and got all the products in good condition including nikon bag and memory card. All original products.Also, don't forget to register ur product on Nikon website to claim warranty."
1,"I purchased this item from amazon(price.perfect) seller. Product was relatively cheap and seller review was good so i bought this camera, Camera is working fine but product was not sealed, battery is seems like used and other items were also not packed properly inside the box which suggest that it is used by someone. Not happy with this kind of seller.product is good , need to buy a good lens separately as 18-55 is give just ok pics."
5,"Unexpected : 16GB Card,Nikon brand logo Camera Bag but not mfg by Nikon.Import Date: August,2018Expected : Fresh Camera,Strape"
5,"Got the product delivered in two days, though the app at the time of ordering showed a one day delivery. The packaging was a big disappointment. The expensive product was placed in an Amazon polythene bag. I have purchased toys for a few hundred rupees which have been placed in large boxes with adequate cushioning, but this one was pretty scary. The DSLR original box had some dents and small tears probably due to handling.The pricing of the product was quite attractive during the amazon sale period. Same price on other etailers as well, went with Amazon as my experience has been far superior here. The seller was Appario. Checked the price with offline shops, was expensive by about 7k compared to online price.All items as mentioned in the website was found. A bag (not too great), a 16gb card pasted on top of the polythene cover and the big box with the camera and lenses. There was some bubble sheet wrap inside the DSLR box to cover the lens and the body. Hope in future Amazon does take care to pack expensive and delicate items properly.Items in the DSLR box - the body, the two lenses 18-55 and 70-300, a strap, battery, a charger, required paperwork, the rubber eyecup, (there was no CD in the box)The product needs very little explanation. The two lenses will do its job, setting it up was a breeze, though the SnapBridge App took some learning, especially the wifi to connect to a smart phone. Several features that are handy. The battery had just enough charge out of the box to click a few quick pictures (attached with the review).For a beginner, there is a learning curve, need to learn a few technicalities. Lots of practice before a good picture can be shot. Endless possibilities, probably another lens 50mm f/1.8 may be required at a later stage for close up portraits.Honestly found the price to be quite attractive when compared to the earlier DSLR models also on sale from Nikon and  Canon, went in with this model after checking with a few professional photographers. Worth every paisa spent. Definitely recommeded, that too at the sale price.Would have docked a star for the poor packaging, but the joy of using the product prevented me from doing it. Maybe will update this review after mastering the camera."
1,Defective charger sent.. otherwise good camera...
5,This is the best dslr for beginners under 45k (with 2 lens 18-55  & 70-300mm ) also received a good quality bag and 16 gb memory card free from Appario reatailPROSPicture quality is superiorAutofocus works amazingly good with 39 af pointsArticulated touch screen is pretty useful while shooting videosGood gripVarious connectivity option and of course sapbridge photo transfer works very wellCONSVideo shooting is not up to the mark .You will have to buy a prime lens if you want more bokeh effect.Overall bang for bucks.
5,"Excellent camera Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also."
1,The battery is not working within 2 months of purchase. When we escalate it they are asking us to go with paid service. What for we are going with Amazon. Very poor service by amazon I am totally disappointed..My suggestion is don't buy any electronic products from Amazon..
4,"I'm using it for 4 months. If  light condition is good then picture clarity amazing. Especially 700mm lense. However, most of time picture quality is not that good. For beginners it is ok to learn and play all the settings. If yount take portraits you need another 50mm lense which cost around 12k. For Pro quality pictures you have spend double the amount on body üòâ only.Finally be patient until  you get the amount to purchase a pro camera üòÅ to not disappointed."
4,worth for money. Initially it took one-two days to get acquainted well with all settings . but after that the result were satisfactory. still to explore 60 % settings more ..  lenses have both pros and cons. if expecting highly professional outputs from these lenses  pls go for wide focus camera with premium lenses. otheriwse at this price it is prefect..
4,Terrific purchase...good for beginners...! The auto focus is awesome.. settings and other features are very easy to operateCons: the snapbridge aap that connects with smartphone is horrible most of the time it won't connect..so ultimately you have to take the pics to pc via USB or card reader and then take it to phone.. don't know if the problem is woth the app of smartphone or with the camera..!
5,"It was our first DSLR, so obviously there was confusion and apprehension but this camera is totally worth it, especially to start with. Plus it came at really good deal from Amazon making it a great  buy.I'm happy that I went with the 2 lens variant as both, 18-55mm & 70-300mm, have their roles to play for beginners.Just one concern, the bag provided with this variant is not as good as it is with the single lens variant."
1,"Doesn‚Äôt seem to be originalAfter about 20 pages print outs are coming out blank , i got a bad cartridge and rs 6500/- wastedDon‚Äôt recommend this seller"
4,Good product . I used for Canon MF633Cdw. It is working well.
4,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm‚Äôs entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it‚Äôs hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There‚Äôs a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there‚Äôs a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there‚Äôs a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.Cons:- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don‚Äôt feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.- At such a high price point Fujifilm should‚Äôve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.In case you‚Äôve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews."
3,"Seller: Appario RetailPrice: 58990\-Delivery: 2 days, Prime, BangalorePackage: Came in box pack, covering contentsReturnable: NO, 10 days replacement, but that too subject to Amazon terms!Note, only replacement if faulty is proved to customer care. If they are not convinced, you have to service it at service point only!. Better to buy locally if possible after thorough testing.Biggest disappointment is price dropped almost 9K after I bought. It hit the lowest 49990/-, after I bought it. Very much disappointed!!!Box contains Camera, Lens kit, Bag, Basic manual, USB type C cable for charge, Battery and 16GB SDHC class-10No Battery charger unit provided.Things to know:~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Charging through USB cable via 2A adapter takes 2-3 hrs>>  Display is 3.5inch, articulated, huge and sharpest among any other camera even a segment above>>  Viewfinder is electronic, supports pictures and video preview as well, but some lag is noticeable, can't replace an optical viewfinder smoothness>>  Rated 275 shots in high quality, not tested>>  3-4 buttons and dials can be customizable, including some parts of touchscreen>>  Supports HDR caped at 1080p 25fps only, Gimbal mode caped at 1080p 30fps only!>>  Supports 4K 30fps only, HDR or gimbal mode are not supported at 4K video>>  Touch screen is not as 100% touch capable as smart phone. Mix of buttons is required!>> Somewhat slower compared to DSLR shooting speedFuji XT200 or Canon M50 or Sony 6100?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the budget range of 40-60K, Canon M50 poses a tough competition. Sony is only good for auto-focus, rest is simply similar to others but they charge so much for the same. To decide between Canon M50 and XT200,>>  M50 has 4K crop factor and a big downside in 2020>>  M50 is 2 years old, XT200 is 6 months old>>  XT200 LCD is sharper, bigger and vivid>>  Gimbal mode and HDR supported in XT200, but only on 1080p>>  XT200 supports 120FPS 1080p slow motion, which is very good out of the box>>  425 Focus points in XT200 against 143 in M50>>  No USB charging in M50>> vM50 uses USB 2.0 while XT200 uses USB 3.0>>  Fuji lens are cheaper and expansion is easy>>  Picture quality and video quality is much better than mobile shooting (iPhone, S10, etc)Picture wise, there shouldn't be much difference, but there are lots of reason to get XT200 than M50, esp for those who prefer videos. Fuji XA7 is a low cost model, sold here at Amazon for ~39K. It has no viewfinder and lacks HDR, Gimbal mode, slow motion, etc.Disappointments:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Camera price dropped sharply>>  Gets warmer soon (which seems normal)>>  Some live filters and editing features you can apply but seems more like gimmick like smart phones these days>>  Picture quality is good unless you start to zoom beyond 2x>>  Auto-focusing isn't faster in picture or video capture, Sony is better>> Stock LENS IS A JOKE & VERY AVERAGE!!!..Fuji a disappointmentIf you looking for upgrade over mobile shooting and considering ease of use, prefer this mirrorless cameras. If you still want to learn and earn, you can buy a good midrange DSLR for this price and still take amazing pics!Hope this helps"
4,"TLDR;Brilliant picture quality. Long term ownership might be expensive but worth the money.Unless you have specific requirement for higher FPS (240fps), weatherproof sealing, battery grip, full frame sensor etc, this camera manages to do it all.Handles all light situations really well and the inbuilt film simulation will keep you busy with your shots for a long time and the jpeg output along with raw are great from the camera itself. While the camera is a joy to use.The film simulation outputs both picture and video are so good natively on the camera your post processing time is reduced significantly.It's very lightweight, equivalent of less than 2 smartphones in your hand, makes for an easy carry, I could fit this camera with a 35mm lens within my jacket. It's not weatherproof.Body is metal + plastic but never feels shabby it's built solid, it fits on the hand well and the 360 degree rotatable screen is a blessing with its 16:9 aspect ratio, no other camera has such good back lcd and EVF screen. LCD viewable under sunlight too.The standard fuji layout helps take care of ISO, Aperture and shutter speed with manual dials which is way better than using the touchscreen.you can change all of this with just a finger and thumb, along with a lightweight body and that brilliant lcd this makes using this camera a breeze, it doesn't restrict you in any way Framing the shot. The UI is standard and quick, also extra function buttons and dials are configurable to various settings.The smartphone app for this camera has imporved a lot but leaves much to be wanted from it.it gets the job done but that's about it sharing files and Remote shutter for long exposure ..yes, availableYou get free capture one pro software but that will be camera locked license which will work with only Fujifilm RAW images for free. It has its learning curve but outputs were better or on par with Lightroom TBH.Sensor is new as of 2020, found no issues with low light performance as well, This also picks up fainter red light better than canon or nikon if you are intrested in astrophotography. This DOES NOT have the xtrans sensor on it.Fuji lenses are expensive. There are cheaper XC lenses to go with your kit lens making 3 lenses to cover 14-230mm within 80k budget along with this camera and are definitely better than the kit lens from other brands, all pics are from a budget 35mm F2 lens and I am not a pro.The XF series lens are expensive but are a different category.. similar to canon L series lenses and good luck finding them in used market in india. It's impossible. You won't have anyone to share lenses with as well.You would be buying the lens and accesories mostly new and have a very hard time renting any Fujifilm lens in india. Accesories are expensive and limited in options compared to canon/nikon but the camera makes up for it in its ease of use and ready to use picture quality. Long term ownership cost will be higher with this camera, but will be worth every money spent.Given higher overall cost, limited option for third party accesories and unavailability of used lenses I would still purchase this camera again if I lost my present one. The camera is easy to use and pictures are that good. I am limited by my own skill as of the moment, as long as you know what you are doing the camera cleanly follows through.Get the higher end XT3 if you are into sports photography and need a weatherproof body along with IBIS and higher frame rate video.Attached images are all from camera with minimal adjustment in snapseed.More on instagram@cygnopia"
5,"To begin with camera looks i will give 5/5. Retro look with premium finish.Light weight with good colour options to choose.Looking for a dslr entry level camera but couldn't find one,you can go for fuji mirrorless.15-45 mm lens work fine and potrait mode is excellent for candid photography.Value for money i must say"
5,"Great entry level camera to learn photography. Wanted to buy Sony Alpha but due to the global unavailability  in India had to look for alternatives. Out of other cameras I finally settled with Fuji X-T200 due to the Value for money comparison. 50K is a great deal for this camera.Fact - I had lens related issues on my first camera and for which I registered a replacement request. Hassle free experience and got a replacement camera working  as expected in 2 days. Kudos to Amazon and seller.In the box - Camera, lens(based on option selected), usb-c cable, Usb-c headphone connector, neck band, Leather shoulder bag, 16gb memory card, battery NP-W126sAfter almost using a week here's detailed review:CONS -1) Battery life (replacement batteries are available and along you can use dummy battery to use AC current)2) 4k Video - Auto Focus not good compare to Sony Alpha 6100/64003) Video shooting is limited to 15mins only.4) 15-45 kit lens is average. You will not notice unless use it professionallyPROS1) Value for Money2) Webcam function - WFH3) Articulating display is amazing4) External Headphone jack5) Photos can be transferred to mobile phone via Wi-fi (Videos can not be)Overall, buy extra set of batteries  and enjoy this camera to start your photography journey."
5,"Best camera in 50k range.:- It's Mirrorless, compact and lightweight:- Has more focus point than canon m50 II:- Using it's app your can use the live camera on :-mobile and other interesting features.:-It has all the latest features.:-It comes with whole kit - memory card, bag,etc.So, in the end it all comes down to your knowledge and experience to use the settings of the camera in the best possible way."
5,Fantastic image quality and sensor for its price. I love the classic fuji images color science. I've also purchased the xc 50-230 mm lens and the results are very pleasing. Very much recommended.Cons - the mobile app and pairing simy DOES NOT work
5,"This camera is the best in this range. Other competitors of this camera are the M50 and a6100. If you want a camera for shooting photos then this is the one you should choose. For photos, it is far better. Picture quality is awesome and can use Fuji simulation.For videos, it does provide 4K but the shooting limit is 15 mins. If you want to create small clips then you can choose this one.Autofocus is also good in this camera but Sony and Canon are better in autofocus.I compared this cam with the other competitors in this range and found this one more value of money. If in future you want to upgrade then Fuji has awesome range of camera and you can use these lens on other camera as well. Fuji has same mount(X) for all cameras.Fuji has wide variety of lenses and are not costly compared to Sony and Canon.Tip: Purchase XC 35 F2 lens once you are done exploring the kit lens. This lens is cheap(around 15K) and gives you a wide aperture to shoot blur backgrounds."
5,"Bought the Fuji XT200 mirrorless camera with stock 15-45 Fuji lens to replace a Nikon D3200.Sturdy build with good sturdy feel to all buttons and access door flaps. Great images as shared.Easy to learn and use menu. Loads of helpful expert videos about learning to use this model found online.Reasonably good battery life but as with all mirrorless cameras, suggest having a spare battery or be prepared to recharge if expecting heavy use of greater than 500-600 snaps.Battery life can be improved by using Electronic view finder instead of LCD screen for framing while taking pictures. Some very helpful menu features available.Very happy with the purchase so far.Was initially upset with the wonky looking packing the kit came in, even though it was securely sealed.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the wonky package was due to a free and very good complimentary camera bagüíìüòäüëç. Thanks to the vendor for the thoughtful gesture and prompt delivery in time for my holiday üòäüëçOverall, very happy with the camera, the vendor and delivery. 5 stars all the way."
5,"If you know to use a camera, it is plug and play. Auto mode is great. If you are new to cameras, like me, it takes some learning to know the huge list of features it can offer but it'll grow in you.Basic manual is provided and owner's manual can be downloaded. The app does the basic job. I don't have any experience with other cameras so, can't comment about the app in comparison. It's worth the money"
5,"Absolutely worth every penny. It is small, easy to hold. Comes with a touch-enabled rotatable LCD screen. Battery life could have been better, but no other peeves.Note:You get a 16 GB SDHC memory card with the camera; I would suggest buying an SDXC 128 GB with the camera."
5,Awesome camera. capturing very good quality image. Image is very sharp. 4K video quality is also perfect.  Battery life is bit low. Display is crisp and bright. Don't think otherwise go with this camera.. u will never regret after purchase.
1,"I got a product with an open box packing which was plastered. The product seemed okay inside but on close inspection I could find the country of origin of camera is Indonesia and the lens was from Philippines, while I was of the impression that the product would be from the Fuji‚Äôs legacy factories in Japan. It‚Äôs dubious Amazon doesn‚Äôt give the country of origin for their products sold in the platform, giving the sellers the opportunity to cheat people by selling a low end product desguised as the original factory claimed. It‚Äôs worthwhile to note that flip kart and tatacliq specify the make factory and country clearly on their website. I got the product not of my colour choice, that I could get a refund. But even if I came to know the product they delivered is from another country not expected, I think I would‚Äôve got a refund if they delivered the right choice of color for me. So beware and ensure the product comes from Japan itself before you buy it. At the time of writing, I had a better offer from tatacliq and they give the product originally from Fuji Japan factory...note that my seller here was Price..Perfect"
5,Nice Product
5,Very good choice compared to other cameras in mirrorless category..Box includes1. camera + lens2. 16 GB memory card3. Beautiful camera bagPoora paisa wasool.Great features at affordable price
5,"Don‚Äôt take pictures in jpg, use raw for better image and quality, don‚Äôt know why fuji jpg was not good in xt200 with human skin, reds poping thats the only problem at all"
3,Availability of lens is very big issue
5,Picture quality is superb kit lens is desent enough for the beginners who just shifted from mobile to camera day light performance is awesome suffers a bit in low light performance but overall its good you can go with this loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Picture quality is below average,won't feel it's a 50K camera,but a low priced point and shoot camera,not much easy to use with all settings. Feels not good on picture quality.other than this it's okay"
5,Great Purchase.
5,For college course use
5,"my first camera , excited and super happy with the purchasetook just 4 pics and believe me i am super satisfied with it"
4,"The grip is uncomfortable, the camera itself is really good for beginners. Battery life is not great, decent enough"
5,Very very nice
5,Very Good Product....U will Be loving it and have ur memories with good Quality
5,"Since most of the reviews revolve around comparing this to a DSLR, I guess my take on it comes from a size perspective. You also have this sony alpha mirror less camera here  but its too expensive currently.I cannot take a DSLR hiking, they're simply too bulky and too heavy to justify the space in my pack. When I looked at replacing my Canon, I went out to find something that I could get that was lightweight without sacrificing the quality of the images I had grown used to with the DSLR. This had an aesthetic I really liked and the features I was looking for as well. It doesn't look like a cheap point and shoot with a bigger lens strapped to the front. The controls are perfectly fine for me and are more second nature since I've spent a lot of time behind it. Like anything new one gets, you have to get used to it. I find the colors on pictures I take with this camera come out much better overall compared to my old Canon. It isn't excessively difficult to use, and I don't find the menu cluttered at all. The camera is very light and very small for what performance you can squeeze out of it, its footprint is about the same as my Samsung Galaxy s10e. The camera is mostly just wider with the lens mounted.I cannot attest to the video features as I do not use them.My only gripes about this camera are the kit lens and the materials, mostly the kit lens, and those are never really spectacular anyways. It just seems to be adequate for most circumstances, without ever being the ""perfect"" choice for a scene. Its easily replaced however, so you can learn on it before getting a new lens better suited to your tastes. That lightweight I enjoy comes at the cost of the materials unfortunately. The camera is VERY plastic-y and does not feel like it would survive a fall. I don't drop my cameras, but I'm not sure my old DSLR would have survived either. Better materials and weatherproofing would have meant a higher cost anyways, and that would've defeated the purpose of this for me.All in all, I find this camera perfectly suited for what I needed. I needed a lightweight, high image quality camera, and the Fujifilm XT200 got me there. Your mileage may vary though depending on your skill level, experience with much more expensive cameras, and overall attitude."
4,"The Fujifilm X-T200 is an inexpensive mirrorless camera that uses the company's X-mount. It replaces the X-T100, a camera that seemed promising when it was announced, but whose sluggish performance was a letdown. Thankfully, Fujifilm has put a lot of work into making the X-T200 both more responsive and full-featured.Key specifications:24MP APS-C sensor with Bayer color filter and faster readout speedsUpdated hybrid autofocus system with 425 phase-detect pointsRefined ergonomics, lighter body3.5"", 16:9 fully articulating LCD with 2.76 million dotsEasy-to-use touch menus2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder with 0.62x magnification8 fps burst shootingNew 'Clarity' effectOversampled 4K video with no cropAudio level controlsMicrophone and headphone inputs (latter via USB-C adapter)New Digital Gimbal and HDR video options.conclusionThe Fujifilm X-T200 is quite a bit different than its predecessor, the X-T100. While the X-T100 tried to be a scaled down version of the X-T20, Fujifilm failed to pull it off, for a variety of reasons.The X-T200 tries to be a scaled down X-T30 and more. It's a camera that should suit both amateurs who want a lot of physical controls, and smartphone upgraders who like the familiarity of touchscreen operation. And this time, Fujifilm has succeeded.From most angles, the X-T200 looks like many other Fujifilm X-series cameras, like the X-T30 and X-T3/X-T4. It has a DSLR-style body, plenty of dials on the top (though, thankfully, not as many as higher-end models) and an electronic viewfinder. What makes the X-T200 stand out from the more expensive cameras is its gigantic and bright fully articulating 3.5"" touchscreen."
5,"Here are a few things to note before you make a decision1. This is a nice option for anyone looking to get better pictures and videos compared to your Smartphone, especially if you are a content creator2. Don't get discouraged by the 15 min limit for 4K videos, because unless you are creating videos for commercial purposes, full HD resolution is way more than sufficient. Now, if you do need 4K, 15min is quite a bit for one shot.3. The XC kit lens provided is not the best option to get the most out of this camera. Considering upgrading to the significantly better XF 18-55F2.8-4 or a fast prime lens (16/23/35 - depending on your needs).4. If you are willing to spend another 30k, the X-T30 comes with the kit 18-55 option, but you will not get a fully articulating, screen which may be a deal-breaker.At this price point, you will no go wrong with the T200!Best all-round prime lens (subjective): Fuji 23mmF2 or Tokina 23mmF1.4 (just released)An alternative, comparable camera at this price point: Sony A6100An alternative option if you are only looking at casual photography: iPhone 11Do check out my other reviews on YT (Home Savvy Tech). I will be reviewing a Fuji camera in the near future."
5,"This is an absolutely amazing camera , for this price and this size it certainly exceeds expectations..The interface can take some getting used to, but once you are familiar it's a delight.With a good prime lens, it takes unbelievable pictures. Way better than counterparts from canon and nikon like m50 and z series.Also the battery life is not so great, go for extra batteries + charger for a better experience.I'm an absolute beginner even from a hobbyist perspective but the shots I've attached are all first trys with a 25mm prime lens.."
5,"Go for it, it's better than Canon m50 and Sony a6100. And cheaper too!Picture quality is excellent, you won't regret it. Surprisingly I absolutely love the film simulations, Classic Chrome is my favourite!To mkae your kit complete, you can buy the following:1. XC 35mm f22. XC 50-230mmThese two lens along with your kit lens will give you all you need to take your photography to nwxt level."
2,"I bought this camera, but now I'm refunding it because of images quality is very poor, Everything in the camera is good.  4K video, eyes focus is good but its image quality with this lens is not good.  Better lens should be provided with this camera because price is also too High, according to the money, its image quality is very bad."
4,"I bought this camera from offline market. Becoz i was not flexible on spendig such a huge amount thats too in advance. And one more thing one of my friend purchased this camera from here and he received a water bottle and a cheap quality bag. So guys Just check everything before u buy or go for offline options , becoz u might get cheated.."
1,"Picture size 5.00 mb maximum. It gets heat after 30 mins of use. Battery lofe 1 hour.If you zoom image and video quality gets down,In video follow focus dont work properly,Not for video and not for photo.Please don't buy. Compny is a cheater. Images get so much of noise."
1,Waste of every penny you invest even get it for free don't go for it no service no quality .I got it complaint on day one of purchase itself and its been seven months no response from company in short I can tell you one thing if you don't know how to waste your money and time this is the best product to deal with
5,Easy to use.Great LCD screen & it is very responsive.Helpful preset modes.Indian version includes a Memory card + Bag (bag is lame though)
5,"Yes, using it with insta 360 invisible selfie stick since a month with no issues.Its a good product, Heavy enough to hold the weight of Stick and Camera when used as a monopod (Tripod base).Some say it has poor plastic base that shakes, In fact it is the advantage that absorbs minor shakes of wind or accidental touch and provide flexibility to the assembly as a strong but flexible base.For use as Bullet time rotation handle its good, but I feel you will never or very rarely use this feature.So, practically, good one, must have to complete your kit. Go for it without any doubt."
5,"The bullet functions very well, but the tripod is not steady if stick is extended.  Not at all for outdoor use as a little bot of breeze can make your camera trip over."
1,Waste product
3,"Pro: based on what I received, have good clear image.Cons: Product description page have brand GOR. I received brand BUSHNELL; That's still okay. But product description page said the binocular is 20 x 50. The one I received was 10 x 50. I ordered it to gift it to someone. Since I didn't have time to return and wait for replacement, I'm keeping it.It it was described as Bushnell 10 x 50 in the product description, I would have rated it 4*."
5,Too good to be true!I Received the binocular as per the images and description on Amazon.It's 7x Magnification and 50 mm Objective lens covers above 800 meters to 1 km. If the object is large it will cover above 1 km.The clarity and focusing is top notch for this price range.It comes in other brand I guess China make. But the really good as per the quality taken into consideration.Go for it if you are looking for a below 2400/- rupees binocular.
5,Picture quality is amazing. I must say best quality binocular for bird watching at this Price range. Sturdy binocular couldn't have asked for anything better.

2,"In my point of view this product seems bit over priced, spending Rs.399 for really expensive DSLR's protection is not a big deal, but when you pay Rs.399 you should feel it's value for money and it's quality. Also there is no ""dust removal tape"" i had no time to search this in market place that's why opted to buy online, Rs.399 is MRP of this screen guard, i guarantee you, you will get the same thing for less than MRP price.Anyway now got protection for display.Thanks to Amazon."
4,Dont confuse it with tamper glass. It is meant to protect the screen against dust and scratches only.- Ultra thin film.- Fits perfectly onto the screen.- Bit over priced IMO.
5,Excellent qualityTouchscreen works totally fineScratch resistantUsing it continuously for the last 2yrs without changeGood product at a reasonable price
3,Fits perfectly on Nikon D5600. Quality is good but expensive. Could have provided protective peel on both sides of the screen guard. Looks nice and didn't feel any change in the touch screen sensitivity.
1,Today I received  a damage product
2,It's only flexible plastic coted screen guard...
3,Very useful..
3,"The size of the guard is accurate and fits the camera perfectly. But the size of the guard is very thin and is too costly compared to it. I was surprised to see a cleaning cloth inside which was of good quality and of high assistance. Overall, great product, average quality and a bit costly."

5,"if you are seeing this than either you are looking for taking pictures or making daily vlogs or may be for any other reason.let me tell you guys i choose this after 1 month of intensive research .This model is sony rx-100 mark 3 but you can also get sony rx-100 mark 4 and mark 5 ,little bit of differences and cost increases as model number increases.i choose this one as my budget was below 50K and yes there are other options as well like CANON g7x mark 2 and i would say that one is  best model for vlogging and taking pictures BUT SONY MARK 3 has some advantages over canon g7x mark 2 as well.this model is very small,you can keep into your pocket and even you hold it in your hand for hours you wont feel any tired ness.lets talk about what i got in PACKAGE.- Main camera- charger adapter and wire- FREE POUCH to keep camera- 8 GB FREE memory cardas there was nothing written while purchasing but YES you will get free cover and memory card so hurayyythis camera hasNO TOUCHSCREENthis camera hasFLIP OUT SCREENthis comes under point and shoot category.if you thinking to buy this for daily pictures,or youtube videos just go with it.this is the best pocket friendly,tiniest in this price segment camera deliver by sony.dont think i am sony fan,only thing is canon g7x mark 2 was unavailable and this was the second best choice.moreover if you see my other reviews i have been USING CANON DSLR 80D as well.so this was my honest review as i got this for vlogging mainly and taking some sharp real (not over saturated ) landscape pictures.Hope this helpedThank you for readingstay fit stay strong"
5,"Great camera. Go for it instead of an entry level DSLR. I switched from canon 550d and am not going back. Awesome for all my travel and family photos. Controls are a bit difficult because of small size and sony software is irritating otherwise a great cam.Also buy a couple of spare batteries. Battery life not comparable to DSLR.Best feature- Great sharp lens, DRO, good autofocus, 24mm at widest, selfie capable, low light performance, silent, size, movie mode is nearly like a camcorderCon- battery, sometimes confusing controls, sony software, frnds with DSLR underestimate it"
5,"I understand that in this price of one camera you will get two entry level DSLR. But trust me, the quality of pictures coming out of this is nothing less than a intermediate level DSLR. You can't even complain... And it comes in a small size that fits in your pocket. I only bought this camera for its portability. I used it on my honeymoon and got very good pictures. Didn't even have the hassle of carrying special bag for this. And I don't know half of the functions. Even in auto mode this works like a charm. I was willing to spend more for portability. I don't regret my decision at all!!"
5,"Everything about this camera is great. Light weight, pocket friendly and powerful. Only issue is that the bag provided was not for this camera. It doesn't fit at all.Battery backup is good too, more than happy about it. Pictures quality is mind blowing,low light performance is impressive, noise reduction, auto focus is the best for a camera of this size and the price."
4,"If you are a beginner and don't have money to spend on your DSLR lenses , just close your eyes and order it!Once you learn to shoot photos with it in manual mode , you can shift to DSLRs like a6400 with a gmaster f4 24 135mm lens."
3,"Need to do a Phd in tuning this camera with so many options without which pictures in all weather conditions will not come up properly, need a solid a training to use this camera, sometimes the pictures are so whitish in cloudy condition in manual mode without any settings changes it is hard to take good pictures and you will be spending so much time experimenting for a good shot"
5,"I have been using Sony RX100 mark 3 since 6 months and it satisfies me every time,Camera is easily pocketable, easy to carry around.whenever I shoot with it, It gives me awesome quality images.And the amazing thing camera can shoot full manual with even manual focussing and all customisable to shortcut keys."
5,Very good product but high on price. The quality of still and video is very good as a normal user. The thing I miss is touch screen which will be useful for tap to focus. This feature is really missing which is available in cannon.
5,An excellent camera with a great lens ‚Ä¶ great for shallow depth of field and on low light‚Ä¶
5,Wannt a pocket size camera with dslr like quality go for it.i also got a camera pouch and 16 gb sd card with it.
4,This is a great point and shoot camera if one doesn‚Äôt want to compare with dSLRs or slightly bigger compact like Sony‚Äôs DSC bridge like HX400V
3,Wasn‚Äôt working when unpacked. We weren‚Äôt in town so couldn‚Äôt return. Later Sony refused to replace it. So now we have a repaired camera for the price of a new one.
4,Not value for money
5,Simply superb....This tiny and compact camera is greater than bulky basic DSLR cameras model. Don't hesitate...Just go for it... I have added some photos taken by this camera...
5,WiFi enabled supports NFC ... Picture clarity is damn good .. easy to carry ... But very delicate at the same time. Price can be little bit less ..
2,"Love the cam. It is compact, has so many functions, havent even able to understand them all. But unfortunately, there was no hdmi cable inside"
4,After all its a Sony product.  But this product will not replace DSLR.
5,"Compact, fast and has Raw files saving option as well. A value for money. Street photographer's handy camera. A must buy."
4,"Ad:pocket camera, easy to travel with it.disAd:Not easy to operate like mobile phone camera."
5,Took the photo without any light inside the Church. Eventhough quality of the picture is good.
5,Stood to my expectations... Really a great purchase üëç
5,"Excellent camera, no match in point & shoot but pricey."
5,Even in the year 2019 it is a 'state of the art piece of machine'. Exceptionally good camera.
4,Good but not best from DSLR
5,Most efficient
5,"Awesome ...., good camera it gives Good result."
5,Excellent lens.
5,Lovely camera. Every bit what it was described to be. üôÇ
1,Bad quality
5,The best advanced compacts out there!
5,Compact camera which takes decent photographs.
5,"The professional reviews have covered every possible way to complement this camera, so I'll only say this: if you can afford it, you should buy it. Period."
5,"It has a steep learning curve if you want to control your shots manually, otherwise you can stay in intelligent Auto and intelligent Auto+ modes, which will serve you pretty nicely. Either manual or auto, the camera is super enjoyable. The only feature I kept wanting in the camera is touchscreen, which you get on its competitor Canon G7X Mark 2. While capturing subjects with varying distance from camera, I frequently had to use manual focus to control the subject I wanted to focus on. This would have been made very easy with touch to focus to slightly assist in manual focus. Otherwise the camera is full of features, some of which I keep forgetting even after more than 6 months of use. Features I cannot live without: manual focus, A, S and P modes, track focus on moving object, optical zoom, exposure compensation, exposure lock, shooting modes, auto HDR. I can never go back to smartphone camera after using this.Thank you Sony and Amazon."
5,"I have a nikon DSLR camera but was finding it difficult to carry around during family trips. I wanted to buy a  compact point and shoot camera which shoots good quality pictures. Researched and found out that sony Rx 100 range are the best especially if you are in india as panasonic tz 100 series are not avaliable in india and leica cameras though launched recently are very expensive. I wanted to buy M2 as it has back illuminated sensor for better low light photoghrahy and wifi enabled to transfer photos to phone wirelessly. At the last moment, bought M3 as i got good deal and it has 180 degrees tiliting LCD screen for selfies and a wide 24mm lens for better landscapes. Also the electronic viewfinder is great toy if you like gadgets though i m not using it much.Picture quality is very good, comparable to DSLR and low light photography is ok. The photos posted were taken in poor lighting conditions but the camera did well. Its small and can be kept in pocket. It takes time to getting used to sony menu. Overall happy. Go for it. If budget no problem, go for higher versions."
5,A must have! I was looking for a compact and easy to carry camera than carrying my Nikon dslr and this fits all the requirement. Wish only it had the mic port as I vlog quite often.
4,"This camera is a beast in its own ways. I was never a fan of bulky cameras which we need to carry as a separate luggage everywhere we go. Then I saw this camera which offers decent capabilities on par with a DSLR. It can fit in a pocket and that is the most appalling factor to me. It has a rotatable screen with Carl Zeiss lens which is helpful to take high resolution selfies. It comes with a decent 8GB inbuilt memory and has WiFi based transfer of images to Mobile for instant upload. Flash is very good and covers a decent area. There are separate modes for varying light. If we know what mode to use in which background, then its a pretty good weapon in your hand.The cost is a flip side. Priced at 54990, I don't think the cost is justified for it. Though I bough this at 45990 in an Amazon sale, I feel 35000 is a decent price for this model."
4,"Although it has a tiltable viewfinder, making it convenient for vlogging or taking selfies, I have to state that there is distortion. It is not so apparent when you take images/ video of objects, but when you are capturing faces, there is something different.. In my case, it made my face look more oval than it is. Then I went ahead and took a picture of my toddler and his face looked leaner in the pictures too. I did try out various angles to find the best one that flattered my features, but I don't think this camera's strength is meant for such beauty vlogging. It is great, however, for general vlogging when the aoi is not just the face. The quality is crisp and i love how amazing it is in low light as well. The colours and true to the original mostly and there are tonnes of options in the camera to a la carte your settings. I had all my hopes pinned to the Zeiss lens which i would rank 95/100 on this camera. I have had Carl Zeiss lens on my mobile, and together with its algorithm gave picture quality that is till date unbeatable. Unfortunately they dont make that phone anymore. The audio function in this camera is also good. You dont need a separate mic. That said, it picks up the audio nearby and around it, unlike my canon t3i which picks up sounds even from the road adjacent to our house making the video annoyingly noisy. That was not desirable in my videos, so I am content with the Sony's. As always, the sony battery is not its forte, and it takes a long time to fully recharge the battery with the provided adapter. It came with a complimentary (?) 8 GB SD card. It also came with a camera pouch the material of which is flimsier than the grocery bad that my local departmental store provides. It is a paper-cotton blend, and  poor enough to wipe glasses let alone carry a precious camera like this one."
5,"I already own a dslr but like to have a compact camera as well, for casual days when I don't want to lug around something too bulky. I owned the Fujifilm X100 & thought I would upgrade to the X100T itself until I came to know about the Sony RX100 series.It is a brilliant compact camera, wide a wide aperture lens. The flip screen is indispensable for me as I vlog & need to see that the framing is ok. Although I don't use flash, I'm amazed at how sleek the flash is on this & yes I fully admit to showing it off to people who marvelled over this camera. The Electronic Viewfinder too is just something else! But the best thing of all is just how tiny it is, it fits even into my smallest clutches without any problem. Built in bluetooth means I can fire up the application on my phone & transfer photos within minutes if I want to instagram. In some situations like low light even the best phone camera just doesn't cut it.This is a superb camera - not the cheapest but absolutely worth it. I've had this since October 2014, so 9 months as of writing this review & I absolutely love it. If I had to pick one flaw, I wish this had a hotshoe or mic output, that's one thing that's missing for me. Nonetheless I'd throughly recommend it!"
5,"the best pocket camera got bested in Mark III avatar, just awesome picture quality, much better than entry level DSLR, a genuine pocket rocket."
5,Sony DSC-RX100M3 is a great pocket camera but at 43k it's overpriced. Searched in the showroom and got at 36k only.
5,It has nice zoom function with Z50 Camera.Better to purchase combo lenses with camera which will be much cheaper.
3,"I dont like it,  first day they used second day they throwed,  waste of money"
5,"This is easy to use and Value for money , when I saw it I bought it without having a second thought and when I unboxed it it was better than expected.Good product for kids....."
5,Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
4,"Item quality is fine. yes, it works. the quality of white diffuser cloth at the front is really good.The quality of diffusion is good, but nothing close to the bounce flash. Bounce flash from the ceiling is the best diffusion.Instead of ending up with hard light from a direct flash, this can resolve our problem to some extent.For the price and out put, it's worth. I feel that 15x17cm size is small, so it can work only for half portrait or head shots. Not for the full body.if will be great, if this is made slightly little bigger.It will be good, if any of you have an idea to make your own home made DIY diffuser of this kind. Make bigger size when u make.or buy this check out how it is made and try to recreate a similar one of bigger size. That's what running in mind right now."
4,Nice Product. Smaller than i expected but the quality is great. Worth buying it.
4,Its good will serve the purpose I was checking youtube videos and was actually hoping this is little big and yes it is a little big which means its better than the plastic dome diffusers and other bounce diffusers. The best part the portraits are amazing using a little less strong flash but direct angle light. 4 star because I personally feek if locally produced with the same quality the price shud not be more than 100 150 bucks. Ghe prices shud reduce actually.UpdateDid a shoot today indoor and outdoor it just rocks. Direct full force flash diffusers brilliantly no shadow and perfect white background. Buy it without a thought
5,I was little skeptical while ordering this product since i thought in such less proce it won‚Äôt be of such good quality. But i was wrong. The product i received was of really good quality. Moreover since i‚Äôm a photographer it is a very useful product for me. It really diffuses the harsh and direct flash light. I recently shoot for a beauty peagent audition wherein i was not ready with proper studio lights. So this was a real saviour. I definitely recommend this as a must have product with TTL flash for some urgent situations.
4,"Build Quality is awesome & Diffusion of a Subject's face is ok for the price,Light gets softer compared to RAW flash output. Good for Portraits and some small Shoots, Isn't for Professional usages."
5,Well made product. The black  box is very strong. The front diffuser white cloth is of super quality. Size is alright. The collapsibe cloth box is pocketable.  Best product even for professionals.
4,Well the quality of the product is fine and everything. But please check the dimensions of the soft box before buying it. I thought it was a full sized soft box. It's a mini soft box. Fairly small. Don't buy it if you're expecting a full sized one like me. Other than that it's a good product worth the money.
5,Good product. It is what you see it on the screen on Amazon. Material is good and looks sturdy. The design is also good. At such a price it is a steel absolutely. Good diffuser for your camera flash or you can put a LED focus lamp to create lighting effects.
5,"It comes with exact dimensions. And it also has a metal frame. It comes with shiny inside. They provided a bag also for it. If you are looking to use it for Camera, it is definitely useful. The dispenser cloth is pure white colour. (Do check images)"
5,Good Product at this price!!Good QualityHappy With product!!
2,"Okay product. Don't expect any outstanding results.Go for a light sphere instead, sphere will work great in outdoor too where there are no ceilings."
5,"Product quality ok, a bit smaller in size would have been better. The plastic diffuser provided by flashgun companies do more or less same job. Not essential unless you are planning to use flash head-on."
4,"I really liked the product, it is really helpful to get a softer light during photography.Over all the performance is really good, I liked the packing and there is a storage bag to safeguard the product."
5,This one is awesome. In Amazon the price is less than store price.
2,Doesn‚Äôt fit properly with my Canon 430 ex II flash. It slips from the head of the flush. Build quality is good but fitting system is improper. Don‚Äôt buy.
5,Good product for filter the flash light and helps to take a nice photo without bleach... good product in this price...
1,No use its waste of money. No difference in lights. Totally waste. Don't buy friends. I think they are paying and getting good feedback
5,Excellent
5,Took lots of indoor picks.Strong and useful for my photography needs.Using it for even light distribution.
5,Nice and good product
5,Very nice
5,I was wondering how they can make such a good piece for such a moderate price. Very useful to catch portraits.
4,It's totally value for money & it's light weight to carry in my camera bag... Hoping the durability is good enough
5,"Good product price point of view quality also decent, size quite small. But very useful."
4,Very handy for run and gun situation. But not meant for serious photography.
5,"Supper usefull. To control over exposure,  and get a soft lighting in the right direction."
5,Great product with carrying pouch and I would suggest to buy it only for rectangle head flash and not round head flash.
3,Build quality is good. But the diffuser cloth is too thick to pass enough light. Doesn't solve the purpose efficiently.
4,"Average product , but does it's job well, value for money. Was well packed , received in good condition"
4,"Great product, perfectly fits around the flash or a small CFL in a lamp and gives the perfect softening effect."
5,"Looks good and quality also good, I am not a professional photographer, but this is very good for my usage, anyone can consider to step down flash light or use as a diffuser."
5,I use this as a easily portable light diffuser and it works just like what I expected.
3,"Too small not of much uses, good for camera or camcoder flash only!!"
4,Good one
5,Work so gr8.... Half performance look like softbox with stand

4,Seems a good product. Only time can tell. How true it can hold up to its claim of 7√óshatter protection. And how scratch proof it can be. It was slightly big for my Sony cybershot dsc h 300 camera. About 2 mm longer. It could easily be cut with scissors. That shows its not toughened glass. It seems to be like acrylic.
4,Quality is good
5,Mice
5,"Gerat Product,"
5,"Gerat Product,"
4,"At this price i'd say it's a good Flash. I've been using it for a couple of photo sessions & here my opinion:‚çüIt's a totally Manual flash, so you have to manually adjust the power & the flash exposure compensation.‚çüBuild quality was pretty average, not something to brag about but it works & gets the job done.‚çüIt comes with a carry bag & a mini stand. And it's Made in China.‚çüThe Flash is very powerful with a Guide Number of 65 very useful for all kinds of scenarios.‚çüWorks with most Nikon & Canon DSLRs. Haven't tried it with other brands but it should work fine.‚çüIt requires 4 AA Batteries, i could get up to 200 shots at full power using 2550MAh Eneloop Pro from Panasonic. Recycle time was kinda slow but mostly under 3 seconds.‚çüIt can also be use in Optical Slave Mode that means you can trigger it using your camera pop-up or built-in flash. Very useful for a single Off-Camera Flash setup.‚çüAt low power 128/64 it gives that vignette effects which was kinda odd cause I've never seen that in a flash.‚çüIt doesn't have an Auto-Focus assist beam.Overall it's a good buy, it might not be the best but at this price i'll take it.Hope this helps."
5,"Initially, the TyFy Flash worked well but since 8th Dec, 2018, it is taking charge, display is OK but not firing. I even charged battery but not firing. I have mailed the problem to supplier on 9th morning. I am waiting for reaction/ solution from the supplier. I hope, the supplier will resolve problem or send fresh piece to my satisfaction. This is what is expected by me. My mobile no. is 8895501473."
4,"This products is good. I purchased for fill in flashed - slave. Its very sensitive,light, sufficient GN,totally manual.Con is if you fired continually batteries getting too heated and stop working. If you replaced the batteries it will start again. One set of batteries 2800 power gives you 130/135 full power flashes. I bet on it and purchased another one.I hope this twins will work for me for long time."
1,Worst Product. Expected a lot. But in the package there was used product. Unexpected from Amazon.. The screen was fully scratched.. And the seal of the package was unsealed.
5,"I like so much,I can use in  my professional camera,good result."
4,Satisfied but it doesn't gives much backup..
5,Nice product...
5,Tell me....r this flash suitable for canon 200d
1,I have complaint for this product within 10 minutes of the delivery n opening of this ring light . It is not able to stand if i hang my mobile in the holder of ring light. Stand is defective n damaged. It is so light weight dat not able to stand errect. Wastage of money .don't buy it. I have called three times for return n refund but no one is responding. VERY BAD QUALITY N RESPONSE
5,"Nice stand to keep anywhere do any videos ,making YouTube ,tik tok extra .. easily we can our cellphone or camera over the stand make videos ,and keep led lights good visible in night times.very low price ,this was the best product for this price,less in weight so u can take wherever u want and make money"
5,Sturdy and durable product. There are many light setting options which is extremely useful. This lights give perfect warm colours for faces in videos. It can be used for most of lighting purposes in video shoots. Very impressive product. Highly recommend.
5,SHYLOC Big Selife Ring light Is Awesom. I use it more than one week very good product. Brightness is superb.Mostly I use in photography its very easy. In this small price segment the Ring light Is must better than all.
5,I'm a vlogger and I keep shooting videos every now and then. I always needed a ring light for filming bright videos and this product was the best. The light is really bright and the product is quite impressive.
5,Wonderful product easy to use and really awesome. Full paisa vasool peoduct & cheap also. If you buy thia product you won't regret.
1,It is NOT 18 INCHES. It is 10 inches. Seller is unresponsive. Do not buy
1,The camera hangs up very frequently.  Problem started with 10-15 days and the return window was closed till then. Now cannot use it at all. I have no idea how to get it repaired. Please help.
5,Great product. My kids birthday wish was fulfilled. I am impressed by the picture quality outdoors. And the icing on the cake is the games function where my kid can play retro games on the camera screen itself.
5,The design of the camera is very unique and the quality of the camera is also very good it can record video and take photos to my kids love it it looks like a video camera it's an amazing product
4,Picture quality was not that good but then too its better than other kids camera i tested. Best advantage is its 3.5inch screen and selfi camera.
1,"It's like q a toy to kids, and they only sell camera. Where the camera doesn't work without SD card. So if u are planning to buy please buy the card with the camera otherwise its a waste."
5,Liked the product.  Best for kids .
1,"The first unit I received would not charge, neither could it hold the charge that it shipped with. The replacement that I received would hang and could only be reset once the battery ran out. In all, the second unit could hardly be used for a total usage time of 10-15 minutes, that too with nothing but glitches. Ended up returning that too. Do yourself a favour and avoid purchasing something to disappoint your children!"
2,The picture quality is very bad and the screen was not visible. Look wise the camera looks good but is not worth the money spent. Wouldn't recommend this product
1,"Flimsy, substandard, China market stuff"
1,Deflected piece not working colour was washed out don't buy this product I suggest
1,The camera stopped working after 2 days
4,It is good but the card once removed does not fit back in and copying into system is. Not possible if we don‚Äôt take out the card
3,"VGA type camera, just for kids use"
2,"It's worst, waste of money. I need refund. I don't want replacement of the product, I just wanna return."
1,Its stuck. Power button not working
5,The quality of a camera is good. Best for kids to learn camera . Features are also good . Color is also different. Nice buy
5,My daughter has been using this camera and the picture quality and screen brightness is amazing.very nice gift for kids
4,For the price it is good.  Photo quality is ok and video voice quality is not so good.  But for kids at this price it's good.

5,Like it's compact design. Nice one to gift to kids.
5,Its an excellent product. The kid loves it. Picture quality is good as expected. Easy to use and beautifully designed. Worth buying for kids.

5,Video Player is loading.
5,Superb quality.i was surprised to see such nice pictures from a kida camera. Very nice.
1,"Within 2 hours of using it a bit, the screen has already started to glitch and has become fainter, the images on the screen are hardly visible now. Looks really cheapüëé"
5,I read many reviews before buying it . This kids camera is really good. The picture quality and screen is good as per the price. Really a great camera for kids .
1,Absolutely NO sound quality and there is NO internal memory
5,Value for money rechargeable and very clear photos you just have to buy an SD card .
5,Liked the camera. My kids absolutely loving it and playing all day .
2,Very poor product in purchase value. Its worth not more than Rs.500/-. Picture quality is also very bad.I don't like this product.
1,Waste pls don't buy it very cheap quality  it may damage kids eyes watching that screen horrible can't even return it waste of money and time
5,Everything is working properly. Worth buying.
5,Awesome product for kids
1,Poor quality. Camera not functioning after few days of usage. Disappointed
5,Camera is too cool. Also picture quality is also good üëç
1,picture quality is pathetic.
5,"Excellent product,  good for kids."
1,Display quality is very poor. Item has stopped working after 2 hrs of use. Not recommending
5,Picture are clicked clear liked the camera.
1,"It's battery backup is really pathetic , after charging full, battery will drain in maximum 3-4 minutes"
3,"Good for Its Price. But the corners were not proper and was not easy to fit in the lens, meaning finishing was not good. I adjusted the corner a little myself to fit.  It fits canon 18-55 and 55-250 Lens"
4,Build quality is good ..It is easily fittable on lens. You can also fit extra lens guard on front of them and lens cover either one or both .However I am using lens guard directly on lens then lens hood then lens cover.By this way iy took time for me to screw up lens hood on camera lens.And little shadow of lens good can seen on picture corners at 25mm focus
5,Good quality....but improve the packing
4,"Purchased it for my canon18-55mm STM lens, having 58mm thread. This fits perfectly. Quality is good for the price.  Purpose is solved. Upto19mm zoom the hood corners appear on the photo.  You can use this hood for zoom above 20mm only. You can mount the hood reverse side also when storing in the bag to get more space."
2,Fits perfectly on 18-55mm lens but corners are cropped in image and it is affecting image border all the time when you zoom in. For 55-250mm lens it is not at all fitting. Wasted my money for this product. I suggest not to buy this.
3,"Feels like cheap plastic, but holds well. There is slightly vignetting in the widest angles of course but that's pretty obvious. Otherwise this is an average product. Buy it if you have a small budget."
5,"Good product with nice packing easy to assemble, did not affect the auto focus, value for money. Good build material"
5,Very good lens hood.It fits perfectly and is reversible also.Satisfied.
5,"Good. But last time when I purchased you have charged only Rs. 199/-, now you have taken Rs. 239/- why?"
2,"The order was placed for two different combos. But it was received as only one parcel in which UV filter was missing . Please resolve the issue as cannot remind repeatedly being a busy surgeon. Thanks. Dr SACHDEVA,"
5,Good quality.... Bigger than I expected.... Worth for price....
5,the quality of product is not best as you expected but at this rate product is best.
1,1) Not usable under 24mm lenses otherwise you can see black corners on your images!!2) threading is not good!!
3,Good
3,Not a very great product but value for money at Rs 160. Build quality is cheap but fits fine on my dslr
5,best product in this price range. Before this product i tried many hood but they all didnt fit properly. but after buying this product i stopped looking for another hood.
5,"Nice product, the colour matches with Dslr colour, good quality, easy to fit and the best thing makes my camera look much more professional. Great product, go for it."
1,Not worthy to buy. The shade is visible in the frame as the corner.
5,Good
5,Best suitable with Canon 18-55 lens
1,Not fit tight in lensAnd hood corners are coming in frame
4,Performance as expected
1,"Worst product , poor quality , useless product"

3,Good product
3,Fitting is good for Canon efs 18mm-55mm stm lens and 55mm-250mm stm lens
1,This hood was not in equrate size. It was lose for the lens and material was not good
4,Good
3,Good
4,Value for money
1,"It's not compatible with 58mm lens, doesn't fit. Material quality was also below standards."
5,Product is good
5,Great quality product.
5,Nice one good one nice to buy .. . . .. .  .  .quality is  best . In low price
4,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm‚Äôs entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it‚Äôs hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There‚Äôs a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there‚Äôs a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there‚Äôs a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.Cons:- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don‚Äôt feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.- At such a high price point Fujifilm should‚Äôve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.In case you‚Äôve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews."
3,"Seller: Appario RetailPrice: 58990\-Delivery: 2 days, Prime, BangalorePackage: Came in box pack, covering contentsReturnable: NO, 10 days replacement, but that too subject to Amazon terms!Note, only replacement if faulty is proved to customer care. If they are not convinced, you have to service it at service point only!. Better to buy locally if possible after thorough testing.Biggest disappointment is price dropped almost 9K after I bought. It hit the lowest 49990/-, after I bought it. Very much disappointed!!!Box contains Camera, Lens kit, Bag, Basic manual, USB type C cable for charge, Battery and 16GB SDHC class-10No Battery charger unit provided.Things to know:~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Charging through USB cable via 2A adapter takes 2-3 hrs>>  Display is 3.5inch, articulated, huge and sharpest among any other camera even a segment above>>  Viewfinder is electronic, supports pictures and video preview as well, but some lag is noticeable, can't replace an optical viewfinder smoothness>>  Rated 275 shots in high quality, not tested>>  3-4 buttons and dials can be customizable, including some parts of touchscreen>>  Supports HDR caped at 1080p 25fps only, Gimbal mode caped at 1080p 30fps only!>>  Supports 4K 30fps only, HDR or gimbal mode are not supported at 4K video>>  Touch screen is not as 100% touch capable as smart phone. Mix of buttons is required!>> Somewhat slower compared to DSLR shooting speedFuji XT200 or Canon M50 or Sony 6100?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the budget range of 40-60K, Canon M50 poses a tough competition. Sony is only good for auto-focus, rest is simply similar to others but they charge so much for the same. To decide between Canon M50 and XT200,>>  M50 has 4K crop factor and a big downside in 2020>>  M50 is 2 years old, XT200 is 6 months old>>  XT200 LCD is sharper, bigger and vivid>>  Gimbal mode and HDR supported in XT200, but only on 1080p>>  XT200 supports 120FPS 1080p slow motion, which is very good out of the box>>  425 Focus points in XT200 against 143 in M50>>  No USB charging in M50>> vM50 uses USB 2.0 while XT200 uses USB 3.0>>  Fuji lens are cheaper and expansion is easy>>  Picture quality and video quality is much better than mobile shooting (iPhone, S10, etc)Picture wise, there shouldn't be much difference, but there are lots of reason to get XT200 than M50, esp for those who prefer videos. Fuji XA7 is a low cost model, sold here at Amazon for ~39K. It has no viewfinder and lacks HDR, Gimbal mode, slow motion, etc.Disappointments:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Camera price dropped sharply>>  Gets warmer soon (which seems normal)>>  Some live filters and editing features you can apply but seems more like gimmick like smart phones these days>>  Picture quality is good unless you start to zoom beyond 2x>>  Auto-focusing isn't faster in picture or video capture, Sony is better>> Stock LENS IS A JOKE & VERY AVERAGE!!!..Fuji a disappointmentIf you looking for upgrade over mobile shooting and considering ease of use, prefer this mirrorless cameras. If you still want to learn and earn, you can buy a good midrange DSLR for this price and still take amazing pics!Hope this helps"
4,"TLDR;Brilliant picture quality. Long term ownership might be expensive but worth the money.Unless you have specific requirement for higher FPS (240fps), weatherproof sealing, battery grip, full frame sensor etc, this camera manages to do it all.Handles all light situations really well and the inbuilt film simulation will keep you busy with your shots for a long time and the jpeg output along with raw are great from the camera itself. While the camera is a joy to use.The film simulation outputs both picture and video are so good natively on the camera your post processing time is reduced significantly.It's very lightweight, equivalent of less than 2 smartphones in your hand, makes for an easy carry, I could fit this camera with a 35mm lens within my jacket. It's not weatherproof.Body is metal + plastic but never feels shabby it's built solid, it fits on the hand well and the 360 degree rotatable screen is a blessing with its 16:9 aspect ratio, no other camera has such good back lcd and EVF screen. LCD viewable under sunlight too.The standard fuji layout helps take care of ISO, Aperture and shutter speed with manual dials which is way better than using the touchscreen.you can change all of this with just a finger and thumb, along with a lightweight body and that brilliant lcd this makes using this camera a breeze, it doesn't restrict you in any way Framing the shot. The UI is standard and quick, also extra function buttons and dials are configurable to various settings.The smartphone app for this camera has imporved a lot but leaves much to be wanted from it.it gets the job done but that's about it sharing files and Remote shutter for long exposure ..yes, availableYou get free capture one pro software but that will be camera locked license which will work with only Fujifilm RAW images for free. It has its learning curve but outputs were better or on par with Lightroom TBH.Sensor is new as of 2020, found no issues with low light performance as well, This also picks up fainter red light better than canon or nikon if you are intrested in astrophotography. This DOES NOT have the xtrans sensor on it.Fuji lenses are expensive. There are cheaper XC lenses to go with your kit lens making 3 lenses to cover 14-230mm within 80k budget along with this camera and are definitely better than the kit lens from other brands, all pics are from a budget 35mm F2 lens and I am not a pro.The XF series lens are expensive but are a different category.. similar to canon L series lenses and good luck finding them in used market in india. It's impossible. You won't have anyone to share lenses with as well.You would be buying the lens and accesories mostly new and have a very hard time renting any Fujifilm lens in india. Accesories are expensive and limited in options compared to canon/nikon but the camera makes up for it in its ease of use and ready to use picture quality. Long term ownership cost will be higher with this camera, but will be worth every money spent.Given higher overall cost, limited option for third party accesories and unavailability of used lenses I would still purchase this camera again if I lost my present one. The camera is easy to use and pictures are that good. I am limited by my own skill as of the moment, as long as you know what you are doing the camera cleanly follows through.Get the higher end XT3 if you are into sports photography and need a weatherproof body along with IBIS and higher frame rate video.Attached images are all from camera with minimal adjustment in snapseed.More on instagram@cygnopia"
5,"To begin with camera looks i will give 5/5. Retro look with premium finish.Light weight with good colour options to choose.Looking for a dslr entry level camera but couldn't find one,you can go for fuji mirrorless.15-45 mm lens work fine and potrait mode is excellent for candid photography.Value for money i must say"
5,"Great entry level camera to learn photography. Wanted to buy Sony Alpha but due to the global unavailability  in India had to look for alternatives. Out of other cameras I finally settled with Fuji X-T200 due to the Value for money comparison. 50K is a great deal for this camera.Fact - I had lens related issues on my first camera and for which I registered a replacement request. Hassle free experience and got a replacement camera working  as expected in 2 days. Kudos to Amazon and seller.In the box - Camera, lens(based on option selected), usb-c cable, Usb-c headphone connector, neck band, Leather shoulder bag, 16gb memory card, battery NP-W126sAfter almost using a week here's detailed review:CONS -1) Battery life (replacement batteries are available and along you can use dummy battery to use AC current)2) 4k Video - Auto Focus not good compare to Sony Alpha 6100/64003) Video shooting is limited to 15mins only.4) 15-45 kit lens is average. You will not notice unless use it professionallyPROS1) Value for Money2) Webcam function - WFH3) Articulating display is amazing4) External Headphone jack5) Photos can be transferred to mobile phone via Wi-fi (Videos can not be)Overall, buy extra set of batteries  and enjoy this camera to start your photography journey."
5,"Best camera in 50k range.:- It's Mirrorless, compact and lightweight:- Has more focus point than canon m50 II:- Using it's app your can use the live camera on :-mobile and other interesting features.:-It has all the latest features.:-It comes with whole kit - memory card, bag,etc.So, in the end it all comes down to your knowledge and experience to use the settings of the camera in the best possible way."
5,Fantastic image quality and sensor for its price. I love the classic fuji images color science. I've also purchased the xc 50-230 mm lens and the results are very pleasing. Very much recommended.Cons - the mobile app and pairing simy DOES NOT work
5,"This camera is the best in this range. Other competitors of this camera are the M50 and a6100. If you want a camera for shooting photos then this is the one you should choose. For photos, it is far better. Picture quality is awesome and can use Fuji simulation.For videos, it does provide 4K but the shooting limit is 15 mins. If you want to create small clips then you can choose this one.Autofocus is also good in this camera but Sony and Canon are better in autofocus.I compared this cam with the other competitors in this range and found this one more value of money. If in future you want to upgrade then Fuji has awesome range of camera and you can use these lens on other camera as well. Fuji has same mount(X) for all cameras.Fuji has wide variety of lenses and are not costly compared to Sony and Canon.Tip: Purchase XC 35 F2 lens once you are done exploring the kit lens. This lens is cheap(around 15K) and gives you a wide aperture to shoot blur backgrounds."
5,"Bought the Fuji XT200 mirrorless camera with stock 15-45 Fuji lens to replace a Nikon D3200.Sturdy build with good sturdy feel to all buttons and access door flaps. Great images as shared.Easy to learn and use menu. Loads of helpful expert videos about learning to use this model found online.Reasonably good battery life but as with all mirrorless cameras, suggest having a spare battery or be prepared to recharge if expecting heavy use of greater than 500-600 snaps.Battery life can be improved by using Electronic view finder instead of LCD screen for framing while taking pictures. Some very helpful menu features available.Very happy with the purchase so far.Was initially upset with the wonky looking packing the kit came in, even though it was securely sealed.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the wonky package was due to a free and very good complimentary camera bagüíìüòäüëç. Thanks to the vendor for the thoughtful gesture and prompt delivery in time for my holiday üòäüëçOverall, very happy with the camera, the vendor and delivery. 5 stars all the way."
5,"If you know to use a camera, it is plug and play. Auto mode is great. If you are new to cameras, like me, it takes some learning to know the huge list of features it can offer but it'll grow in you.Basic manual is provided and owner's manual can be downloaded. The app does the basic job. I don't have any experience with other cameras so, can't comment about the app in comparison. It's worth the money"
5,"Absolutely worth every penny. It is small, easy to hold. Comes with a touch-enabled rotatable LCD screen. Battery life could have been better, but no other peeves.Note:You get a 16 GB SDHC memory card with the camera; I would suggest buying an SDXC 128 GB with the camera."
5,Awesome camera. capturing very good quality image. Image is very sharp. 4K video quality is also perfect.  Battery life is bit low. Display is crisp and bright. Don't think otherwise go with this camera.. u will never regret after purchase.
1,"I got a product with an open box packing which was plastered. The product seemed okay inside but on close inspection I could find the country of origin of camera is Indonesia and the lens was from Philippines, while I was of the impression that the product would be from the Fuji‚Äôs legacy factories in Japan. It‚Äôs dubious Amazon doesn‚Äôt give the country of origin for their products sold in the platform, giving the sellers the opportunity to cheat people by selling a low end product desguised as the original factory claimed. It‚Äôs worthwhile to note that flip kart and tatacliq specify the make factory and country clearly on their website. I got the product not of my colour choice, that I could get a refund. But even if I came to know the product they delivered is from another country not expected, I think I would‚Äôve got a refund if they delivered the right choice of color for me. So beware and ensure the product comes from Japan itself before you buy it. At the time of writing, I had a better offer from tatacliq and they give the product originally from Fuji Japan factory...note that my seller here was Price..Perfect"
5,Nice Product
5,Very good choice compared to other cameras in mirrorless category..Box includes1. camera + lens2. 16 GB memory card3. Beautiful camera bagPoora paisa wasool.Great features at affordable price
5,"Don‚Äôt take pictures in jpg, use raw for better image and quality, don‚Äôt know why fuji jpg was not good in xt200 with human skin, reds poping thats the only problem at all"
3,Availability of lens is very big issue
5,Picture quality is superb kit lens is desent enough for the beginners who just shifted from mobile to camera day light performance is awesome suffers a bit in low light performance but overall its good you can go with this loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Picture quality is below average,won't feel it's a 50K camera,but a low priced point and shoot camera,not much easy to use with all settings. Feels not good on picture quality.other than this it's okay"
5,Great Purchase.
5,For college course use
5,"my first camera , excited and super happy with the purchasetook just 4 pics and believe me i am super satisfied with it"
4,"The grip is uncomfortable, the camera itself is really good for beginners. Battery life is not great, decent enough"
5,Very very nice
5,Very Good Product....U will Be loving it and have ur memories with good Quality
5,"Since most of the reviews revolve around comparing this to a DSLR, I guess my take on it comes from a size perspective. You also have this sony alpha mirror less camera here  but its too expensive currently.I cannot take a DSLR hiking, they're simply too bulky and too heavy to justify the space in my pack. When I looked at replacing my Canon, I went out to find something that I could get that was lightweight without sacrificing the quality of the images I had grown used to with the DSLR. This had an aesthetic I really liked and the features I was looking for as well. It doesn't look like a cheap point and shoot with a bigger lens strapped to the front. The controls are perfectly fine for me and are more second nature since I've spent a lot of time behind it. Like anything new one gets, you have to get used to it. I find the colors on pictures I take with this camera come out much better overall compared to my old Canon. It isn't excessively difficult to use, and I don't find the menu cluttered at all. The camera is very light and very small for what performance you can squeeze out of it, its footprint is about the same as my Samsung Galaxy s10e. The camera is mostly just wider with the lens mounted.I cannot attest to the video features as I do not use them.My only gripes about this camera are the kit lens and the materials, mostly the kit lens, and those are never really spectacular anyways. It just seems to be adequate for most circumstances, without ever being the ""perfect"" choice for a scene. Its easily replaced however, so you can learn on it before getting a new lens better suited to your tastes. That lightweight I enjoy comes at the cost of the materials unfortunately. The camera is VERY plastic-y and does not feel like it would survive a fall. I don't drop my cameras, but I'm not sure my old DSLR would have survived either. Better materials and weatherproofing would have meant a higher cost anyways, and that would've defeated the purpose of this for me.All in all, I find this camera perfectly suited for what I needed. I needed a lightweight, high image quality camera, and the Fujifilm XT200 got me there. Your mileage may vary though depending on your skill level, experience with much more expensive cameras, and overall attitude."
4,"The Fujifilm X-T200 is an inexpensive mirrorless camera that uses the company's X-mount. It replaces the X-T100, a camera that seemed promising when it was announced, but whose sluggish performance was a letdown. Thankfully, Fujifilm has put a lot of work into making the X-T200 both more responsive and full-featured.Key specifications:24MP APS-C sensor with Bayer color filter and faster readout speedsUpdated hybrid autofocus system with 425 phase-detect pointsRefined ergonomics, lighter body3.5"", 16:9 fully articulating LCD with 2.76 million dotsEasy-to-use touch menus2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder with 0.62x magnification8 fps burst shootingNew 'Clarity' effectOversampled 4K video with no cropAudio level controlsMicrophone and headphone inputs (latter via USB-C adapter)New Digital Gimbal and HDR video options.conclusionThe Fujifilm X-T200 is quite a bit different than its predecessor, the X-T100. While the X-T100 tried to be a scaled down version of the X-T20, Fujifilm failed to pull it off, for a variety of reasons.The X-T200 tries to be a scaled down X-T30 and more. It's a camera that should suit both amateurs who want a lot of physical controls, and smartphone upgraders who like the familiarity of touchscreen operation. And this time, Fujifilm has succeeded.From most angles, the X-T200 looks like many other Fujifilm X-series cameras, like the X-T30 and X-T3/X-T4. It has a DSLR-style body, plenty of dials on the top (though, thankfully, not as many as higher-end models) and an electronic viewfinder. What makes the X-T200 stand out from the more expensive cameras is its gigantic and bright fully articulating 3.5"" touchscreen."
5,"Here are a few things to note before you make a decision1. This is a nice option for anyone looking to get better pictures and videos compared to your Smartphone, especially if you are a content creator2. Don't get discouraged by the 15 min limit for 4K videos, because unless you are creating videos for commercial purposes, full HD resolution is way more than sufficient. Now, if you do need 4K, 15min is quite a bit for one shot.3. The XC kit lens provided is not the best option to get the most out of this camera. Considering upgrading to the significantly better XF 18-55F2.8-4 or a fast prime lens (16/23/35 - depending on your needs).4. If you are willing to spend another 30k, the X-T30 comes with the kit 18-55 option, but you will not get a fully articulating, screen which may be a deal-breaker.At this price point, you will no go wrong with the T200!Best all-round prime lens (subjective): Fuji 23mmF2 or Tokina 23mmF1.4 (just released)An alternative, comparable camera at this price point: Sony A6100An alternative option if you are only looking at casual photography: iPhone 11Do check out my other reviews on YT (Home Savvy Tech). I will be reviewing a Fuji camera in the near future."
5,"This is an absolutely amazing camera , for this price and this size it certainly exceeds expectations..The interface can take some getting used to, but once you are familiar it's a delight.With a good prime lens, it takes unbelievable pictures. Way better than counterparts from canon and nikon like m50 and z series.Also the battery life is not so great, go for extra batteries + charger for a better experience.I'm an absolute beginner even from a hobbyist perspective but the shots I've attached are all first trys with a 25mm prime lens.."
5,"Go for it, it's better than Canon m50 and Sony a6100. And cheaper too!Picture quality is excellent, you won't regret it. Surprisingly I absolutely love the film simulations, Classic Chrome is my favourite!To mkae your kit complete, you can buy the following:1. XC 35mm f22. XC 50-230mmThese two lens along with your kit lens will give you all you need to take your photography to nwxt level."
2,"I bought this camera, but now I'm refunding it because of images quality is very poor, Everything in the camera is good.  4K video, eyes focus is good but its image quality with this lens is not good.  Better lens should be provided with this camera because price is also too High, according to the money, its image quality is very bad."
4,"I bought this camera from offline market. Becoz i was not flexible on spendig such a huge amount thats too in advance. And one more thing one of my friend purchased this camera from here and he received a water bottle and a cheap quality bag. So guys Just check everything before u buy or go for offline options , becoz u might get cheated.."
1,"Picture size 5.00 mb maximum. It gets heat after 30 mins of use. Battery lofe 1 hour.If you zoom image and video quality gets down,In video follow focus dont work properly,Not for video and not for photo.Please don't buy. Compny is a cheater. Images get so much of noise."

1,"The mobile holder provided couldn't fit even my redme 7 pro and goes downwards while connecting.. Without fixing the mobile on it how to use the tripod and ringlight? Very bad experience. I have to return the item and search for another. But while submitting request to return item, it shows replacement only! Totally fed up!"
1,Phone Holder and led unit is claimed to have 360 degrees.. but it can't even hold the weight of my phone (k20 pro).. can't fix it to a particular angle coz there is no mechanism or method to fix it.. it only faces downwards.. there is only one angle ground facing.. very disappointed with the product
1,This item is not good at all. I don't know how people given five star. There is no refund system. Once you ordered this you are fixed.Think before ordering.
5,"The product is great and best for beginners. If you are searching for a ring light for shooting your videos , it is great. It's light weight but still strong . You can also adjust the brightness as per requirement and is actually very easy to use. Overall a good product."
5,"Really nice product, easy to assemble and amazing colours. Can also adjust the warmth and intensity. Good to use for video and photoshoots."
5,First of all I like its Highlighted feature Its RGB.This Is so amazing it has So Many Colours And Very Bright.And You Can Also Control the RGB with the Controller Its Amazing too. And You Got A Wireless Controller for CLICKING picture

4,"So, when I received this camera I was a little skeptical. It looked like the package had been opened multiple times. And definitely the parts had been taken out at least once since nothing in the box was sealed. There was also a finger print on the camera body hahaha! So needless to say I was freaking out a bit much.Twas the evening before Christmas and I really wanted to get this for my kid. My friend convinced me to try the thing out. I did. And it works perfectly. Lots of pics have already been taken. To off set the cost I have said this is a Christmas and Birthday gift combined.Now given the price point, it definitely does have loads of room for improvement. However, the main selling point was that it looks like a super expensive DSLR camera. Its good for beginners. and I hate to say this. IF it gets misplaced or ruined, it's not like I've plonked down 1L for this. I can cut my losses. CONS definitely quality of the picture. so it's really up to each person. For my 14 year old, it means the world. If you're in a similar conundrum, hope this helps!"
1,Can't recorded sound this camera and amezon don't help. Amazon are selling product without verified with deal and normally all are the defective product on electrical product. please do not buy the product from online amazon.
3,It is just a simple point and shoot camera with 45x zoom. No modes. No setting options. Picture quality is good but its not the best. If you spend a couple thousand more you'll get a better one
1,Guys please do not buy this camera..the quality of the image is really really very poor...just a waste of money..I am pretty much sure the pics taken from a mobile camera would b much better' than the camera pics.. and they don't have any return policy for this camera.... So don't think of buying it guys waste of money....
4,Picture quality during day time is excellent. Good for beginners. But picture quality is not good in low light. Best for outdoor photograph. Overall performance is excellent.
1,Guys please don't buy this camera.picture quality is worst.i complained about it and got my replacement camera.but got same issue in replacement camera as well.our normal mobile take better pictures than this camera... again and complained and returned the replacement camera..13000 is not worth at all..please don't buy
2,"Camera is good, but u cant change the shutter speed or focal length. There are too many modes to play withThe camera i had showed 1+1 year warranty and when i checked it on canon website they are not offering it for my camera currentlyAnd i did not get a sd card and camera doesn't work without a sd card. If there are options where u get sd catd witj camera go for that"
5,"One of the product where you get more than what you, pay. It ll take a while for you to learn the art of taking best shots. If you are not in to proffessional photography, but all you want to have is nice clean shots of events, academic, or research purpose, then its the one you are looking for. Must say about its extra ordinary 45x zoom. Which is the best in this segment. Buy this product with the aware of your actual purpose. Dissappointing thing is you cant take good shots in low light condition."
4,"The best part of this camera is its zoom capability. Picture quality is good. This camera is probably the best in this price range.Cons: The images of the objects in motion are blurred. So it is not good for snapping sports events, flying birds etc. No option to adjust shutter speed."
5,The camera is really very good. But issue with Amazon EMI discount offers... Bank charges more than as amazon says...
3,"Awesome,but image quality is with lot of noise,Super zoom ability use full for bird watching videography ,Only one drawback is the low screen resolution,It's suitable for Beginner photographer,Minimum Shutter speed is 1 sec please don't buy it for sports or birding or for fast moving object photography only useful for videographyGood device for personal use and travel photography"
5,"The 45x optical zoom is brilliant. However, this camera is only for beginners since it has few functions. The picture quality is ok in low light. Worth purchasing as your first camera."
5,"Overall this product is Ultimate. The 45X Zoom makes ur mind blow.Batter levels are btr but cant say good. Picture quality is decent not like wow.Other features are good and attractive. especially WiFi, remote control makes easy access.Instead of 16GB memory card they could have given a bigger one. Still its a decent product to purchase"
4,Zoom very very good picture quality not so bad but the process is late and camera grip and screen is small battery life is short charging time is long not for a long trip it's for short photography I am not satisfied with the performance but zoom is speechless. I have repurchased it after return and buy the Sony cyber short. after this i feel that canon is best
5,Zoomed images are bluronly for Close up imagesOverall good as per priceI writing this review after 1 year useWithout glad image blurWith flash good and better recommend with flashI bought last year 12300Now 17000 plusHuge difference in price
1,"canon sx430 Poor quality display compere to sony, i am not satisfyDont buy canon camera"
5,"Much better than I expected it to be. Apart from the excellent zoom and clarity, what I like is the Wi-Fi feature that enables me to transfer pictures immediately to my mobile and tablet, and also use my mobile as a remote for the camera .... A great buy!"
1,Worst quality camera....same as 13 mp mobile camera of phone... totally worst...only use for zoom... unsatisfactory productTotal money waste item not return
4,Camera is good at this price. Best part is its zoom quality super zoom. 1 time full battery can click 280+ pics. Color reproduction is nice. Light weight makes it easy to handle. Good camera for beginners like me.
5,"Just an OK point and shoot camera. After using my Nikon D5200, it is difficult to like any other lower version cameras. But zoom is good. Good light gives good images. Low light photos are not good. Still worth the money paid"
1,Hi Amazon. I would like to complain that the camera that I bought the seal on the box  was broken and also to my surprise it had photos which I shared. This is highly disappointing as it's a pretty costly thing. I am replacing the camera because of it being used ! The one stars are not for the cameras feature
3,"Material quality is balance, outstanding zoom,Image stabilization not good also picture quality,in sunlight excellent but low light very worst.I'm this price it's good camera for beginners.You must follow my insta account @ab_pic_horsyFor more pictures."
4,"The picture quality is so good 4/5It's easy to use but a little complicated 3/5For beginners, I would definitely recommend it cause it's the cheapest, a professional like camera at this price point , so I'll give 5/5Zoom power is incredible and amazing!"
5,I'm very happy to get this.. I am in a remote location...so easy to find all birds and animals of nature... Pitcure quality and especially zoom is very very good.. I would recommend for nature lovers.. captures landscapes very nicely.. image stabilization at 90x may be improved
4,"By comparing price with other it's a nice one, zoom quality is good, i m gving it 4 star because you cannot extend the warranty of this product this is the cons. i found only. Thank you"
5,"Very nice product, if portrait facility is there, it's an unbeatable product, easy variable, it's not that big showing in picture, it's small like digital camera, battery backup is very very nice"
2,"I purchased this on Dec 16. I was expecting this to be a good cam as described. Zoom is good but it wont focus on objects nearby. If you are expecting DSLR effect in photos then this one is not for you. Better to go for DSLR only. One major problem is, it records in 720p and not in 1080p as described. I returned and got refund for this."
5,Got it in 10700 in a sale on amazon battery backup is superb.. looks like a DSLR with full zoom bice product at a low price
5,"Awesome product in these price range, super zoom camera for beginers. Ignore negative reviews just go for it."
5,"Excellent zoom. Moon craters are seen clearly. The moons of Jupiter, rings of Saturn are also clearly visible. Phases of Venus can also be seen. It is giving better zoom than the costly dslr‚Äôs."
2,i click 5 or 6 photos very shocking for me camera body rise to a too much of heat. camera display going to sleep for unexpected timing. camera operation not support for wedding photography. i am a nikon fan but nikon z50 camera operation very bad exprience for me.
5,Picture quality and colors  are excellent. In this aspect it is ahead in the segment. It git decent autofocus but as a beginner that should not be an issue. I am digging in for more features. Will provide the full review later.
5,"Mirrorless entry level camera. Good for the next 10 years for us. We are amateur photographers, hence happy with this. Easy to handle as well."
5,Camera is amazing but didn't receive camera bag is disappointed
5,Its nice mirror less camera

1,"I was very confused about which ring light to buy. I truly thought this was one of the best options, because I didn't really know much about brands. When I recieved the product and I took it out of the box, it seemed to be okay. It looked flimsy, but I still I fixed it up. The joints were stiff and difficult to move. As soon as I set it up, it broke. The attachment of of the right light to the stand was fixed with some cheap form of a glue, and it had come apart. I don't recommend this product. Go for Osaka or something better. Definitely not worth the price üòê"

1,"Not value for money,,, quality was very poor,,Stand was ok ....but light is very very poor..Plastic material was low quality...Backing also"
2,Repeatedly this is happening with Amazon. Used material has been inserted inside old pack.. unfortunately I m late in opening the product. It is damaged and used or repaired product. Horrible experience üò°üò°üò°üò°
5,I bought the same light a year back and it‚Äôs still working but by mistake it fell and still it‚Äôs intact especially the light but one of the screw got loose and now I cannot bring it to the height I want but still I m using it doing some jugaad but I got another one to gift someone but turned out they already had the same one. So I kept it for myself and I m very happy with it. And yes they have changed the design and added some better features to it than last year so even more happy. üòÑ So this review comes from a person who is there old and also new customerüòÅ
5,"It's good for indoor shoots and specially of you don't have someone to take your photo. Lighting also works great, adding more life to the photos"
2,"Very bad built quality, the light is very fragile and the whole setup is not at all easy to assemble. The screws don't work properly and after assembling the equiments dont even stay tightly binded yo each other. As the screw is already loose.Won't recommend to buy this, as it broke down within a month. Worst product"
2,"I had a low budget and mainly wanted to buy this just for the LED ring light, since I already have a good tripod.This tripod is made of low quantity and barely can handle the weight of a phone. Would definitely not suggest buying it üëé"
5,Must say its an amazing product. It comes with three deferent light varients. Overall its lightweight combo and comprising with adjustable lamp brightness.

2,Fantabulous camera with games and fun frames which will give your child a great photography experience and make them wanting to explore the outside world....FOR 2 DAYSAbsolutely loved it but it stopped working after two days and wouldn't turn on even after charging it and trying multiple things.I do not think it is worth it....
5,Very nice product. My son love it and play with it all day.
5,"Best gift for children, compact and stylish look, I'm sure your child will love it."
5,The camera is cute and lovely colour..This is exactly same as the picture shown.. came in good package and my kid is just loving it.. Tag came along with.. WonderfulRecommend to buy this product
5,A really basic camera that works well for kids. Works better outdoors or in very good lighting as there is no flash. Worth the money. Try it out. This seller is also very co-operative and willing to help if you need help with instructions.
1,The camera battery was outside the pack and was damaged. The pack was not sealed. Please do not order the product if you are planning to gift it to your little one. It's completely frustrating to see product in such a condition. The LCD screen of the camera is full of scratches so probably a used one it seems.
1,video fonts is so small...it not useful for kids...one more thing before ordering pls check the tc because there is no money refund policy trying for refund money its asking to exchange the product only...making fools to customers ..and their hard earn money. .As i have ordered this with so excitement  but it all vanished.pls do return the money back
1,Display and camera both are useless even kids cannot see anything & battery also not last more than 15 minutes  better get a 1000 rupees Nokia phone so then can learn taking pictures from it
1,It stopped working very quickly. It's very complicated for a child to use and the quality of the display and buttons was very low. May as well buy a pretend camera for much less and let them use their imagination. (my daughter is doing that with this one now.
5,"Dont think twice value buy for novice. It is good , it need memory card and adapter to charge.image quality is not good but ur kide sure love it"
1,Worst product ! Didn't even work for half an hour ! First the charger wire got snapped ! Next after charging with a similar charger it didn't get charged at all ! My grandson got very much disappointed as it was on his birthday I gifted him ! Now tell me where to get it repaired !!
3,After clicking the picture we can not see how the pic is on camera screen.  We hv to down load the pic and only see.  4 yrs old kids  enjoy with help of elders to see the output. .
1,"Extremely small item. Seller won't accept it, evwn though it says on Amazon that it can be returned within 7 days. Not suitable for kids to use. Extremely disappointing experience."
2,The mrp is 680 and the customer is being charged 899. I returned the product due to this reason.It is very small in size and made in chinaThe material is plasticNot worth at all
1,"I wish there was an option of zero stars, my kid was very sad, the screen was not working.Cheap quality product. And it does not have option of refund."
1,It's for the child of age 4to5 when child is asking for mobileMain drawback is that is non returning if you don't like u can't return the same.Pls don't buy its waste of money.
1,It started fine so that I couldn't find any reason to return it but when I had inserted a memory card it stopped working.  Pics taken = 0Since then not charging at all...Already exchanged it once becoz earlier one was not starting at all..now this one is the same...Don't go for it...waste for money
2,Not upto the expectations.. picture is looking like those taken in old basic model mobile phone. Very dim n dull... quality is not good.
4,"A very cute little camera for the kids. Easy to operate. The image quality though is isn‚Äôt very good, but acceptable in this price range."
5,This is my third time buy.I have bought this camera as presents for kids in my family & they all loved it.It is extremely handy for a 4-5year old child to use. Excellent quality. A must buy to keep kids away from gadgets.
5,Excellent product. My son just loved it
1,"I have purchased this item 2 times, but every time he is delivered usable and defective this item,Worst product i ever bought..got used one so had to return and got a non working one..waste of time."
4,Nice toy camera for kids... They can have there own camera.But very light weight camera
1,Video Player is loading.
5,Very nice camera
1,I purchased it for my son. the picture quality is worst and the lighting is not at all good. we could get very good and much better item for this price.  not at all satisfied. we have to buy  additional memory card to take pictures.
1,"The product quality was not as per the cost of the product. Hence, returned."
5,My kid loves this camera very well. Its a must have product for kids to stimulate their brain activity.
5,Amazing product. All in all it is a very good product for its price. Lots of features and definitely worth the price. A must buy for if your child wants a camera.
5,"The box is so cute and the cam is completely fine, buy one for your kids and see them smile"
3,I ordered this for my 5 years old daughter.... She is happy with it as a kid. But it's resolution is not as it was show in the picture. Day light pictures are satisfactory but low light pictures are horrible.....
5,Nice product for kids
5,My kids are very very happy with the product.For them picture quality is not important but the fun is very important and that purpose is served by this product.
1,Worst thing wasted my 900 rs just so useless. It is so dam small worth 300
1,Worst product i ever bought..got used one so had to return and got a non working one..waste of money
5,"It is good as a toy, kids love it. Picture quality is bad but kids dont care."
5,Nice product.. Clean packing accessories are availabe. Working fine
5,Very nice camera for kids to have fun and my kid liked it very much
1,"Not charging, not powering on."
1,It‚Äôs way too small and quality doesn‚Äôt match up.It doesn‚Äôt come with sd card and that‚Äôs additional  cost
1,Not a fitting for sony 6400l
5,I really  wanted  microscope which  can give better  resolution  for  microscopic  animals it's handy and portable  to carry  around.  It works great  for magnification  till 5 mm-1 ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§è‡§Æ microscopic  animals
5,"This is a great stereo microscope. I mainly use it for electronic repairs and it performs excellently. The image quality is more than enough to visualise even the tiniest of SMD components. Also you have pretty wide clearance between the lens and work piece, which is a must for electronic repairs. All in all, a good value for money."
5,Best quality.
4,Nice product
3,It is mentioned that it is 12 inch ring light but what I received was 28 cm(10 inch) one. The tripod stand isn't included with the ring light.
5,Light and tripod is good but ring light wire was weak and tripod legs was loose  but easy to use light in weight
5,"Just got it so haven't tested it in the field yet, but seems to have sturdy legs that extend very, very high with a surprisingly fluid head that has no jerking motion its lateral or vertical motion. After more usage, if you have a heavy camera (I use a audio recorder on top of a large camera), I found that it tends to slip backwards unless the tension is tightened very tight, at which point it becomes hard to move the camera up and down, so I am going to attach a different head to it but still use it for the height, which is very good."
1,The advt is clearly misleading. In the product image they show three steps of.extension for the tripod. But there are actually two only. So what they are showing in the image is a different product. Also the attached mobile stand is that of cheap quality. Simpex tripod do have its own quality whether is two step or three step. But seller provided the wrong photo.
5,Very Good Quality Product
1,What I received was Elois vct988. There was no Simpex branding on the product or on the box. The carry bag for the tripod was torn and repaired by tape. I had to return the product.
5,"This product is superb.I have bought it my for my teenage son, and he is so happy with this product.It's Easy to use and quality is very nice."
4,It's OK as per price. Not for outdoor activities.
5,Very good product.Value for money
2,"Although it says 3 kg, it tumbles when used with additional lenses."
5,Not light weight. But it's brilliant product. Worth it.
5,Excellent product.
5,Nice

5,The tripod is sturdy with a well-built body. Recommended for indoor DSLR camera shoots.
5,Good
5,Good and study

5,It's good
5,Good
3,"It was a good and decent Tripod for beginners until for an year. After that, some sort of sticky oil is leaking in all the rotating parts, which may damage your camera later. Beware of that. I didn't expect the product will damage this much quick. Other than this, there is no other trouble regarding the stability and its rigidness for the money you spend. Attached some sample images, where you can see the leaking oil. This was my personal experience."
5,"We all know how expensive Sony Full frame E mount lenses are to own. I was looking for a full frame wide angle lens for my Sony A7iii. But when i came to know about this adaptor through Youtube, it was a great alternative to those expensive lenses, since i was already having few canon EF-S lenses.So with some scepticism, i ordered this adaptor. The first one that came, didn‚Äôt worked as it should have. Camera was constantly freezing and auto-focus wasn‚Äôt working at all.I talked to the seller and they immediately gave me an option to replace with another. So i placed the replace order and when i got the new one, it works absolutely fine.Tests i have done on following lenses:- Canon EFS 10-18mm- Canon EF 50mm 1.8- Canon 18-55mm kit lens- Tamron 18-400mmIt works on every lenses. Auto focus works fine. Sometime it struggles to focus but then its totally understandable. Sometime the auto focus wouldn‚Äôt work if zoomed but once you manually focus the lens, the auto focus will start focusing again.Didn‚Äôt experimented on video yet.So far i am satisfied with the purchase."
4,"One star reduced for not being a ""tight"" fit! Had to fix it with a bit of insulation tape. The contacts work. I'm using it with a Tamron 70-200 with a Canon ef mount. All systems available. Not as good as the MC 11, but it's also seven thousand cheaper!"
4,This product fits my sony a7iii very well and the autofocus is working perfectly. I was worried about the eye focus feature using this adaptor with my ef lenses but its working perfectly fine. Overall no worry in auto focusing while shooting stills.
1,When I did order it then showing on screen and 16 GB sd card but when I did delivered it I found 8 Gb sd card.....This is cheating with customers..And quality is is not well of this cameraThis is not Good ......Don't purchase it.....
5,Nice
5,"Nise camera picture quality also nice but no Wi-Fi and bluetooth are not there in this camera, charger adaptor, charger cable, and camera case all items are inside the box"
1,"This product is soooo bad even in indoor the camera quality is too bright u cannot see the face definition and there is grains in the picture even during day light. The camera lens will blast if u point at something bright.Rather keep the money add more money and directly buy a good quality camera. Am telling even if u buy this camera after few years u would want to upgrade to a good camera and at that time nobody would want to buy this outdated no good quality camera. THERE IS NO REFUND TOO so, don't do the mistake I did. I hope u will listen to me."
3,"Only buy if you need a camera only else buy a smartphone. Only experts can take good photos in it. It has an easy auto mode which I think is the default mode and the pictures will be very bad , making you think it's a very bad camera( see the bad reviews for a simple device). Believe me put the camera in auto mode(normal) and it will take good pictures by just point and shoot. Very small and easy to carry. Display is not great so you have to check pictures on PC. Outdated compared to smartphone. Tricky to use compared to my first experience with kodak digital camera which was the best, simple and ease of controls even though it was in early 2000s."
4,Cons - No functionality in settings it is best in Auto mode if you turn it manually it doesnt have functions as well as its horrible.Good for just capturing moments in family.Well this purpose is also served by a smart phone too.It would encourage you to add 5000‚Çπ more and get a smartphone with good camera it wipp be better and with more utility.
3,"Its taking around 8Mb photos with not so much details. With outdoor its capturing some good shots but in indoor shoot its not taking that 20MP shots for what I purchased actually. Focusing is also an issue. But battery backup is very good, without flash you can take approx 250 or more shots and with flash around 160 to 180 shots. Sad to review also this one"
5,"Got it today. Camera, case, wrist strap, battery, charger, data card, warranty card - all nicely packed and finely delivered. Tested a little. Not all the functions tested. Considering the price, the product is good."
1,Picture quality like 5mpVery worst qualityAmezon say not returning this product because u r buying.Tele collar is very worstPicture function is very old type.And not return assessable from amezon
1,I have ordered this product 3rd time.. Because gd experience with camera.. But did not satisfied with this time with first look. Not feeling original this time in hand.. Even covering on battery looks like blister means reburbished.And after ordered unit price droped 600rs with in hour.
5,It's small and handy. You can take beautiful snapshots and the images so produces is better than mobile (when you enlarge the image or print it on a larger size)
5,Good for day light pictures. Pictures under tube/LED light are not so great. Battery backup is good. Quite small in size.
4,blur nahi hai but iss budget mein theek haiclose shot is niceauto stability is nice
4,"The product is good and fine, bit if you need clear picture and best quality in low price, I think go for Kodak."
3,"Picture quality is decent, at this price its ok. But still the picture details are not clear. Expecting an improvement in the picture clarity."
2,Not good at all.My mobile pic is greater than it.
4,The box says it has digic 4+ processor and the manual says digic 8! These bluffs aren't expected from canon! This is the second model I've purchased for my business needs and I assure you this is the best of it's budget!
5,nice cam
1,Good for kids to play.. mobile takes better and crisp than it. No autofocus makes most of the images blurred. UseLess camera.
1,camera quality is too bad mobile camera is better then this
4,It is very easy to use for beginners.
4,The camera was received in good condition and is working fine. Still to explore many features
3,Minor damage in lense. But up to now no problem occurs.Image quality is not that much great.Some times generating noisy images.Over all ok..
5,Super pictures qualityValue moneyHi zoom super very good
5,"during outings this is really cool, good pics and easy to handle"
3,The cost of the camera in your phone is equal to this product. Decision is yours.
5,"so far so good  as expected, @moulis_journey"
4,very nice shots i love it
3,Bad
1,No memory card with the product but when i check in reviews clearly mention 8gb memory card included
1,Total waste of money Amazon is looting our money pliz don't buy it
4,Good
1,worst support
2,It is better to buy a Mobile than buying this one.
1,Pic clarify not good worrest product camera very small
4,Good
3,Works fine for the price
4,Now days smart phone has a better picture quality
4,good product
1,Picture quality is very bad. You can see pixels on screen as well as photos. Night photographs are not very cler
1,"Couldn't fit it to my lens, even though I got the right size."
5,"Very good product, especially during this Covid scenario when all of us are at home, this is a good engagement product. Lighting is pretty good and the stand Holder is pretty strong and sturdy."
5,"It's awesome ,after getting this item I am fully satisfied ,nice product in this low price ,just woww....if u want to make makeup video go for it .....thank u Amazon for make me happy"
1,I returned the product. The size on the site is misleading. The actual light is very small.
5,"I like the ring light. It‚Äôs easy to use, the light has many variations."
1,I was spend Rs1000/_ to remove from this adopters and it not recognising f value so I can't take pics means purely waste of money
2,"This does not comes with ring to adjust aperture. There if your lens do not have a aperture to control , then this is useless."
1,"Its mentioned in the description, but auto focus doesn't work. And moreover I can't return it. They would replace with same item which is useless. Bad experience with this particular purchase"

5,This is an awesome product which was delivered on time and has proved worthwhile for protecting the display screen of my Nikon D5300. Ease of handling makes it very convenient for a person to apply it by oneself at home. I however chose to get it done by a shopkeeper handling mobile phones.
5,The guard protects the viewfinder screen.
3,Easy to install
1,Absolutely useless product. There is no way you can align it properly and it immediately collects dust particles even before you start sticking it. It would just ruin the screen even further. Money wasted.
5,"Hi,  Excellent quality, delivering extra protection, delivered in time, good package, easy to clean the Scratchgard lcd without fear and I recommend chose the right Camera Lcd protector screen, that is Scratchgard"
2,The Scratchgard is not good in terms of quality.. It already have scratch on the upper layer..Due to the packing it already have bend and created bubbles permanently.. Worth RS.150 only as it fits the screen exactly..
1,Not worth at this cost....I would recommend to go to shop and buy from there.
5,"Works as advertised. Good quality scratch guard. Need to be careful while applying it on your screen as if done by amateur hands, can lead to air bubbles being formed."
5,"Easy to apply, can be used on D5500 and D5600 as well, as the screen is of the same size. Must have for protecting your expensive DSLR screen from scratches."
4,Good quality. Just make sure you apply it on the camera with very carefully
5,Product is good but cost hight
5,"Covers the screen completely for D5300 and easy to clean, protects screen from smudges and oily residue after usage."
5,Exact size and comes with good quality. Transparent and I see a very a great transparency after tue application. Thanks amazon for quick dispatch
5,good product
5,The film is thick and seems to have high endurance. It fitted my new Nikon D5300 monitor perfectly.
5,Super
2,"Average quality, overpriced, there are more which are selling for Rs.70-300Go check out some where else too"
5,Excellent product
4,"should have provided two , as it left  with one bubble"
5,It's thin and once placed over screen doesn't feel like as if something is over the screen! I used it for my NIKON D5300.
5,Super liked it. It was easy to fix for myself and no air bubbles.
1,Very bad product...cheating customers
5,Fits perfectly end-to-end without any bubble...
1,"Simply waste, don't buy it. I tried very carefully, but failed with a lot of bubble inside. Finally thrown it. Also cleaning cloth is waste material."
5,Perfect fit
3,It is very expensive. It is a normal screen guard and definitely not worth the price. Better go to any nearby mobile shop and get it adapted for the camera.
1,Not worthful. I was expected tempered glass.
5,its product worth buying  and it is to install on the camera LCD
1,it is not worthy of money....
3,"Product was little damaged, with some scratches, didn't have time to replace. Price is more for the product."
3,"Ok quality, not that great."
1,Simple
5,Great
4,"Good service by Amazon india, Good packaging and delivered before time.Very Good quality material, edges are curve which blend with Nikon screen. It perfectly impose over screen."
5,Fits well and quality is good.
5,A bit expensive but nice product.Installation is very easy. Instructions are already mentioned on the cover. Display clarity is also good.
1,Wastage of money... Not worthy
1,"Please do not buy this Screen guard. Quality is very poor and when u try to stick it, lots of air bubbles on screen guard"
5,Perfect pricing. Nicely packed and was easy to install. i also received a lcd cleaner for free which was never mentioned while placing an order. Nice deal would recommend others to buy.
3,Protection screen is good..but should be cheap.
5,Bought this to make YouTube videos...this ring light has 3 colors and 3 brightness settings for each. Improves the lighting situation when there is a lack of natural lighting. Can mount your phone in the holder provided.Does not come with an USB adapter. Sturdy and good quality.
1,Didn‚Äôt match the standards.. product returned. Not worth for high end photography
3,It is good not bad
5,This product is amazing. Worth buying it. Value for money
1,The product shown in Picture-1 is different from other pictures. The one they deliver DOES NOT have the metal sliding thing into which flash unit slides in. Totally useless. If you try to push your expensive flash into the plastic slide then it will definitely damage the sensitive connector pins at the bottom of the flash.
3,"The hole for the umbrellas is not big enough for a photography umbrella's stem. And, unlike in the picture, the item arrived with a plastic cold shoe mount. I've requested a replacement; if the replacement item is not like picture also, I will update my review."
5,"This is a great product at Rs.350. I was able to mount my Godox flash (tt685-f) along with a 32 inch umbrella. It was rock solid with the flash mount lock mechanism available with the flash and the bracket provides good tilt angle. Overall, great product."
1,Doesn't have the meatal part as shown in the pictures. It's difficult to mount a godox flash as it it too tight. Might damage the flash. Waste of money
3,"Not reached my expectations,failed to maintain small ligth and umbrella ,broken in first use not recomend this ,but compared to other items still better one"
2,Very poor quality and nobs don't hold properly and hence tend to move
4,Product is good.  Only thing is that the umbrella hole was too small to fit in my umbrella.
1,"The picture and product both are different and I have opted for return but Amazon not conforming my return.and there is umbrella hole in it, totally I would say worst product."
4,Something missing from ad. But it is till well.
4,Good Product
5,"i brought this to mount led light to stan it is the best bracket, upper holder is not steel material like show in image but made of hard plastic materialwhich is enough to hold light.good product"
5,"Strong enough to hold the 120"" godox softbox with a Speedlite as well"
2,good product
3,Plastic material. Doubtful life.
5,"Nice product from seller, good packing which protects it from any damage, reasonable cost"
5,Good Quality .Useful product.

5,Amazing product
1,not good at all.
1,Got different brand cheap quality item... i will not suggest... this is cheating
1,Fake image. Firat image provided for this product is absolutely fake. The hole is not even exact for a godox 80cm octabox
1,Use lese
1,"There is not much that can go wrong with a laptop cleaning kit. But this one is seriously TERRIBLE QUALITY. The screen cleaning spray is what you would expect, but apart from that everything included is pathetic.1. The description says that it includes 2 microfiber cloths, however neither of them is actually microfiber. The thicker one cleans decently, but the other one is made of such low quality material that I had to dispose it the same day.2. The description says ""Rubber blower very powerful"", and I can't help but laugh at that line. The blower is so weak that it can manage to displace a particle of dust only about 3 cm from its original place. Absolute waste, and another item I had to trash the same day.3. The brush is alright at best, but the strands are way to soft and flexible to effectively clean dirt and dust from under the keyboard and in the speakers. I feel you require at least a slightly more firm brush to do the job effectively.Overall, I strongly suggest to NOT BUY this cleaning kit, unless you are alright with a substandard kit!"
5,"Good product with all necessary items. Blower is a must for keyboards. can be used for mobiles to clean the plug ports like charging port, headphones, speaker areas etc. also used for laptops.There 2 clothes . rough one is for cleaning with liquid.The softer one is for cleaning small smudges, finger printers and finer cleaning.Worked excellently when I used for my laptop and mobiles, ipad"
2,I don't like the quality at all - no way to return it also. The clothes are very thin and transfers any impurities in the palm - not at all recommended for cleaning expensive stuff including spec glass. Luxor nano is far better product.
1,The bottle does not have a spray nozzle. The hole is blocked. I tried to pierce a hole in the nozzle and managed after great difficulty.The liquid is of very bad quality. My touchpad stopped working after cleaning with this liquid. Do not recommend.
1,Good ones I have used are very powerful in cleaning and dry immediately. This one stays wet for very long time. The bottle head stopped spraying. I had to move the liquid in another empty bottle.
5,My laptop was a mess. This one pretty much did the job
1,"The liquid given in, is the worst quality. i don't recommend to use in your laptop screen or smartphone.  Brush hairs get fallen regularly while using. Clothes were decent and air blower was good. So dont buy this combo you have got better options in this price range."
3,Overall good product.I like those washing cloths comes with it.But the liquid is very bad.It puts some irremovable patches on the laptop screen when the solution dries out.
5,"cleaned tv,tablet,mobile clearly"
3,The liquid is okay to use for cleaning of TV/laptop mobile screensin general but the fabrics provided with the liquid in the package is horrible. Not worth the price.
1,Please don‚Äôt buy it. Waste of money.
5,Product is very practical to use and the quality is good
4,"Overall good one, cleaning cloth could have been bigger..."
5,Overall it was ok but one pump like got little bit damage while in intransit.
4,Nice product but low quality Microfiber Cloth used.
1,Cheap price cheaper quality don't fall for the cheap price
5,most useful product
4,Satisfactory
4,nice work / collection for personal laptop cleaning; hopping for the best results in the future
5,Good
4,You can clean keyboard and Monitor CPU etc
5,Good
5,good buy
2,I dont know whether it will be useful
4,Everything is working well!!
1,This is not for LED.  Simply cheating by displaying LED. It is only for LCD.I returned this product. Be careful
5,Very nice to clean pc and led!I like the quality fo product.
5,Good product
4,It is useful to clean and maintain laptops
5,"Product is good .Will recommend for others for cleaning their mobiles,pc screen,etc."
5,Nice product
3,Good for some laptops not good for old ones
4,Good Product....

5,Nice in this price
4,Good
4,"product is good, thanx a lot"
5,"Great, i like it."
3,"(i) Grab a Flyfilms Universal Rail System 15 mm Rod Support for HDV Video Film Shooting Movie to move the camera on the rods and also to have the QR base plate, for less price. (ii) Get a mattbox sunshade separately. (ii) No point in getting this Matte box for a higher price. Issues: 1. Camera does not move on the rods 2. No Quick release for the camera. The QR would make the user to lift the entire system, camera with the matte sunshade, base plate and whatever you plan to fit on this, like a follow focus, mic, whatever it is. The netire build up would be on the set up.Sold by: Flyfilms"
3,"Ok Product.Plastic quality is acceptable ,but don't keep high expectations! For Low budget film makers ,it may save the day.It's more of like a light cutter for the lens, from the sides....Not really a Matte box in that sence !but something is better tn nothing!"
3,Just for show off actually means nothing give some look to your camera & a feel of matbox to your kit
5,"The build quality is excellent and doesn't feel cheap whatsoever, it is really really easy to assemble but my only issue is that it is useless whilst shooting with the 50mm canon lens as the doesn't reach the hood area"
4,"Easy to use, easy to assemble..."
5,This is not a very professional matte box. Its just for show and look. My camera looks beautiful while I use it.
5,Easy to use..Easy to assemble..Just chek your lens diameter before purchase..i haven't checked but i will use this product with my camera..
1,Hi!The produce is send by the seller is incomplete without Rig.Very bad product.
5,Super product

Lock not working properly.1 set of extra rubber bush provided for the tripod base. Very delayed delivery by Amazon (I am a prime customer)also extra delivery charges applied ."
4,This tripod is really good for beginners and amateur photographers. The tripod is really sturdy and is made of good quality. The seller feedback was quick and they responded every time when I didn't receive my free led light.
5,Sturdy tripod. Packing was excellent so product could reach unharmed. Thanks
5,"The tripod is very handy to use, light weight so I can carry it in any location easily, yet it's very strong and sturdy and can easily handle weight of the camera and because of it's fluid head, it's very comfortable to use for Video purpose."
5,"Nice product ,smooth pan tilt .useful for filming better than vct 899 as it have excess height jerking probability is high..it is best when used at moderate height light weight and can be used as a stabilizer...as well....thanks prizma for this prdt"

1,"Product delivered is totally different product and of low quality while the one in the original advertisement picture is good quality product ... DO NOT BUY as half of the accessories are NOT provided like the power cord, carry bag, USB charging points and 3 mobile holders as mentioned.It seems the seller is openly fooling people and you can confirm that from my pictures.Do Not get fooled rather buy reputed good tripod. I am returning this since it is of no use to me."

5,"I still have the Rx100 (mark1)...  It is one of the most used cameras (Even more than my RX1)Still, I got this camera (Rx100 VA), because of faster AF Speed (phase detect) and larger buffer.There are other pluses, (full flip-up screen, 4K, Color profile, EVF, shooting grip support, etc.) which are only secondary.I like it more than the latest version - Rx100 VI, because1) It is less expensive2) This has f/2.8 aperture at 70mm (equivalent), which is better than similar aperture at only 40mm (equivalent) for Rx100 VI"
5,"I've been into casual photography+travel for over two decades. Having owned a reel cam, DSLR, mobile device with an excellent camera. I was at a juncture where I was fed up with carrying my bulky DSLR+ a telephoto + a wide + a prime lens + iPhone all the time and having to keep switching them was not fun anymore. I am not a pro-level photographer and sensed its time I bought a camera that could cover all the capabilities of my DSLR and yet somehow fit inside my pocket. After months of research, trials, etc. I was able to narrow to the Sony RX100 M5A.About a week into usage with 100's of photos and some video shooting. I can safely say, this is the best point n shoot compact camera ever made!Of course, there are a lot of questions especially at this price point where you can get more capable DSLRs or Mirrorless cameras. The question that raises to the top 'is it really worth close to a $1000' For those pondering over this, by all means, go for a bigger camera if you need scalability. The RX100 is more suited for people like me who need something pocketable and yet shoot DSLR like images albeit with compromise on video recording which is limited to 5 mins.Despite its limitations, you would yet see, this is the preferred camera by Vloggers/YouTubers because of the versatility it offers. Being a solo traveler, with a DSLR,  fiddling with camera settings + lens simply kills the fun of traveling and enjoying what's in front of you.  This is where the RX100 series closes the gap. Just snap the camera from your pocket and shoot.In the end. This is a fantastic camera with a very tricky price where you are paying mostly for convenience it offers which in my mind, worth it!"
5,I haven't used it much but the reviews online say it's capable of awesome things. So far I found it awesome and don't find any issues other than the fact that you will always need extra battery packs. Image quality is insanely good.
3,Comes at a cost of DSLR (starting price of most DSLR) but it is nowhere close to it.I would still prefer to hold my DSLR for Portrait pics.Good for taking videos.
5,I always had good impression about the product becoz i used it many times before as my friends have them. But it's very unfortunate i need to return becoz of my location change. I'll be placng a new order once i gets shifted to new locn. Trust me pic qlty is just superb & smooth operations. Follow the manual u'll get everything.
5,Well go for it without a second thought . Its a beast for videos. You can check my channel: 'Discovering Nearby' for its full review.

3,"After using the printer for a few days, here is what I experienced:Pros:1. Unboxing and Setup was easy and quick2. Printing was fairly simple3. Black print is fast and crispCons:1. Downloading the driver was a terrible experience. The HP Website was so slow, I could finished my lunch, evening snacks and it was still downloading!2. Colour print is absolutely worst. Highly pixlated and no sharpness even after selecting best quality in the settings.3. Printed a picture of my nephew on a photo paper and after 24 hours, it hadn't dried and got smudged when touched and spoilt the whole print.Conclusion: if you are looking for home printing and if 90% of it is B&W, its an excellent printer. Its good if you wish to print color text too. However, one of the worst printer for color photo printing. I wish I had purchased Epson Ink Tank printer!"
2,Doesn't support wifi connectivity wrong details in comparison section. Only usb connectivity.
4,I am giving 4 star due to HP support staff. I bought one printer with Amazon. Item deliver on time but product is defected. I replace the item receivd another printer. Now working properly. But HP support staff said that it was PC software problem for colour defect. Not proper support from them. But Amazon deliver on time. Thank you so much
1,I am an expert in ITand this product is just garbage. When I calibrate the print heads it does not take place and prints are all distorted and of poor quality. Tried to get a replacement the same day but amazon is not letting me do so. Everytime it takes me to consult an expert and the support person repeatedly asks the same questions again and again and finally they ask to contact HP. Total waste of my money. Just a landfill now.
4,"The printer is okay till now. It came with two sealed HP cartidges- black and tricolour; four bottles of sealed HP inks, one power cord, one USB cable and a polythene cover.USB cable is smaller than the earlier versions like GT 5800 series ( smaller the USB cable, faster the connection). Installlation of cartidges is some tricky. You have to carefully remove the orange clamps by rotating the lever in arrow direction.There is no installation CD. You have to download it from HP site.In the first day, printing may not be good. It will take time for ink system to fill the cartidges.Earlier I used GT 5810, it is same to same except some minor variation.Overall the printer is good for photo print xerox, scan etc."
1,Print head error after 30 prints and 2 weeks. 3 visits to HP service center and now they want me to buy print heads as the print head which came with printer is out of warranty. Printer is under warranty.
1,"This product made in China you can expect worst quality by default,black and white print is okay. Color print is very bad. Scanning is normal. Good bye HP I am not buying your printers,scanners any more."
5,Delivered and got installed by HP team in one day.It's looking good and all functionals are decent.Even print quality is commandable.One concern I read was on the size constraints but I felt it's pretty ok.It's only occupying quarter of my study tableOverall good buy as I bought with discount for 9.9 k.
4,This product HP 315 Ink Tank Printer is a decent printer for home use. Color Scanning and Printing takes 4-5 minutes for a single print sent from a Laptop via HP Smart Desktop App. Direct Scan and Print takes 1-2 minutes. Print quality is good for the price of Rs.9400. Ensure that you have done proper printer settings for good quality print. Not recommended for Business use as it is slightly slow (almost all non-laser printers are slow only). The received product was already registered for warranty a month before I received this product. I hope the 'Appario Retail' seller has not scammed me as to who else could have registered the product a month before the customer. There is no Wifi on this model which may be a concern for some. But you can always convert such USB-based printers to wifi printers using TP-Link routers.  Overall I would rate this product as the perfect printer for home use.
1,"Print Quality is pathetic, used superior quality paper. 40% of print outs either getting stuck inside printer or torned."
4,"Print quality is very good, printer installation is very easy, but software installation takes time.Printer is latest but the drivers needed for scanner function is a later version. Few extra steps needed for full functions. Other wise very easy."
4,Print quality is not the best but good for home use. Printing speed is little slow. Installation is easy.
5,"Print quality is as expected, nice u may say, its a large Pinter, consumes space.HP Services though slow was nice.Thanks to service engineer who came to install the printer, as he replaced the faulty colour print head supplied with the Printer."
5,Print quality is good. It easy to install and repack. To some extent value for money.
4,"The prints are OK for both color and BW. They are not awesome but decent. It's a line printer, each print will take around 10-15 secs."
5,"No doubt, printer is good and prints good. The packaging was also great and satisfied with it, but there was no Amazon sticker in/on the product.And the most important thing there was no Invoice/Bill, which is always present for any small-to-small product.Satisfied by printer and highly recommends it."
3,"Color prints are not of best quality, can't produce orginal vibrant colors, always very dark, otherwise works fine."
5,"Printer is very good and fast, very economical to use. Can print from mobile also with otg cable. Print from mobile is slow but from pc very fast. Easy to use and scanning and copy also good."
5,"I love all the features of this. If you are looking for a nice printer for home use, it is good to go."
5,Printer is really good with nice options in the HP Smart App.
1,Yet to get installation support. BUY ONLY IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ENGINEER HANDY FOR INSTALLATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE REMOTE. GOOD FOR TECHNICAL CUSTOMERS.
5,Since I started working from home and my child also online school printer became essential for us. This printer is very easy to install and use. Also this gives good quality of print. It also used for scan and copy. So overall nice performance and worth putting money on it.
5,I struggled a bit during installation of the printer...
5,Nice printer. Easy to install and take printouts.
1,No proper customer service from the manufacturer hp from the product received date of Sept 11 2021 to till today.
4,THIS PRINTER IS AWESOME BUT HAVE ONE PROBLEM OF SMUDGE THE INK ON GLOSSY PAPER
1,Good printer but Amazon not provided Rs.1500/- discount inspite filing complaint????
4,Value for money
5,Printing speed is low
1,Unable to print
3,Print is very slow other wise all are average.
1,Touch problem
1,First day first showüëéüò°Very DisappointedAs you see colour where not properly set as pictureTotally worst
3,The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving.  One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.
4,"Nice product, all function available, futuristic product, wit wifi , scanning copy, multi function.Only cons is the set up via mobile app it is easy for setup watching youtune video.But for window installation it is difficult, as it is a new printer,hence driver properly not worked, u need to take guidance to HP customer support.Hp customer support was very helpful  guided me 2 hrs & get the installation completed.Ink consumption still not rated, as 1 week only i am using , quality & usability aft insatalltion is pretty good for home use.."
1,"1) Printing SPEED per page VERY SLOW,2) PRINTING COST OF PER PAGE VERY HIGH, TOTALLY BOGUS / MISLEADING INFORMATION CIRCULATING  BY HP THROUGH FABRICATED ADVERTISEMENT REG HP PRINTER 2723 JUST TO MISGUIDE CONSUMERS/ CUSTOMERS.  HP-805 CARTRIDGE COST TOO HIGH BUT PRINT OUTPUT VERY POOR ...ONLY 25-30 Pages. ALSO 805 CARTRIDGE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE EXCEPT AMAZON. PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS SAME AS PURCHASE OF ELEPHANT FOR PERSONAL USE !!!"
1,"Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive"
1,"I am sorry to say that the Amazon is not helping me to replace the product,  I know product is ok but it's not compatible to me and this can be fairly good to return it.Kindly help me for the same"
1,i hardly took 20 prints in of blackand 5 prints of colour .. and now low cartidge indication is happening..u people have given used cartidges.. how can cartidge finish in so less prints..better not to take this kind of printeri have done a mistake i think by taking this printer
1,"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.  It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly.  First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.  I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer."
1,"Printer worked fine for the first few weeks, then suddenly it stopped working and required me to setup the printer again - when setting up the printer it requires you to use ""SETUP"" cartridges that come with the package, when I had to redo the setup even though I've used the ""SETUP"" cartridges which had worked and printed documents - the printer now does not recognise them and refuses to print anything. Now it's just an expensive piece of plastic sitting on my desk, complete waste of money. Even reached out to HP support but no resolution."
1,The printer comes with a faulty cartridge which cannot be replaced through the service center. The service center people would try to avoid any issues regarding cartridges. HP customer support and chat support are useless. They would try to fool you if you contact them. The Chat executive had asked me to contact Amazon regarding the Cartridge issue on an HP printer. No service personnel assistance for setting up the printer as promised in the Amazon ad. Color print is not 100 pages as promised it is less than that. Every time the Cartridge depletes you need to substitute with a new cartridge costing Rs 747.
5,It is too automatized to troubleshoot. The HP support sucks.We do not have any troubleshooting help on the printer screen and the app errors are generic. Could get one page printed after wasting 3 days in troubleshooting. It again got stuck with another error the next day! Cannot return this anymore so stuck with this one
5,Amazing Printer Cheapest Price Wirless
1,"This Printer is very difficult to setup on a JioFiber router. Otherwise as well, my previous HP Wireless 3540 Series printer was much easier to setup on Wireless. This is just a crazy hassle, trying to connect through a SmartPhone. Please dont buy printers that have setup through a SmartPhone. It has crazy combination of buttons you have to press, to enable to Setup mode. The previous HP 3540 printer had clearly defined buttons that defined what was what."
3,It is not nearly as easy to install and use as it says. I have not been able to connect it to a JioFibre Wifi network.I use the in-built HP wifi network. I can‚Äôt print using my phone connected to the internet because my phone has to be connected to the HP wifi and not to JioFibre.I don‚Äôt know whether it is a restriction of JioFibre.
4,"1. you can print directly from any machine / mobile connected to same network2. you can also email an attachment to print from anywhere.3. it is not necessary to always change network to print.4. Mobile setup is easy, use HPeasystart setup from hp page to install in windows,  if you messed up anything, use HP print and scan doctoroverall a good buy. For new bee like me initial setup could be a pain."
1,"The cost of the product is amazingly cheap but when it comes to print quality (especially color ones) are pathetic. You would often see double lines/edges after you print it.Since the initial unit cost is less, HP has covered it nicely by comprising on the cartridge life. You need to be prepared to buy new cartridge after every 30 pages of color prints. Which does not make it value for money, especially when a branded cartidge comes at 750+ INR.I almost forgot to mention that you can't control the scanner from the mobile app. It simply doesn't support this model. The only thing you can do through this app is scan from mobile. It is not disgusting but rather a receiving product branding. Why would customer's use the app and th printer if they ultimately have to scan through the mobile? It is such a cheap business strategy and that's why HP sucks in Printing business and Cannon soars.Hence my suggestion would be, shell out more money and go for Cannon Inktank printers. I have that one , it surpasses my expectations in terms of print quality and maintenance."
1,It‚Äôs money down the drain. I‚Äôve had the printer for two months and it‚Äôs been a frustrating mess. It‚Äôs constantly smeared ink on the document or had paper jams. It‚Äôs a terrible printer. Or perhaps I just received a faulty one. It‚Äôs been a battle with HP‚Äôs customer service to get any sort of help in the matter. We‚Äôre still waiting for a technician to call us.
2,"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive."
3,"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this."
1,"I bought this printer for home use purpose but unfortunately this was not up to the mark. Its very expensive if you count Print. for Both Color and Black new cartridge - it had just given me around 50 pages print that also BW and both cartridge empty . Than i filled them with Ink because buying new cartridge is very much costly. After 2-3 refill now both the cartridge stopped working .. Till date i took around 100 to 120 Page print and believe me even if you don't have high use of Print ,, Never buy any cartridge based printer .. Never Ever.. Today i bought another printer which have ink Tank so that can be  less costly in compare with this printer.Never buy this . For me its costs around 60 rs per page  :( After just 3 month use , i am throwing this out."
3,"I have booked so many things from Amazon, thus time I got a faulty product. HP Deskjet All in one printer came early for my home usage, easy to install but paper jam issue occurred. Waiting for repairing my product by the Brand. Hope it will get cured soon. Otherwise I like to replace the item. There are options to give rating for the product, print quality, but what should I give? I don't even get any print from this newly purchased product."
1,"No extra positive point over other printer-scanner.First thing you need internet all the time for everything with this Printer.You need to download the driver, which is free, but that does not work properly, most user unfriendly software.Ink runs out just after 50 pages print.You can't just just just just scan a piece of paper without internet.Even if you provide everything to this piece of sh*t, even if the device showing ready with green mark, always shows ""Scanning is currently unavailable"".No physical button for scanning, always need to run through software, which does not work.Worst product and software by HP.I tried contacting HP many time, none of their troubleshoot worked."
3,"Most irritating part is that sometimes it doesn't print after we give a print from Windows 10 Laptop.Then on restarting the printer it start printing those prints.Haven't tried that much from Mobile but until now it has printed every time I gave print from mobile app.Good print quality for documents.Average print quality for Color Photos.Good only if usage is less, else it is irritating due to its slowness and issue of not printing every time we give a printout"
1,"Purchased this HP DeskJet 2723 All in One Wireless Inkjet Printer on 14 February from Amazon.in. It was easy for setting and first printing and scanning. After the first experience the printer was constantly making printing errors paper jams, extreme slow network printing. I am using Wifi 2.4 GHz but the data transfer from PC to printer through Wi-Fi is extremely slow. Some times I need to spend half an hour to print a single sheet by multiple time restarting and connecting.A non reliable product from HP..."
4,paper feeding is an area of improvement . ALSO there should be an inbuilt incentive to return the cartridges when fresh cartridges are delivered like a credit shell which can be utilized for next purchase.the current process is too complicated.
1,Be warned that this printer sucks like big time. It's only been 10 days and I have started facing issues with it. The printer does not spool any paper and indicates that the paper gets jammed...Feel like throwing this crap product in trash. NOT AT ALL WORTHY BUY.
1,"Installing it needs quite a patience. I had to watch couple of youtube videos to do it correctly. Its very cumbersome, took almost 90 minutes.Post installation also it shows multiple errors about paper setting, cartridge settings etc , some days its a pain to use it"
1,"This printer has wasted my time. It is horrible to setup jn laptop and once the setup is done, instead of printing, it asks to setup again. I have never been able to print a document from laptop till date.Each and every print requires multiple attempts. Finally, after struggling with it, I always end up at the xerox shop.It prints the wifi direct password and information page using colour again and again. Most of my colour ink has been wasted because of that.The HP Smart user interface needs a lottttt of improvement. It has very fixed controls like you can print only pdf files and photos. I cannot print my word docs and slides unless its converted to pdf."
4,Printing is easy. Print quality is great..Color cartridge that comes along runs out too fast. Just in 3 or 4 pagesBlack cartridge may run for 40 - 50 pagesthe cartridge refill is quite expensive compared to other hp printers.I am impressed with the wifi and smart apps linked to this printer.. however it comes with a cost.. approx INR 15 to 20 per page in cartridge
1,Very expensive  you can not take more than 100 print from 1 cartridge setAnd cartridge is not easily  available in market last 15 days i am looking and I got only 1 black and white colour cartridge is not available any where.
5,"Model : L 3152Seller : Appario RetailPrice : ‚Çπ10350Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.Before setting this up please read  comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.Recap:1. Fill the ink2. Charge the ink3. Run nozzle test (1 page)4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)5. Setup WiFi5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store6. Start printing and scanning.Hit like if helpful.üôèüèº"
1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‚Äòboth light blink‚Äô i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‚ÄòEPSON‚Äô printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it‚Äôs a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‚ÄòProblem in EPSON‚Äô."
4,"I was looking for printer for printers 10 prints a day ...so i discussed with friends. All my friends said buy anyone Epson or HP all good but buy INTANK. Hence i read everything. For my case EPSON, BROTHER were coming to best. Hence my friend was using EPSON from 4 years ..so i blindly bought it.1. Printer speed is good2. Resolution for print is good3. Cost effective4. Works wireless via phone, win, mac laptops.5. Easy to use & installI think you can blindly buy it. Warranty is 30K pages or 1 year whatever comes first.Any queries let me know.All intank printers are good but depends on use case.If you use case is Printing pics etc more ..go for Canon or HP. ElseIf color printing is not only thing ...rest all parameters EPSON/ brother are good.Go through youtube video people explains is it well"
4,"Using this printer from last almost one year . I received it on time and nicely packed.  To connect, it is not very easy because there is no digital display.,But managed. Print quality is good but speed is slow, but for average home use it is good. To refill ink it is very easy. Although I haven't refill it since purchase as I print 20-25 pages average in a week.Right after one month of purchase it had some technical problem and it stopped working.  The scanner cum xerox part of machine was faulty which need to replaced.  But I must say epson customer service was  good . Within 24 hrs technician came to my home . Although to get the faulty part it took some time , but  Epson took care of it. Technician was good and he explained me everything . Since then no other problem till date . Its works perfectly well with phone or laptop,  android or apple."
5,"I got this to print few pages since we are all working from home now. Set up was super easy, just download the software from Epson website (they give a CD but who has a CD drive anymore?). Really have nothing to complain about.Pros -1. Connecting to WIFI was easy and the printer has stayed connected for over a week. No drop in signal.2. Wake up from sleep mode and to print was really quick, was able to print the first page in less than 5 sec from the time it woke up and started printing.3. Scanner is working good, no issue there.4. Refil was easy, the ink comes in a no-spill type bottle and there is no way you can mess the refill.5. Unlike HP and other printers which use a cartridge, this one uses ink tank. Hence you dont have to fill it up fully if you print very little and not worry about ink drying up.6. App is good. You can basically do anything from the app that you can do via computer.Cons -These are not really issue as they are what defines a low end ink tank printer, but something that can be a deal breaker for few.1. No ADF, it can hold some 10 paper at a time. We need to keep adding paper2. Scans via the glass, so cant scan many pages at one go.3. Original Epson inks are not always available on Amazon. HP seems to have their products much more often and always in qtd."
5,"Initial Comments - Needed a printer that could support both windows and Mac. This one fits the bill.Pretty smooth installation for Windows - picked up my home wifi router without any issue, and the printer's own wi fi works fine as wellInstallation on mac was a bit longer - for both Mac OS 10 and Mac OS 11 - the drivers are not pre installed. You need to go to the L3150 series page on epson website and download the driver. Once installed - it picks up the printer smoothly. In less than 30 minutes - i was able to print from 2 windows laptops, 2 Macs and 3 Android mobile phones.Epson iPrint app is fairly smooth on the mobile phone. You could choose the page layouts, number of pages, etc with simple swipes.Filling in the ink is easy enough, the ink bottles are spillproof.All in all - fairly utility printer, smooth installation, and importantly worked smooth across devices.Would get to know the longevity of ink and per page cost over the usage, and would update the review later."
4,"Best all in one printer, however the printing of photoes does appear to be a little bit of low in their quality comparitively to canon and the Gsm support could be higher,Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 minOtherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competitionThe print speed is takes around 25 second for one sheet on highest quality for B/WThus a good alrounder for home use, while i would not recommend for colour printing and mainly on higher gsm"
5,Bought printer during lockdown to print school related things. Did a lot of research to decide between ink tank and ink jet. That plus advise and feedback culminated in the purchase of the 3152. And it‚Äôs awesome!The set up was very easy. Of course I didn‚Äôt read the instructions carefully so it took me a bit more time but that‚Äôs my fault. Set up was fast otherwise. I have set up the WiFi printing - in fact we only use that. Everyone in the house including the  wife and kids have learnt how to print without an issue. Initially it looked like the blank ink was finishing really fast but doesn‚Äôt look like it.Keep in mind initial head allignment will use up ink bit thereafter it‚Äôs great.Not as great as a laser obviously. And I think ink jet quality is better. But for school etc this works very well. Ink jet would not last these many prints for sure.Have been using for around 40 odd days.  The usage has been heavy due to school so not sure how it survives low usage. Did have a minor challenge in registering warranty but a quick email to Epson sorted it in no time.
5,"I have no idea what these low rating reviews are talking about, may be they got some defective product which certainly was replacable..apart from that, the product is great..working perfectly fine..had hundreds of prints in first month and it has no issues regarding prints and scanning..Photo printing quality is also great..I mean I have used L805 model as well which has 6 ink colour tanks and this one with 4 colour tanks is no lesser than that in print quality, just the thing is, you got to know which paper to use..Yeah the build quality looks little loose or lighter, but hey, you don't have to carry it in your bag, it just restes on your table and keeps printing.."
4,"Value for money for an ink tank printer and can used for home and small office needs.The print quality is good and yield is decent too.However I found the print speed below my expectations. Of course I didn't expect it to give the print per minute speeds as claimed by the manufacturer, but printing large number of pages over wifi is a pain as it takes a lot of time.One needs patience for printing high number of pages over wifi or wifi-direct.Installation is neither difficult nor easy but one can do it by himself/herself too after following the directions provided.But the installation process can be made slightly more user-friendly."
1,1st : printing quality is not good as u think2nd : not easy to use3rd : head damage very early4th : you have to call a technician every month5th: ink tank Air bubling prolem6th: paper jam problem7th: Wifi connection problemI buy 2 printers but the same problem with both
2,"I don‚Äôt recommend buying this printer... u will not unit‚Äôs not as fast as advertised.. printer stops printing in between if you switch the application and there is no print queue. Print Quality is not that great... but the interface with MacBook and iPhone is seamless with this 3152 printer... HP ink tank 419 is way way better printer than this at same price though the printing is little slow, it is better in all other aspects. u can just give parallel prints and forget, it will print and keep ready but with Epson u can‚Äôt give prints parallel it says printer is busy no option of print queue !!!!"
5,"I bought this printer during the Republic Day Sale. I needed one for home printing which was cheap to operate and use. It was received in very good packing. After seeing a couple of YouTube videos and the attached instructions I was able to install it myself. It was a breeze doing it. Using the CD was able to install and configure the printer over the WiFi connection. I also installed the Epson imprint app on my Samsung M31 and it detected the printer immediately. Now, I am able to print from both devices easily. I took a photocopy first which came out fine. I then printed some photographs (attached) which are pretty decent (though not as bright as originals but not totally unexpected). I didn't try the scan but should work fine seeing the way photocopy worked.Looking forward to using it."
3,"The installation process is not at all simple. Me being the technical guy had so much difficulty setup this printer. I then had to connect this printer with USB cable to my PC. Unable to setup the wifi part of this printer. Cant setup in the mobile with wifi direct. Scanned one image and then printed it, the print out came very faded. I m still not sure what went wrong in the installation due to which the color print out came so pathetic."
1,"I have been using this printer for couple of months now. I have another brand single function printer too, the quality of documents printer from this is not at par with other brands. The printer stops prints abruptly inbetween a print operation and WiFi direct is not reliable. I contacted technical support who inturn assigned me a service engineer who was of no help to me. Printing B&W photos gives a blue tint or greenish tint and I have retorted to online printing for the same. Some of the photographs come out with poor dynamic range whereas my old printer could handle anything thrown at it. The software is sub par and looks like some cheapish Chinese alternative softwares and not one supplied by a professional printer manufacturer. If you just want to do casual printing with a mix of photographs it's fine, if you are looking to print on a day to day basis then look elsewhere!"
3,"Print quality good most of the times but sometimes pathetic with horizontal lines....Very difficult to set up Wireless connections both connecting it to wifi and using it through wifi direct.Epson being such a big brand has bugs in its software... Anyone installing the software can know the wifi password of the laptop as it is very visible right in front after the driver is installing....Also it was an uphill task to connect it on the wifi network...Epson needs to step up their game and make installation user friendly...Furthermore, android app lacks option to print desired particular pages.... In order to print 10 different pages we need to give 10 different commands... Or else we have to use the laptop to print 10 pages in one command...."
5,"I was looking for a reasonably priced printer for home use (kids projects, occasional letters, photocopies, scanning documents) and zeroed on this model after recommendation from some of my colleagues. After using this printer for more than a month I should say I am pretty satisfied with the printer's performance.Positives - seamless wireless printing, easy set-up/ installation, convenient options for printing (low/ high/ average quality prints)Cons- none as of now, except the absence of a sorter makes things bit cumbersome (single page scan/ photocopy at a time)"
4,"Connectivity is good. I could print from my mobile, Ipad and also from Laptop. Best part is even when you are not using that regularly, Printer performed well. After staying idle for 20 days, I directly printed some photos on Gloss paper. They looked fine. You just need to adjust some sharpness in the Printer App before taking photo print.Back and forth printing is manual here but it is ok. For a home printer, it has reached my expectations."
5,"Let's point out some pros and cons...Pros:1. Prints quite fast, at about 10-15 ipm (b&w), depending upon the contents of the pages.2. Scan quality is excellent, almost like a photocopy.3. Ink consumption is very low, printed over 3k pages so far in b&w, still 1/4th of the black ink is left.4. Prints sharp and vivid images, excellent for photo printing.5. Easy to refill ink tanks with spill-proof ink bottles.6. Mobile printing (wireless) is easy to connect and use, contains most of the features of desktop printing.Cons:1. Unlike laser printers, print quality for small fonts is not very good, pixels are observed on the edges of the latters if looked closely.2. After switched on takes some time to initialize, sometimes it's annoying when you are in a hurry.3. Not a very compact design, outer parts are not so tightly attached to the body.Final conclusion: In spite of a few drawbacks it's a very efficient and smart printer for home and commercial purposes. Suitable for heavy usage (over 1000 pages per month)."
5,"When self installing the printer - You have to Charge the Ink after filling. Step 11 of Section 2 "" Charging Ink"". To do this after powering on the printer for the first time (and the power button LED has stopped blinking -  you have to Press the Triangle button for 5 Sec - The Power LED will start blinking again - This blinking will continue for 10Min - You have to wait. At end of 10 Min the Power button will stop blinking.Do not  try test print option - i.e. Press Button 1, keeping it pressed Press Button 2. -  It does not work. & in the process of trying for Test Print, it will exhaust your ink w/o printing.The Installation guide states the self filling will stop when the ink level reaches the top bar in the tank.It does not stop, instead  it fills beyond the top bar beyond the transparent window of the tank.One gets anxious if the tank will overflow. That did not happen."
5,"Great printer, was very easy to setup earlier it takes some time around 10min but then works smoothly and also the WiFi is very easy to set up,you will get a print out of your password and you need to connect your phone with your printer using that password once its done your good to go ( sorry forgot to mention please install EPSON IPRINT in your phone then you can be able to print using the WiFi from your phone)"
5,"Even though I'm a technology literate, I chose to call the official Epson engineer to install the printer and they visited within 24 hours.Installation process was very smooth and print quality is good enough for a regular home user who needs a print here and there.Printer is easy to install, ink is enough for filling up the tanks well. WiFi is easy to connect and it a smooth ride to print from laptop or phones.I recommend using Epson I Print app for ease."
4,"Giving it a 4 star because it has driver issues while connected via USB in windows 10, sometimes device is not recognised ( Don't Know if its  windows problem or printer problem).1. You can see the printing quality from the above pictures (Printed on normal A4 paper, quality may improve on Glossy paper).2. Free installation done within 2 days.3. Scanner quality is awesome.4. Ink cost is low compared to other printers.Note :- I will update the review after 90 day use,about customer support and any other technical issues."
2,"Writing this after almost 10 months of usage.The printer has frequent connectivity issues - it gives a communication error and becomes offline. Logged a complaint a few months back and the service engineer fixed the problem with some firmware updates.Started facing the same issue again for the last few days. It does print after a few tries but the scan option is just not working.Tried logging a complaint with Epson today, but to my surprise, they don't have any details of my printer [purchase date, serial number etc] and informed me that its out of warranty [It has almost 2 more months of warranty as per the invoice date].I was asked to send a mail with invoice copy and other details for warranty updation, and now have to wait for them to update in their systems; with no commit on how long it will take.Really clumsy and unprofessional on their part.Would recommend to go for alternate options if you can. I personally have had very good experience with my HP desk jet before.On the plus side, the print quality is good in B/W and acceptable in colour. The one big advantage is the lower cost of printing which comes with the ink Tank option."
3,"This is a decent printer that with a poor interface and buggy software especially for Mac users. The app is also not very good and in fact I regretted changing to this printer.The primary reason for changing was to have cheaper printing due to ink tank technology and that part works well.Here are some issues1. No duplex printing for Mac and manual for Windows2. Poor software that‚Äôs not intuitive3. If pages get over in between a print, the command has to be given again as it forgets the remaining pages.4. No screen in the printer so connecting to WiFi etc take some efforts.Not recommendedPM"
5,"From my two months usage experience,Pros: Easy to install and setup. WiFi direct and thru existing WiFi network options are available. Also you can print on the go from your mobile(ios&android). Easy to fill ink tank. Fast printing and decent quality output.Con: Build quality, paper feeder and output trays are very flimsy though solves the purpose without any issues."
3,"Delivery from Amazon was prompt.Installing the printer is breeze. The information pamphlet provides the steps to be followed and it took around 15-20 minutes to complete it. Configured WIFI-Direct option and have been using it with the Epson iPrint app. The quality of printout looks decent. Tried both colour and monochrome. Copy function is working well too. Have not tried the scan option and printing photos.To the not so good part, the build quality is simply plastic nothing much to mention here.And, they have mentioned that any non-genuine or non-epson ink may cause damages which is not covered by Epson warranties."
2,"Unable to get a print out copy. Unable to get the test page print. Thin plastic sheets compartments, afraid they will easily break  Old hp printer designed much betterbut 802print cartridges too expensive And hp personnel interfering with hp printer over internet."
1,"Rating 1 start because of their unprofessional customer support and low-quality product which didn't work for 10-12 months.I would say you can buy EPSON, only if you know how to repair printers. Else the EPSON customer support will give you hard time and also ask for advance payment into some unknown individual account to get it fixed. BETTER NOT TO BUY EPSON Printers."
5,"Fantastic printer for home use with online classes going on.A few features that I find mentionable:1. Super compact, fits even into a small area easily2. Print quality for regular prints is great3. Cost wise very reasonable to buy and also print on ongoing basis4. Wifi and WiFi direct makes it very easy to print from any device from anywhere in the house5. Yet to print photos on photo paper so don't know how that would come out. But printing photos on regular paper came out okayish"
4,Bought this printer after a lot of research...Pro:1. Wireless2. Good Print Quality3. Economical on Ink (Ink tank)Con:1. The WIFI configuration is time-consuming2. Some ink spill from the bottle (not the Printer)3. Scanner scans only A4 ...size upto legal would have been better.
4,Product received was nicely packed and received on time. I couldn't install or operate the system because delivered product was not working and required to call technical support team. Thank God they attended my phone call and solved the major problem by replacing its motherboard.I highly suggest that please never try to purchase this item through online. Please always purchase after proper checking from authorized dealers onlySamrom Lugun
2,"My name is SudhakarEpson 3152 printer is very good but very poor quality. Most of the ink is wasted after the printer is initially turned on. Also many times it takes more time to print. The printer I bought recently has a lot of errors. The first of which. Printhead Problem All the lines in the print are coming out. That does not mean that all printers are laid out. Sometimes it can even happen by transport. In any case, I think it's much better to buy on Amazon. The problem can be solved very easily in a very short time."
1,"Even after 2 hours of installation, doesn't print a single page.There is no such thing as customer satisfaction once you buy it, they will run with your money like thieves.Just dont buy, it doesnt print anything and Amazon or Epson won't take it back even if you call them within 3 hours of delivery."
1,I would like to point out following major issues experienced by me.1.0 I received the invoice without GST number being business invoice. Could not get any help through customer care as there was no direct number to reach the executive. It was all through auto voice and helpless. Please send an invoice to my email ID with the GST number given2.0 The printing quality is very pathetic. Kindly provide the direct customer care help line to redress the technical issue.
5,"First thing I checked is where is it manufactured, glad to find it is made in Phillipines. Setup was simple, some YouTube videos helped. Print quality is good and printer is simple to use. The application downloaded on mobile works like a charm via Wi-Fi. It is very light weight, and build quality could had been better. Found plastic flaps delicate and need to be handled carefully."
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ‚Çπ2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) üëåüëåüòÄI have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also there was no external packaging done on this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it‚Äôs a very of so let product
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
1,This product is a scam because it‚Äôs ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don‚Äôt get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
1,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.Think well before you buy this printer."
4,Very good product for day to day use...not for commercial purpose... Must have device in every home...Its print quality is good.but it take time to print... Overall it is quite durable and easy to install...
1,"Guys, if you see the tag bestseller and are buying it please research first. It is very tough to use never gets connected easily. 1st time it worked well and then it never ever worked seamlessly, it always had an issue of connection or ink etc. As soon as i used, it got over in hardly 40 pages and i thought something might be the issue, however second time the same thing happened third time again  .. i called hp people and they told me it is only good for some occasional printing ...like 1 or 2 page occasionally. If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2. I am extremely displeased with the product as i believed in hp products... so if you have to print 1 or 2 pages you can go for and then also 1000 bucks for 40 pages is the worst investment you'll ever do..."
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
5,"I originally bought a HP printer and had a seriously hard time trying to get it working with Windows, Mac and Linux computers I had. One HP software would detect the printer and would ask me to install HP smart which would just fail to detect printer and ask me to connect it even when it's connected just fine.Canon on the other hand was a breeze. You don't even need any additional fancy software to work with it. Windows works out of the box and for M1 Mac, I was able to get it working just fine on Big Sur by using the driver ""MG2500 series CUPS Printer Driver Ver. 16.40.1.0 (Mac)""There are cost concerns compared to HP with cost of cartridge, but I'd gladly pay more for the cost if it means good compatibility as I really don't want my mom to struggle with her printing setup with some proprietary 3rd party buggy software that HP expects you to use.Canon integrated nicely with the OS and even passes error messages on the OS level directly so that you know what's wrong and even opens a browser tab with a guide on how to fix whatever it missing.The software is just excellent and I'd recommend everyone to buy Canon printers for home use. They're just better."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Good printer.I bought it for ‚Çπ2000/- only and had got ‚Çπ700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ‚Çπ1300/- .Prints pages at ‚Çπ0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that‚Äôs how all the cartridges are. I‚Äôll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I‚Äôm still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I‚Äôll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
3,"Printer is good in quality printing and scanning even it's easy to use But cost of ink with its validity is very poor , so it cost very much for printing one papar and ink only last for 50 page printing on black white and colour. Also this printer have no wifi and Bluetooth connectivity hence we need to use wired-computer for printing and scanning.But as a emergency tool in home this is useful for  scanning and sometimes printing important and needy documents. So it was very useful for me during COVID19 lockdowns"
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,"Product received one day early, but colour printing error showing and the carriage not compitable error coming. Another important thing, I ordered the item on 22.01.2019 and received on 26.01.2019, but warrenty showing only 4 months balance in HP official site, that means it may be an old return product. I trying to replacement but no option in Amazon. Then I contacted customer care over phone and send photos for proof of warranty. I tried to HP site for warranty dispute , but the site is not working. Totally disappointed in this purchase.So please replace the item at the earliest with a new one and stop making this type of issues to customers.ThanksAfter two I got new one piece, working satisfactory. Thanks Amazon."
1,This product is very good. But this type of ink are very poor. I m not satisfied. Photo print is very very poor and there is blow off.......
4,No WiFi as mentioned.customer services are very good.
4,"This review i am writing after 3 days of usage...I suggest printer demo is required if u r first time purchasing printers or u can call HP customer care for any help regarding printer.1)  Printer quality is Good....  I used Photo sheets 210GSM for photos... When we r printing photos we need to change which type of sheets we r using. Then colour photos clarity will be good.2) Text messages or mail printouts  A4  size black and white print is also good.3) Many people review say that warranty is for 3 or 6 months....  Its false information....  As we purchase  printers, we get GST bills....  Based on purchase date u r warranty will start.4) Some people have giving Printer head was not working....  Its manufacture defects...  We have warranty we can call customer care and solve the issue. We can't blame Amazon for everything.5) Scan print is not so good....  I rate 4 star for scan printouts.  Other printouts r very nice...I am satisfied with this printer.....  If u need Wi-Fi then go for HP 410....."
4,"This printer has a lot of mixed reviews. Everybody praised Epson and Brother. But there are many advantages to this printer which i will mention below:1. Printer Heads are detachable and can be fitted yourself. The price of each printer head is also significantly lesser than of Epson, Canon and Brother.2. Total 4 buttons - one to cancel. one to pull/re-pull pages. one to colour copy and one to do B&W copy. The copy function is very simple. It will scan and print in one touch. No need to scan separately and print separately.This makes it very simple and easy.3. HP support and availablility. This is its biggest strength. Printer installation and demo done in 1 day. Product is of last year, hence called HP support to update the warranty according to purchase, done in 2 days flat.4. For home printing needs, speed of printing is okay for me. Prints about 7-8 pages per minute. First page print takes longer, i guess the printer takes time to warm up. It becomes quicker after that.5. Paper quality also decides the quality of print. A colour print on a rough A4 sheet and a glossy photo paper is very very different. It is not fair to compare both.6. Super easy to install and operate yourself. One youtube video is enough. Everything has a slot and there is nothing that can go wrong. Even ink is spill free.Cons:As said by other reviewers here, it is not as fast as Epson or Brother.It is light weight and plastics are flimsy. So rough and careless usage may break or crack parts."
4,"I was looking for a printer which would allow me to take printouts at very affordable prices. Initially I was thinking about buying a normal inkjet printer but the main problem with them is the cost of printing per page. And the inkjet cartridges are also very expensive and get finished very soon. Then I thought of buying a laser printer because they were fast and per page printing cost was also very low but the main problem with laser printers are that they are expensive and most of them can't be used for colour printing. Then I came to know about the ink tank printers which seemed a modified version of inkjet printers. I looked up on the internet about it and most of the results showed positive reviews about these ink tank printers. Hence, I decided to buy this printer for me. Aftera a week's usage I'm penning down the pros and cons of this printer below,Pros,1. Very low printing cost per page. (10 paise for black n white and 20 paise for colour printouts).2. 4 ink bottles (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) are already provided with the printer which should last around one year if used moderately.3. Very much ink efficient compared to a normal inkjet printer. One can print upto 4000 pages of black n white printouts and 6000 pages of colour printouts with the bottles already given along with this printer.4. The printing speed is moderate if used for normal colour printing. If used in echo mode, then the printing becomes even faster ! It can print upto 20 black n white pages and 8-10 colour pages in a minute in echo mode. In normal mode the speed will slightly decrease. It takes around 2-3 minutes to print a colour saturated image or poster on a photo paper which is quite fast.5. Very easy and user friendly buttons are provided for controlling the printer for novice users.Now let's talk about it's cons,1. It's not a wireless printer. Hence you can't print from anywhere, the printer has to be connected to a PC/laptop via a USB cable. This makes it little difficult to take printouts using a mobile phone (although OTG can be used).2. No auto duplex printing. It cannot print on both sides of a paper automatically.3. The initial setup and assembly of the printer is quite complex and may be intimidating for a first time user. It's best to call an official HP support person to do the setup and installation.Last but not the least, keep the following points in mind before buying this or any other ink tank printer,1. Buy ink tank printers if and only if you're going to print very frequently. If you don't print regularly then don't buy such printers because the inks will dry up if you leave it unused for a long time. You've to print at least 3-4 times in a week to keep the ink from drying.2. Although the printing cost of such printers are very less, you've to be careful about it's initial pricing. The primary cost of such printers are much higher although it'll benefit you in the long run.3. It uses liquid ink in the ink tanks, hence do not move our disturb the printer frequently because it may cause bubble formation inside the ink tanks and that'll damage the printheads. Printheads are not cheap to replace so keep this thing in mind.That's all folks. I hope this review helps you guys to decide whether to buy this printer or not."
4,Print quality is ok.It took me 3 minutes to print A4 size photo sheet. N it is ok to take that much time.If we get that print in short time we will touch that printed area then colours on that photo will be spreaded allover on that photo.So immediately don't touch photos after getting them printed. let it dry for sometime then it is ok to touch printed area.I got this printer for 8370 in amazon great indian sale.N difference between 410 n 310 is only wifi option. In my opinion btr to by this printer itself. u r getting cable to print from mobile itself. N it is esay to Operate with our mobile. Till now didn't used their tech support. Installed this printer by seeing YouTube videos. If u don't know how to install the same then for sure take their tech support.
5,"genuine HP brand printer works best quality prints ,easy to operate and best software from HP to install in PC . value for money"
1,Did not expect such a low quality from HP. Also warranty started 5 months before I bought. Still trying to sort out warranty issue. Cartridge jam in just 20 days.
5,Hp ink tank 310 model works fine. Low noise while printing.
1,"Pls dont sell hp printers through amazon hp printer is pulling down goodwill of amazon,after sale service of hp is very very worst,no installation till now delivered on- 24/1,installation req on-25/1 today- 30/1,and also said that your warranty is only for 10 month instead of 12 months,worst worsttttt."
5,"I had been using Canon pixma MP287 for more than 5 years. But the loud clattering sound right from day 1 of purchase had been unbearable, but HP310 has been far far better in following respects.1.Most silent printing2. Faster printing & scanning.3. Beautiful printing quality.4.Contast,brightness etc of the colour printcan be adjusted as per your requirement though exact colour may not be achieved."
1,"Bought for 7649/- on 10th May. The print quality is good only on A4 size papers for document printing. When it comes to photo printing on photo paper the colors are not drying quickly. Especially black color is not sticking to the paper at all. I tried with several photo papers. The colors can be washed away even with gently finger rub even after 5 hours in this hot sun(45 c Hyderabad). Hence I don`t suggest this printer for photo printing. Better go for Epson. Otherwise the printer is user friendly and easy to install. I am disappointed with photo printing issues and quality of printing. However, for the price I paid I am not that happy."
4,Good printerBest in its segment and price range.No issue in official useOnly issue in photo printing by its light print and ink is removed by washing.All ink tank are same. No difference. I can see epson also. I give 5 star if its print is some dark col.
1,Installation problem every 48hrs once we should do install.Device supporting problem happening.It's giving only 3000pages only same cost canon Epson printers giving 7000pages.
4,"1.Print quality of HP is better than of Epson.2. Epson gives better plastic body that of HP.3. Epson gives us low maintenance cost printer.4. In Hp we get  ink tank attached to the printer but Epson doesn't.5. The way, Hp takes to cover the printer's inner portion, is great. Epson printer's inner portion get more dusty that of HP printer.6. In my eye, in business purpose hp is good for colour photo print. Epson will go for xerox or other normal print out.7. It is too hard to get a original ink in online."
5,"PRINTING QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, ONLY ONCE FOUND INK FLOW GOT DISTARBED WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT AFTER 3-4 DAYS BREAK, BUT SURPRISINGLY IT CORRECTED IT SELF ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY I GOT FINE PRINT AT SECOND ATTEMPT( MACHINE SELF DETERMINED) ITS PREVIOUS PAGE WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INK FLOW. ONE SHOULD REMEMBER INK COST IS HIGH FOR THIS PRINTER. HOPE THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN."
4,"For those who don't know how to set this up, follow these (its pretty easy)IMPORTANT STEPS (FAILING TO PERFORM THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR PRINTER)1. Remove cardboard protectors inside the printer by opening front hatch.2. After opening front hatch (not the scanner), you will see a orange bolt assembly. Slide that and bring it in the middle.3. When the bolt attached assembly is in the middle, turn the bolt right side (its okay you can use force for a bit). The bolt will pop out off the assembly, we won't need the bolt again to set up the printer (but keep it aside).4. Unpack the print heads, and push the tricolour printhead on the left, and black printhead on the right (black printhead will require some extra push to get inside). After they r secured, close the blue hatch (tip top mechanism).5. DO NOT SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY TO ITS INITIAL POSITION AGAIN, machine will do it itself. Close the black covers and that's it.6. Start filling up your ink tank. You must fill all of the ink tanks not just one. Remember you dont have to completely fill it, mind the minimum level and the ink level should be above that but not necessarily on the maximum level. As for the ink bottles, remove the white cap completely and break the seal, DO NOT DAMAGE THE BOTTLE NUZZLE JAM, it workes like a vulve.STARTING UP YOUR MACHINE1. Connect the machine to power. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE PC YET! Turn on power button, printer will start ink priming now and make some Conjuring 3 noises (its normal).2. Pull out paper loading tray from the back of the printer. Use A4 paper, slide the blue hook to left load the paper (keep the paper stack to right side. Not in the middle, not in the left, but in the right). Secure the paper pulling blue hook to the right again.3. If you see any blinking icon (any) in the control panel, push and hold resume button for 3 seconds and you're almost done.4. Printer will print 2 pages at first automatically. Open the scanner, allign any one of the pages on the glass (printed side faces the glass) in the bottom right corner. Close the scanner and press the colour copy button once. Printer will copy the page (first 2-3 printouts maybe weird no need to panic). Now your printer finished ink priming completely.5. Connect it to your PC now. Download HP smart app from Microsoft store (its completely free). And if you have already f*ked up the windows update just like me then, my friend, you have to re-install your windows.6. Once HP smart app is installed create your account and that's it use its interface to print normally, make sure you're using proper page size.You're welcome!"
1,"Now this is my Third complain1.Techzart Smart watch returned to seller without informing me..Delivery boy told he ll come next day and deliver.2.Nokia 3310,i gifted to my grandmother.One switch was not working..So faulty product..3.HP inktank 310..print head was not working..it was delivered on time but after installation it showed print head error..Again supplying faulty product.Amazon team and Amazon product becoming risky to purchase nowadays."
3,"Product is good. But no Installation service provided till now, If HP is not proving Installation then how can they provide after sale warranty.Overall product is good.Printing through Laptop/ computer is very fast ( Takes max. 10-15seconds for one color print )Printer through Mobile is very slow ( takes around 3minutes for one color print)I have installed it by myself by the help of youtube videos, otherwise its very difficult to install for a new person.Printing quality is average.Built Quality is below average.Design is compact.Ink Consumption is high, My black Ink is 50% in a tank now (with max 200 prints)Other Color inks are 70-75% remaining  ( with same max. 200 prints)"
1,"I bought this printer on 03rd May. When checked with HP website for warranty, it was showing  that already 6 months the printer warrant is finished and only 6 months warranty is left.I contacted Amazon and explained about the issues. They immediately sent an replacement. With the replacement order also the same issue.Warranty already started on 01-Dec-18 and only 6 months warranty left. Also, the serial number mentioned on the Invoice was also wrong. I struggled a lot to get it rectified. Poor and pathetic support was the gift I got it.Be careful with the purchase of this printer"
5,"The printer was recd in time on 25 jan 2019 well packed Installation was carried out on 29 jan 2019 satisfactorily. However, on 31 jan when I started the first print, the movement of paper was sluggish and incomplete and error message indicating black printhead problem was seen. Informed HP who have raised a complaint and also informed it could possible a case of DOA!.Will get in touch on ce the technician attends to it."
5,"Product is very good, easy to install and use. In a minute you can print 10 page full colour and 25 page black and white.I didn't get printer invoice and warranty card with this printer."
5,"Using from oct 2020,1) Print quality is good.2) Plastic material is sturdy though printer is very light weight.3) Printing speed is acceptable.  While purchasing I was confused between ink tank & inkjet printer as latter is low-cost, but saw & heard reviews about inkjet's high operating cost (though ink can be injected in cartridge but it seldom works & can damage printer).My concern before purchasing was what if printer is left unused for long duration & to my surprise it works quiet well as I didn't use it for 1-2 months on 2 occasions (this is not the case with inkjet printers, you'll have to replace cartridge).  Installation & operation is also easy.  Though upfront cost is higher but economical in long term.Overall excellent for students & useful for small office."
1,Hi Team. I bought this product on 30 sep 2019 and I have problems with printer cartridge and while I check the warranty it says already expired during may only. But when I purchased it was having 1 year warranty. This not being supported by HP nor Amazon. I am unable reach Amazon customer care... this is really worst service and wrong committment.  I am a regular customer of Amazon and this kind of cheating was  never expected. Now I have to get this repaired myself. So any of you whole buying HP products on Amazon please check the warranty properly
1,don't purchase anything from HP because i think this is Chinese company now so they don't you provide after sale service after all i purchased this printer in June month printer works for 2-3 months in good condition but after that printer started to give very slow printing after tracing one month to my complaint to HP they closed the complaint with saying printer is working fine even i proved that printing is slow before their engineer and their excutive tasted on their same own printer in their service center and admitted that problem. karlo bagh delhi service center is pathetic. printing speed will become below half which company claim after some heavy usage so dont buy this model and even i suggest dont buy any model from hp service is pathetic
1,I purchased this hp printer due to my experience with hp but this time hp and amazon both disappointed me. HP don't bother about installation of online purchased items. After many efforts I was able to book request for installation. Person assigned installation didn't call me and reported that I didn't pick phone. Some other official blamed me outrightly for this without confirming the facts. Instead of evolving a system to overcome deficiencies hp is supporting it's erring officials. Thinking to return as now I think hp will not support is any issue of warranty arises.
1,"I recommend everyone who purchases this, should first check invoices,p-slip,order summary etc. Otherwise you would be fooled/cheated.I'd purchased this printer on 29thSep2019 upon checking I found that Manufacture Warranty End Date is 14Nov2019(so damn sure it's old product, not even 2 months). I thought, as it's working fine later I could raise dispute with HP I could extend the warranty period providing invoices etc.Now comes the agony when checked, serial number is p-slip is invalid and doesn't match with that of the device(They've noted it as 'New Serial Number' in p-slip). Due to this you can't have warranty service from HP. Now if you go back to amazon support reporting this issue, they keep us waiting endlessly without a resolution and your 1yr purchase period gets over and warranty period is expired.So if you have to service the printer, you cannot have it under warranty. And thus my printer is unusable since 1 month."
3,"Delivery was prompt. Packaging was good.Installation was smooth. I installed it on Mac. Generally use wired rather than wifi. So convenient for me.I noticed that the ink does dry up after some time if not used. It also affects the printout quality.Scanning is very bad. Because the lid is very light, for scanning, it cannot press the paper by itself appropriately. You need to press the lid explicitly to have good scan quality. It is over and above the psi mentioned while scanning."
5,"Used For several days and wrote review.Pros:1.Easy to Install2. As u know its ink tank so no stress for ink usage.3. Fast with scan and copy4. Fast with PC.5. Best in this price range.(Don't overexpect).6. Hassle Free Ink Filling.(Easy, with valves to avoid spilling).7. All in one Print, scan ,copyCons:1. Very slow with Mobile phone OTG using HP print service app(official).Overall best printer at its price range must go for it."
4,"After making all searches for almost two months during this lockdown, finally come to conclusion, to purchase the printer which is available and affordable with cost of printer and cost per page of printing (b&w & color). Was confused to either go for HP or Epson. First wanted to go for only printer and not all in one, but for few thousand rupees, feels better to have AIO option incase future needs arise.Pros:1. Easy to install (after seeing some youtube videos), inserting ink in tank is super easy, no waste of ink, hands clean.2. Print quality was good.Cons:1. I tried to use OTG cable with mobile to take print but cannot print with HP Smart app, as the printer is not at all detectable in HP Smart app. Spoken to hp service, they also said this print is not supportive to OTG-Mobile use. But after searching few more option such Printershare which is paid version but finally tried nokoprint  and it solved the issue with nokoprint. So only regret that HP original software cannot give printing solution via mobile. Request them to work on it.I will make further review after few months."
4,As usual Hp blacktext prints are crisper than epson  and are better. The black ink does not wash off with rain water (tested on rain water ) .as a office printer  does everything . I do miss the wireless function at 7400 i am happy with the purchase . printed a whole page photo print on  5 rs desmat photo paper . print does not scrap away as reviewed by others. Photo print is not as best as epson but i can say its 90 % of epson photo print .  1 issue i had that the warranty showed to be 4 months  left only  which nearly gave me a heart attack . i have my friends at Iqor which are the service providers of Hp laptops & printers and they assured me the warranty  starts with the  gst bill . ( On the safe side i asked for an installation and the warranty date got rectified .)
1,"This printer has given me nothing but headaches! Just after 3 months of use and less than 50 print outs, both cartridge got damaged. Since it was on warranty, they serviced it free of cost. Exactly one year after purchase, the paper feeding mechanism has become faulty. Also, the print of low quality and very slow. I think they have supplied me a defective piece when I got it in Diwali offer (Rs 7999)."
5,"If you are looking for some printer which has high quality prints, and operation cost is low, ink tank printers are the choice you should consider. Also, Ink tanks printer don't dry up even when not used for sometime. The filling of ink is also something which is spill proof. So overall and a very good purchase."
5,I knew well that HP was a good company and it proved again!! Superb print quality. Only disadvantage is that it has no adjust feature to control black and colour print. Xeroxes are  good. Any colour they give. Superb model.... Easy to install. I printed over 100 pages in 3 days and only 2ml of black was used. Ink quality very good. Worth of its price!Stay Home And Stay Safe. Buy HP without any thought! üôèüôèüòÉ
4,"Nice printer, giving one star less as it's only 1 week of using"
3,Worst HP support.... No one will come for installation or for tech assist. Print quality is better. But while printing from web page of from email the font is too low and just get printer in a corner of a a4 and no way you can change the font size. That menu option will not be available while printing from web. But printing from MS word is OK. No tech can fix this even assisted almost 10 Times with remote support. But they won send a tech to home also.... On site warranty is just fake.
4,Going through some reviews it was a bit disappointing at first but after some research I found it satisfied enough to go ahead and order it. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to install it. All you need to do is Dowload 100 + mb printer software and you're done. Took 40-45 minutes to complete the process. Only hope that it's economical in the long run. (fingers crossed)
5,We bought this printer 15 days back. It's a good one. Ita got scanner n printing option. we tried printing on a photo paper the print was good but it leaves a black soot kind of thing after sometime on the surface. Not sure it's the same with other brand.  Other than tat its good.We installed the printer on own.The person who was assigned to instal dint help us in anyway. While unboxing he kept on saying without a CD I won't touch it even after informing tat it's not needed and also not included in the box n he left. Other representative was helpful on the phone n helped us.The printer is good.
3,"A good product - - poor service.Printer is good, build quality is well enough. But please ensure not to load too many sheets in the tray, else they might get jammed.Service wise, Amazon is too bad in terms od service. The seller shipped the product with incorrect serial number, today I'm trying third time to get this one fixed with Amazon support. All they do is just send a so called note to the seller and ask me to wait and check my mail some time later.Support by HP is also not as expected. Don't try their whatsapp support, it literally sucks. My printer got jammed, I read online help, and fixed it all by my own. They reverted via whatsapp after 3 days."
1,Epson L3110 printer is not good its worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper setting is problem West your money Epson service center said about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this model i safar this
4,This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer7) follow the process as in the CD.Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.
5,"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly."
1,"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON  L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of  getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience  specially when you have a lots of  color copies to do.PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm.  ONE MORE major  problem is print head need  to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the  EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes."
1,Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..
1,"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money."
4,I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printerPros1.Epson customer service is very good2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp andCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canonCons:-1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb versionAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the appI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpfulAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon
4,"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate."
1,Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good printDaily you have to do head cleaningNo worth of buying this
5,"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottleüòú5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing headWill post a long term review after few months"
1,Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.
2,Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........
1,Pathetic support...Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....Disappointed with EPSON....
1,"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning"
1,"This product has had a lot of defects with the print quality and the print heads. In the 6 months since I have bought it, I have had to call Epson Service 5-6 times. They changed the inner motherboard once and have cleaned the print heads, nozzles and the connections multiple times Everytime they come. 3/4ths of the black ink has gone into this without any left over for printing. When I asked for in warranty replacement, Epson refused. It has been less than a month since the last Service and again the black cartridge is not printing. Lost time, effort and almost 11K Rupees because of this product. Never works when a printout is required.Defective product but worst service and warranty maintenance by Epson. Never buying from Epson again."
5,"Bought it almost 4 months ago and I must say, this is a very good printer. Effortless to use and One thing I must mention is that, it printed way more than my expectation.The print quality is superb, both in black and white, color copy.The printer is made and designed in such a way that, it uses ink in a very optimal way letting the users print more pages.Easy to use and install the drives. The technical support is also very good I must say.Call the customer support, and they come in no time to get your problem solved.I would like to mention that, always use original EPSON ink as it will increase the life span of the printer and also the print quality will be very good.Use papers with thickness 70 GSM or more to get the best results.Excellent for home, office use. I almost print 1200-1500 prints a month and have no complains with the printer. SO anyone looking for a color printer cum scanner should buy this.I bet, you wont regret buying this printer."
1,"Not even a year of purchase. Already has caused issues twice.Issue:- While printing,paper went back and got jammed. Worst part is yet to come...1) When raised an issue with customer care, the service person thinks that I'm mad and I have done something. He was not ready to accept that it is product defect. Finally convinced him and he had open the printer to remove the jammed paper.2) Issue has arrived again now and paper has got jammed. Eager to see service executive response this time.Moral:- I would suggest not to buy this.Disclaimer:- I'm not a newbie to printer, I had been using cartridge printer before buying this one. I had no issues with that even after 3 years of using and still have no issues with that cartridge printer."
5,"The printer is very good and value for money.I see people dissing on printer they haven't even enjoyed good prints. Well actually I had some very good prints since the start. The process is simple to setup only if you read the instructions. You get drivers easily from epson website and setup is very easy. I also got the printer to work with a CUPS printer server on ubuntu and it seams to do the job just right.Cons:Instructions and Ink filling which takes about a 10 mins to do.Pros:Good output.No Ink head jamming till now even though i don't print very often.Prints well on thick and thin paper.Easy photocopyWorks on LinuxCan be easily shared on network and you can even use your mobile phone connected to network for printing.(Only using another server that runs CUPS Print Server , you can use Raspberry Pie also.)Overall the printer is good and worth its price.Don't focus on those hate reviews they did a lot of things wrong when setting up hence they cannot get the printer working."
4,"It is delivered today. I went through the installation set up looking you tube video as customer support person is not allowed to visit my house due to restriction imposed for outsiders to enter our society premises.The installation process is very smooth and it takes around 10 minutes for ink charging. I installed required printer utility on my Linux and took some print and scan. The picture quality is very good and also same picture quality of photocopies.As per some you tube videos, this printer has very short life span. Usually printer head problem occurs after 1-2 years."
2,"Brought in Dec 2020, worked for six months and then scanner does not connect, same machine, still prints and copies but the scanner, that part cannot connect, even with reinstall, new cable and trying to get a technician here, one visit so far and fix lasted 24 hours. Giving up on this and never again for Epson, as trying to get service is next to impossible, without even discussing warranty, who cares anymore, I just need a scanner printer that works! After six months, I am tossing and going to buy another brand. Happy with printing quality but I need something to last longer than six months! Be very careful before you buy this product or from this brand!"
5,It's a good printer for domestic purpose. Would recommend a duplex printer if one is not willing to do the odd even printing.
1,"The printer was delivered to me on 24th Aug and I called the Epson customer care for installation. Due to Covid, the installation happened a week after and the engineer told me that the parts of this printer are defected and that I must replace it with Amazon. Amazon has a 7 day replacement policy and because this didn‚Äôt get installed on time, they are refusing to take it back. I am left with a brand new printer with defects and will have to get my printer repaired by Epson. Horrible customer service by Amazon. Please think before buying such expensive items from Amazon. It is better to buy from a local supplier for a little more who ensures replacement and service."
4,"The printer is easy to install. The Ink bottles are well designed to fit into the sockets and the ink flows smoothly from them to the printer tanks. The user manual should be a little more revealing, it took me some time to realize that when alternate blinking starts, it would continue for a long time like 10  - 20 minutes.  The black bottle seems to deplete quite fast even in the standard printing mode, I have ordered an additional one and received it the day after. The pages come out fast and also dries fast.  Print quality is adequate. Color calibration is a bit off.  I would report back after using it a while."
5,"I list down the initial setup problems1. After refilling the ink color print was not working.2. After running multiple inbuilt self Head cleaning the color print started coming gradually.3. Still I was seeing missing lines as mentioned in image, then i ran 3 times the head cleaning issue was not resolved.4. I turned off the printer for 8 to 12 hours and kept idle.5. I tried printing again it was printing awesome color prints without issues.If there is a printing issues in new printer it is because of ink flow is taking time, initially I got angry and gave 1 star after running multiple self head cleaning printer is going above and beyondGiving 5 Star for the Delivery and Product"
5,After hunting for 2 days I found Epson L3110 is correct model for my requirement. It's just amazing product. Met all my requirement. Value for money. I skipped choosing WiFi model as it was around 3 to 4k more which I did not find worthy for my use.
2,The printer is good and easy to install only on Windows. Since my Primary machine is Mac I had to return it back. The support team is horrible. Call Centre is worst they can't even speak English and too busy to talk. I ended up teaching Tech Support guys who visited my home teaching the fundamentals of Mac. Tested the features on my Windows it went well. The printer is simple and good but Epson need to work on it's Software and a lot on it's Customer Support hire some good engineers and pay them well.
2,I will list out the problems with this printer1. Photocopy mode is cumbersome and takes a lot of time2. Page edges get smudged in many cases3. You cannot primt multiple pages and sometimes the printer does not print on one side causing a sync issue in case of large amounts of prints.4. The steps to service it is confusing
5,Nice printer it is very easy to instal the drivers and the papper adjecting is some difficult
5,I had reviewed a lot of printers before buying this one and I am not disappointed till now. Got it in Sale and after discount for approx 9500. Good printer for home usage and also for home-office. Only thing is I have not been able to connect the mobile app for printing and unable to figure out how to do it.
4,"I am giving review after using it couple of times. Overall performance is good. Plastic body quality is just ok, could be better. If you are use-to with IT stuff then installation wont be any issue, but if you are not familiar then you should call for installation. Print quality is very good or I would say Awesome and fast too. Does the work for which you are buying it for. A small manufacturing issue I had is that power port is loose and goes inside when I plug in the power cable. But as an IT guy I am use to such issues to fix it so not a big deal for me. But yes if the plastic would better this wont happen I guess. One more thing! don't forget to register product on Epson website for warranty within 14 days of purchase. No one will tell you or remind you to do it. I think that performance wise this is best then other company printers, Also it is an oldest ink tank technology printer company. Don't worry go for it. (I will give another review after 7 month usage and also upload detailed video for installation DIY)"
4,Got a broken Canon printer. Was very disappointed but thankfully had recorded a video during unbox. Immediately initiated a replacement through customer care service. Although had to struggle a bit during replacement but got the right product finally.
1,I have given one rating because within three months we raised 6 service requests to fix the printing issue finally they changed the motor which pulls the ink then it worked properly and Iam still observing it. I am surprised how come brand new product have motor issue.so my suggestion use the printer continuously to test. Now Iam ok but satisfied as prints are coming properly. Still I dint want to change rating. Because I struggled 3 months to fix issue
5,"So Far So Good. neat prints compared to my earlier printer Canon Pixma E470. Both in colour and B/W.Print speed is certainly not as fast as they claim, but decent for home and home office use."
4,"* Nice product, working as expected. 4.5 Stars ***** There as setup time required and it took some extra time, some youtube vedios helped* The user instructions flier (one sheet came with the printer) shall  contain additional information like ""watting time/setup time"" for the calibration of the print head. Got confused as the print head moves left-right with good amount of noise :)"
1,I have purchased the  EPSON L3110 [ Serial No- X6NY3199**] on 31st August 2021.Only 14 days later  it was leter due to BAD & WORST SERVICE & PRODUCTS OF EPSON L3110 its was not working from 14th august. 9pm...I have lunch complaints [100946245*] through voice call at 9am on 16th August But I have received from EPSON customer care attendants  are very poor & chip service..I think Epson L3110 printer is MOST POOR QUALITY  & worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper JAM setting is problem West your money Epson service center  only tried  to  avoidthe  solution..about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this brand
1,Setup was bit tedious but I could do it by following the instructions but while printing it just couldn't print any filetype. I asked for the exchange and again it had same problem. Pls DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. Do go for different brand or higher with laser printer.
1,"Every brand is going downwards for there new ink tank printers,This printer has a big issue in printing photos, it starts printing config page in between printing command printing photos on corner, that wastes time and paper also, dissappointed"
5,"This printer is one of the best printer in this price range which gives us a good quality print of both black & white and colour too. Is installing is also very easy which you can do by your own and also easy to use. In my point of view, this is the best colour printer among others in this price."
5,"Writing this review after using of 2 months of heavy use.I have a small cyber cafe and I use this printer daily regular basis. Best Economical Printer in this budget.I recommend to buy everyone.I have printed more than 400+ pages b/w and ink still remains 70% above+Color print quality is awesome.Amazon Delivery service is also quick, safe and fast. Thanks to seller and Amazon team."
1,"The slowest copy print I ever experienced, it stops and takes 30 sec to print the the second print. Need lots of patience to use thise Epson L3110. performance of the printer is not satisfactory for tree price I paid for.I would rate only 2 stars."
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
5,"I originally bought a HP printer and had a seriously hard time trying to get it working with Windows, Mac and Linux computers I had. One HP software would detect the printer and would ask me to install HP smart which would just fail to detect printer and ask me to connect it even when it's connected just fine.Canon on the other hand was a breeze. You don't even need any additional fancy software to work with it. Windows works out of the box and for M1 Mac, I was able to get it working just fine on Big Sur by using the driver ""MG2500 series CUPS Printer Driver Ver. 16.40.1.0 (Mac)""There are cost concerns compared to HP with cost of cartridge, but I'd gladly pay more for the cost if it means good compatibility as I really don't want my mom to struggle with her printing setup with some proprietary 3rd party buggy software that HP expects you to use.Canon integrated nicely with the OS and even passes error messages on the OS level directly so that you know what's wrong and even opens a browser tab with a guide on how to fix whatever it missing.The software is just excellent and I'd recommend everyone to buy Canon printers for home use. They're just better."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Good printer.I bought it for ‚Çπ2000/- only and had got ‚Çπ700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ‚Çπ1300/- .Prints pages at ‚Çπ0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that‚Äôs how all the cartridges are. I‚Äôll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I‚Äôm still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I‚Äôll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
3,"Printer is good in quality printing and scanning even it's easy to use But cost of ink with its validity is very poor , so it cost very much for printing one papar and ink only last for 50 page printing on black white and colour. Also this printer have no wifi and Bluetooth connectivity hence we need to use wired-computer for printing and scanning.But as a emergency tool in home this is useful for  scanning and sometimes printing important and needy documents. So it was very useful for me during COVID19 lockdowns"
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
1,First day first showüëéüò°Very DisappointedAs you see colour where not properly set as pictureTotally worst
3,The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving.  One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.
4,"Nice product, all function available, futuristic product, wit wifi , scanning copy, multi function.Only cons is the set up via mobile app it is easy for setup watching youtune video.But for window installation it is difficult, as it is a new printer,hence driver properly not worked, u need to take guidance to HP customer support.Hp customer support was very helpful  guided me 2 hrs & get the installation completed.Ink consumption still not rated, as 1 week only i am using , quality & usability aft insatalltion is pretty good for home use.."
1,"1) Printing SPEED per page VERY SLOW,2) PRINTING COST OF PER PAGE VERY HIGH, TOTALLY BOGUS / MISLEADING INFORMATION CIRCULATING  BY HP THROUGH FABRICATED ADVERTISEMENT REG HP PRINTER 2723 JUST TO MISGUIDE CONSUMERS/ CUSTOMERS.  HP-805 CARTRIDGE COST TOO HIGH BUT PRINT OUTPUT VERY POOR ...ONLY 25-30 Pages. ALSO 805 CARTRIDGE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE EXCEPT AMAZON. PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS SAME AS PURCHASE OF ELEPHANT FOR PERSONAL USE !!!"
1,"Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive"
1,"I am sorry to say that the Amazon is not helping me to replace the product,  I know product is ok but it's not compatible to me and this can be fairly good to return it.Kindly help me for the same"
1,i hardly took 20 prints in of blackand 5 prints of colour .. and now low cartidge indication is happening..u people have given used cartidges.. how can cartidge finish in so less prints..better not to take this kind of printeri have done a mistake i think by taking this printer
1,"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.  It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly.  First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.  I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer."
1,"Printer worked fine for the first few weeks, then suddenly it stopped working and required me to setup the printer again - when setting up the printer it requires you to use ""SETUP"" cartridges that come with the package, when I had to redo the setup even though I've used the ""SETUP"" cartridges which had worked and printed documents - the printer now does not recognise them and refuses to print anything. Now it's just an expensive piece of plastic sitting on my desk, complete waste of money. Even reached out to HP support but no resolution."
1,The printer comes with a faulty cartridge which cannot be replaced through the service center. The service center people would try to avoid any issues regarding cartridges. HP customer support and chat support are useless. They would try to fool you if you contact them. The Chat executive had asked me to contact Amazon regarding the Cartridge issue on an HP printer. No service personnel assistance for setting up the printer as promised in the Amazon ad. Color print is not 100 pages as promised it is less than that. Every time the Cartridge depletes you need to substitute with a new cartridge costing Rs 747.
5,It is too automatized to troubleshoot. The HP support sucks.We do not have any troubleshooting help on the printer screen and the app errors are generic. Could get one page printed after wasting 3 days in troubleshooting. It again got stuck with another error the next day! Cannot return this anymore so stuck with this one
5,Amazing Printer Cheapest Price Wirless
1,"This Printer is very difficult to setup on a JioFiber router. Otherwise as well, my previous HP Wireless 3540 Series printer was much easier to setup on Wireless. This is just a crazy hassle, trying to connect through a SmartPhone. Please dont buy printers that have setup through a SmartPhone. It has crazy combination of buttons you have to press, to enable to Setup mode. The previous HP 3540 printer had clearly defined buttons that defined what was what."
3,It is not nearly as easy to install and use as it says. I have not been able to connect it to a JioFibre Wifi network.I use the in-built HP wifi network. I can‚Äôt print using my phone connected to the internet because my phone has to be connected to the HP wifi and not to JioFibre.I don‚Äôt know whether it is a restriction of JioFibre.
4,"1. you can print directly from any machine / mobile connected to same network2. you can also email an attachment to print from anywhere.3. it is not necessary to always change network to print.4. Mobile setup is easy, use HPeasystart setup from hp page to install in windows,  if you messed up anything, use HP print and scan doctoroverall a good buy. For new bee like me initial setup could be a pain."
1,"The cost of the product is amazingly cheap but when it comes to print quality (especially color ones) are pathetic. You would often see double lines/edges after you print it.Since the initial unit cost is less, HP has covered it nicely by comprising on the cartridge life. You need to be prepared to buy new cartridge after every 30 pages of color prints. Which does not make it value for money, especially when a branded cartidge comes at 750+ INR.I almost forgot to mention that you can't control the scanner from the mobile app. It simply doesn't support this model. The only thing you can do through this app is scan from mobile. It is not disgusting but rather a receiving product branding. Why would customer's use the app and th printer if they ultimately have to scan through the mobile? It is such a cheap business strategy and that's why HP sucks in Printing business and Cannon soars.Hence my suggestion would be, shell out more money and go for Cannon Inktank printers. I have that one , it surpasses my expectations in terms of print quality and maintenance."
1,It‚Äôs money down the drain. I‚Äôve had the printer for two months and it‚Äôs been a frustrating mess. It‚Äôs constantly smeared ink on the document or had paper jams. It‚Äôs a terrible printer. Or perhaps I just received a faulty one. It‚Äôs been a battle with HP‚Äôs customer service to get any sort of help in the matter. We‚Äôre still waiting for a technician to call us.
2,"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive."
3,"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this."
1,"I bought this printer for home use purpose but unfortunately this was not up to the mark. Its very expensive if you count Print. for Both Color and Black new cartridge - it had just given me around 50 pages print that also BW and both cartridge empty . Than i filled them with Ink because buying new cartridge is very much costly. After 2-3 refill now both the cartridge stopped working .. Till date i took around 100 to 120 Page print and believe me even if you don't have high use of Print ,, Never buy any cartridge based printer .. Never Ever.. Today i bought another printer which have ink Tank so that can be  less costly in compare with this printer.Never buy this . For me its costs around 60 rs per page  :( After just 3 month use , i am throwing this out."
3,"I have booked so many things from Amazon, thus time I got a faulty product. HP Deskjet All in one printer came early for my home usage, easy to install but paper jam issue occurred. Waiting for repairing my product by the Brand. Hope it will get cured soon. Otherwise I like to replace the item. There are options to give rating for the product, print quality, but what should I give? I don't even get any print from this newly purchased product."
1,"No extra positive point over other printer-scanner.First thing you need internet all the time for everything with this Printer.You need to download the driver, which is free, but that does not work properly, most user unfriendly software.Ink runs out just after 50 pages print.You can't just just just just scan a piece of paper without internet.Even if you provide everything to this piece of sh*t, even if the device showing ready with green mark, always shows ""Scanning is currently unavailable"".No physical button for scanning, always need to run through software, which does not work.Worst product and software by HP.I tried contacting HP many time, none of their troubleshoot worked."
3,"Most irritating part is that sometimes it doesn't print after we give a print from Windows 10 Laptop.Then on restarting the printer it start printing those prints.Haven't tried that much from Mobile but until now it has printed every time I gave print from mobile app.Good print quality for documents.Average print quality for Color Photos.Good only if usage is less, else it is irritating due to its slowness and issue of not printing every time we give a printout"
1,"Purchased this HP DeskJet 2723 All in One Wireless Inkjet Printer on 14 February from Amazon.in. It was easy for setting and first printing and scanning. After the first experience the printer was constantly making printing errors paper jams, extreme slow network printing. I am using Wifi 2.4 GHz but the data transfer from PC to printer through Wi-Fi is extremely slow. Some times I need to spend half an hour to print a single sheet by multiple time restarting and connecting.A non reliable product from HP..."
4,paper feeding is an area of improvement . ALSO there should be an inbuilt incentive to return the cartridges when fresh cartridges are delivered like a credit shell which can be utilized for next purchase.the current process is too complicated.
1,Be warned that this printer sucks like big time. It's only been 10 days and I have started facing issues with it. The printer does not spool any paper and indicates that the paper gets jammed...Feel like throwing this crap product in trash. NOT AT ALL WORTHY BUY.
1,"Installing it needs quite a patience. I had to watch couple of youtube videos to do it correctly. Its very cumbersome, took almost 90 minutes.Post installation also it shows multiple errors about paper setting, cartridge settings etc , some days its a pain to use it"
1,"This printer has wasted my time. It is horrible to setup jn laptop and once the setup is done, instead of printing, it asks to setup again. I have never been able to print a document from laptop till date.Each and every print requires multiple attempts. Finally, after struggling with it, I always end up at the xerox shop.It prints the wifi direct password and information page using colour again and again. Most of my colour ink has been wasted because of that.The HP Smart user interface needs a lottttt of improvement. It has very fixed controls like you can print only pdf files and photos. I cannot print my word docs and slides unless its converted to pdf."
4,Printing is easy. Print quality is great..Color cartridge that comes along runs out too fast. Just in 3 or 4 pagesBlack cartridge may run for 40 - 50 pagesthe cartridge refill is quite expensive compared to other hp printers.I am impressed with the wifi and smart apps linked to this printer.. however it comes with a cost.. approx INR 15 to 20 per page in cartridge
1,Very expensive  you can not take more than 100 print from 1 cartridge setAnd cartridge is not easily  available in market last 15 days i am looking and I got only 1 black and white colour cartridge is not available any where.
3,"After using the printer for a few days, here is what I experienced:Pros:1. Unboxing and Setup was easy and quick2. Printing was fairly simple3. Black print is fast and crispCons:1. Downloading the driver was a terrible experience. The HP Website was so slow, I could finished my lunch, evening snacks and it was still downloading!2. Colour print is absolutely worst. Highly pixlated and no sharpness even after selecting best quality in the settings.3. Printed a picture of my nephew on a photo paper and after 24 hours, it hadn't dried and got smudged when touched and spoilt the whole print.Conclusion: if you are looking for home printing and if 90% of it is B&W, its an excellent printer. Its good if you wish to print color text too. However, one of the worst printer for color photo printing. I wish I had purchased Epson Ink Tank printer!"
2,Doesn't support wifi connectivity wrong details in comparison section. Only usb connectivity.
4,I am giving 4 star due to HP support staff. I bought one printer with Amazon. Item deliver on time but product is defected. I replace the item receivd another printer. Now working properly. But HP support staff said that it was PC software problem for colour defect. Not proper support from them. But Amazon deliver on time. Thank you so much
1,I am an expert in ITand this product is just garbage. When I calibrate the print heads it does not take place and prints are all distorted and of poor quality. Tried to get a replacement the same day but amazon is not letting me do so. Everytime it takes me to consult an expert and the support person repeatedly asks the same questions again and again and finally they ask to contact HP. Total waste of my money. Just a landfill now.
4,"The printer is okay till now. It came with two sealed HP cartidges- black and tricolour; four bottles of sealed HP inks, one power cord, one USB cable and a polythene cover.USB cable is smaller than the earlier versions like GT 5800 series ( smaller the USB cable, faster the connection). Installlation of cartidges is some tricky. You have to carefully remove the orange clamps by rotating the lever in arrow direction.There is no installation CD. You have to download it from HP site.In the first day, printing may not be good. It will take time for ink system to fill the cartidges.Earlier I used GT 5810, it is same to same except some minor variation.Overall the printer is good for photo print xerox, scan etc."
1,Print head error after 30 prints and 2 weeks. 3 visits to HP service center and now they want me to buy print heads as the print head which came with printer is out of warranty. Printer is under warranty.
1,"This product made in China you can expect worst quality by default,black and white print is okay. Color print is very bad. Scanning is normal. Good bye HP I am not buying your printers,scanners any more."
5,Delivered and got installed by HP team in one day.It's looking good and all functionals are decent.Even print quality is commandable.One concern I read was on the size constraints but I felt it's pretty ok.It's only occupying quarter of my study tableOverall good buy as I bought with discount for 9.9 k.
4,This product HP 315 Ink Tank Printer is a decent printer for home use. Color Scanning and Printing takes 4-5 minutes for a single print sent from a Laptop via HP Smart Desktop App. Direct Scan and Print takes 1-2 minutes. Print quality is good for the price of Rs.9400. Ensure that you have done proper printer settings for good quality print. Not recommended for Business use as it is slightly slow (almost all non-laser printers are slow only). The received product was already registered for warranty a month before I received this product. I hope the 'Appario Retail' seller has not scammed me as to who else could have registered the product a month before the customer. There is no Wifi on this model which may be a concern for some. But you can always convert such USB-based printers to wifi printers using TP-Link routers.  Overall I would rate this product as the perfect printer for home use.
1,"Print Quality is pathetic, used superior quality paper. 40% of print outs either getting stuck inside printer or torned."
4,"Print quality is very good, printer installation is very easy, but software installation takes time.Printer is latest but the drivers needed for scanner function is a later version. Few extra steps needed for full functions. Other wise very easy."
4,Print quality is not the best but good for home use. Printing speed is little slow. Installation is easy.
5,"Print quality is as expected, nice u may say, its a large Pinter, consumes space.HP Services though slow was nice.Thanks to service engineer who came to install the printer, as he replaced the faulty colour print head supplied with the Printer."
5,Print quality is good. It easy to install and repack. To some extent value for money.
4,"The prints are OK for both color and BW. They are not awesome but decent. It's a line printer, each print will take around 10-15 secs."
5,"No doubt, printer is good and prints good. The packaging was also great and satisfied with it, but there was no Amazon sticker in/on the product.And the most important thing there was no Invoice/Bill, which is always present for any small-to-small product.Satisfied by printer and highly recommends it."
3,"Color prints are not of best quality, can't produce orginal vibrant colors, always very dark, otherwise works fine."
5,"Printer is very good and fast, very economical to use. Can print from mobile also with otg cable. Print from mobile is slow but from pc very fast. Easy to use and scanning and copy also good."
5,"I love all the features of this. If you are looking for a nice printer for home use, it is good to go."
5,Printer is really good with nice options in the HP Smart App.
1,Yet to get installation support. BUY ONLY IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ENGINEER HANDY FOR INSTALLATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE REMOTE. GOOD FOR TECHNICAL CUSTOMERS.
5,Since I started working from home and my child also online school printer became essential for us. This printer is very easy to install and use. Also this gives good quality of print. It also used for scan and copy. So overall nice performance and worth putting money on it.
5,I struggled a bit during installation of the printer...
5,Nice printer. Easy to install and take printouts.
1,No proper customer service from the manufacturer hp from the product received date of Sept 11 2021 to till today.
4,THIS PRINTER IS AWESOME BUT HAVE ONE PROBLEM OF SMUDGE THE INK ON GLOSSY PAPER
1,Good printer but Amazon not provided Rs.1500/- discount inspite filing complaint????
4,Value for money
5,Printing speed is low
1,Unable to print
3,Print is very slow other wise all are average.
1,Touch problem
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.
1,"‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§π‡•à , ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ç ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§"
5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later‚úå"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,ü§£"
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"
5,Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.
4,Nice product
4,"It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %.  Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%."
2,Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online
1,Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time
3,"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over."
5,Awesome printer... Bought for only ‚Çπ1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..
1,"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges  will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp."
2,Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.
2,Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.
1,"Never buy HP printers. I did this mistake 3 times. Wasted a tonne money on cartridges and repair. The actual problem is ""HP DISABLES YOUR PRINTER remotely"" if you ever use a cartridge more than once. Especially if you refill it. They want us to buy their ridiculously expensive tiny cartridges every month! If we don't use different ones, they disable your printer. It happened to me twice while using hp inkjet printer and DeskJet printer.I bought this printer in August 2020 and it's disabled in September 2020! Due to lockdown I used a refil ink and bam!The printer was printing with the refill ink offline.As soon as I went online with printer connected to my laptop, it won't print again!!I haven't registered with HP. I thought if I don't register this won't happen. But still happened. Now I have a light blinking printer with me, which won't print.Hp is the worst."
1,"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer."
5,"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:Go to : https://www8.hp.com1.Go to support option2.Click on Softwares & drivers3.Click on printer image4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox5.Click Submit6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying."
2,"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,One cartridge prints about 30  A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printerThis has way too many problems for its costBut, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this"
3,"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant"
3,"A little about this printer:1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run."
5,"after sales service is pathetic, service center in faridabad is pathetic, useless service center, i had to wait for 25 days for replacement of defective cartridge. after sales service has to be improved, need to improve service centers.HP 2332 Deskjet Colour Printer is Superb, Fantastic, Excellent, very nice looks."
5,Excellent product with good well packed... Very very satisfied.... Print catridge cost also lower than any ink advantage catridge.... BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRINTER ONLY FROM AMAZON AS IN FLIPKART FAKE BRAND SOLD BEWARE...
5,Excellent product for home use....you can print around 120pages in black and white...and 100pages in colur...if you are rich then use new cartridges....all the times....but if you are not then...buy hp oroginal inks.....and fillup the cartridges...each time...with injection.....this will let you to print 6000 pages in 600Rs ...wherelse if you use cartridges...then you can print only 120pages in 600 rupeesThank you.
5,"Easily the best printer in this price range. Bought it for 3.1kHuge upgrade over my old printer. Fast printing speed, no smudges, extremely good print quality. The scan quality is also extremely good. Scanned images have proper color ration and reproduction.The setup took a little more time than expected. Other than that, awesome machine."
1,This was the worst printer i have ever ordered.  Please dont buy this product at all. This product's ink cartridge finishes in less than month and with less than 100 prints. And if you buy a new cartridge then it will cost approx 1300 rs if bought of hp. That means it will cost approx half of the printer. Which means 1300 rs for just 100 prints. I would rather get it photocopied from a shop instead. 13rs per page . And I'm also very disappointed in hp co. Which is producing this product.  And  please consult any printer seller about this product and you definitely won't find any advantage.Its totally not worth the money .
1,"The page started getting stuck from the very first day. Not a very good product from hp.As if having this printer is not bad enough the customer services sucks. It is like adding insult to injury. There is no way to contact seller to fix the issue, only channel of communication was Amazon's canned response chat, and that was pathetic as it didn't even give me option to list my issues.It just kept on cycling through the same responses.I'd give negative reviews if I could. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - NOT ONLY THIS PRINTER BUT THE SELLER AS WELL."
1,"Don't buy HP products. Learnt the hard way.Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions. HP customer care is absolutely pathetic. They will receive the call and pretend that they are not able to hear. So, forget any support from HP.Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.Also, preferably buy a wireless printer as that way you can try printing from your ipad or mobile other than you laptop, but for this wired dumbbox there's not much to do"
5,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well)  and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."
3,The look of the printer was great but the connection was vry poor when iwas connected to the laptop or phone . Other than the connection the remaining was great .
1,Product is not installing in my laptop. And neither I am able to replace the product nor I am getting any technical assistant help.
1,"Order was delivered in a day by Amazon. Great work. But the printer installation is so 90s work. You need to physically go to HP site, download drivers and complete the installation. Who does all this in 2021? But here, HP wants you to waste 2 hrs to do all of this. And then too, you cannot be sure that copies would be printed. Took me another 15 min to figure out why the hell scanner is working but printer is not- inspite of installing everything correctly as per the process. Absolutely disgusting. Pls don't go for this. Invest in buying somehting non-HP."
1,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn‚Äôt have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It‚Äôs the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn‚Äôt ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don‚Äôt buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."
1,The printer is worst.And not returnable or refundable.My 3100RS are wasted.Please whoever it is of you are reading this comment I request you to not buying it.Go for Epson or Canon or Brother printers instead of this.
4,"I just received my printer today. After printer set up and driver installation,  I am providing my review.  I am very happy with the packaging,  printing and xerox quality. Though scanning quality is okay, can't say it superb. To conclude,  good printer at INR 3,099/-."
4,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don‚Äôt go through but I think it‚Äôs a common software issue I‚Äôve faced with another HP deskjet printer tooI had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don‚Äôt have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
1,"Don't buy the printer, very bad experience over last two months.Update after using for few months:Print quality is getting worse despite running clean and alignment often with new cartridges.Both color and black printer cartridges cost about Rs 2500 each time since the default one that comes with printer doesn't last longer. You will end up spending several thousands of rupees on cartridges alone since this printer wastes ink and lot of pages with misprints as well as doesn't give good yield.I have been using several models of HP printers for more than 25 years.Doesn't work with Mac OS, works with Windows 10 only but takes a while to get the printer installed.Doesn't print anything some times.When it decided to print it takes forever to print a page most of the time.Doesn't get connected most of the time.Can't print resolutions above 300 most of the time.Haven't come across such basic printer in last 25 years."
4,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"
1,"The product isn't good at all. They don't have a return policy, it takes lifetime to print a copy incase it decides to print or else it doesn't majority of the times."
1,"This is about the HP AIO Desk jet printer  2332, I bought on Amazon  on 16th of Nov 2020.The claimed printer print yield is 120 pages Black & White.  Now, on 2nd of Dec'20, little over two weeks, I have so far printed about 55 pages , only text (no graphics so far) and Black and white.. and the printer reports no Black Ink.50 Pages per cartridge is atrocious; outright loot and doesn't even meet the claimed product specifications as per HP (120 pages). My print need is about 150-200 pages per month, mostly B&W.. and @ 750 per Black cartridge, every month I cannot invest Rs 1500 to Rs 2150 on Black cartridges alone... the Printer cost itself if Rs 3,000/-. HP IS LOOTING  CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. But this is too much...@ claimed print yield of 120 pages @ cartridge price of Rs 750, PP Print cost is 6.25. a local xerox company offers service at Rs 6 per page. What use is owning the printer?.stop buying HP anymore..  Loyalty doesn't pay"
5,Everything is good speed is good for black and white it takes 4 to 8 secs according to material you have to print and also depends upon quantity which you want draft normal or the high quality same for colour about 8 to 12 secs and scanner is also doing well use hp smart app for printing it is easy to use  you can buy ink from Amazon of wroth 400 and refills the cartridges easily even then buy a new cartridge of worth 8000 and after filling it prints about 120 pages and 80 colour pages one can refill. Cartridge in one minute it is very easy i print had 400 pages in one very good product when i go to buy it i also worry about the comments of another people who are saying it is bad but i think they didn't know how to use it don't worry and go for it if you are able to use it well then you find it best
5,Nice printer easy to use . Just install drivers before using in laptop . Got for only 3100 . I like the product as it is best for home usage but yes it is going to little bit costly in term of refilling.
2,"Too costly to print, with just 10-15 page of print, Bank ink is finished. Cartridge are 950 per pack which is beyond afford. This can be used for just scanning otherwise for print go with Laser or ink-tank option. Also their windows app from windows store or hp website for windows 10 is worst, not able to detect printer most of the time."
5,"About the model: HP 2332 and 2331 are same printers. The only difference is the body colour. Buy whichever is cheaper.A detailed review on the results:Everything works perfect from what I expected from this printer.Powered ON and could do a copy of my aadhaar colour copy in one button click.(Separate buttons for colour copy and b/w copy).Then, installed HP Smart application and printed (both colour and b/w).Installation gave me some troubles. After first of installation, the printer was not detected.I downloaded the HP printer drivers from different URL and installed it again.I don't know what made the change. It started working.But, I spent around 2 hours.We can scan up to A4 size documents. Allows to scan in three resolutions - 300dpi, 600dpi, 1200dpi.Scan with 300dpi itself is good.The pulling of paper is perfect - one sheet at a time in a clean way.Does not pull out more papers or no paper jam.So far I have printed around 20 colour copies, two A4 size photos and 20 b/w copies.HP smart application shows 50% colour cartridge remaining, 80% b/w cardridge remaining.Buy a third party refill ink kit (that is compatible for HP 805 cartridge).This will help reusing the cartrigde for 2 to 3 times.I printed photos on Kodak 230GSM paper. Reasonably ok quality.But, I need to print and check on other GSM paper to see if I get better results.Note: To protect the cartridges from ink drying out, they should not be left unused for more than a week's time.  In deskjet printers, Cartridges are the main challenge."
4,"Thanks Amazon and the Seller: Packing was good and delivery on time.Utility-wise, my needs are very little, like school assignment prints 2/3 time a week of 2/3 page.Light weight, decently good print and speed out.Original catridge colours are coming good.  Will have to see how this works over 3/4 months. It's just 2 weeks for me now.Saw a comment that the android app helps from mobile printing. But, the machine itself is not Wifi enabled. It is a basic colour printer, coming under Rs. 5k budget, which I got at Rs. 3.2K, I can only wish it was there."
4,I got 2 Cartridges with the Printer...one Black and One color plus I purchased one additional color Cartridge with offer...print scan and copy is very good quality for home use but for business use more good quality printer may be required...easy software installation and cartridge installation...Overall good Home use Printer in the market
4,Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.My advice is to go for a wireless one.
4,It's nice product for commercial as well as for private use...I personally used it...worth for money...but it is china made...and there is no bluetooth or wifi connectivity...so I feel this 2 disadvantages...but overall very nice product..go for it
1,"The first one I ordered came with a faulty cartridge rail, that turned on like it was going to explode. Replacement came everything worked, but broken paper feed tray. 2 small tabs that hold them broke loose. It's not made to last by the looks of it. The one print it did was dull on a brand new cartridge so I'm quite happy that Amazon has accepted the return for a refund. Kudos to Amazon customer service"
1,"I bought this just a month ago and it worked only for 10 days after that the cartridge problem started and it won't work. There is no error code that u can google or anything. It just won't print, no error no false code but it doesn't work. Really a bad product and I am not able to get service too!"
1,If there is no internet availability the scanner wont scan even though the printer is DIRECTLY connected to desktop.  The software hangs multiple times. Something urgent to print or scan then expect delays. All works fine till you reach your 2nd or 3rd cartridge then all these troubles start for software hangs
5,"Delivery was quite fast. Received the product in time. It's almost 3 months I am using this product and till now the experience is excellent.Print quality is excellent. Mostly used for A4 size printing. It Gives both options to print in grey scale and color. Was easy to install and start. Though, this is not wireless but gives to facility to scan and copy the documents and is best suited for household/school work."
4,"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future."
1,"Started malfunctioning from day one; Amazon replaced it, and the new unit has now started malfunctioning in less than 3 weeks time. As the return window is closed, we are unable to get the same replaced."
1,"Beware before purchasing.Only works in windows 10.7. if you have any other windows version or Mac os , it will not work. This is worst printer to be purchased."
4,"I did order for HP DeskJet 2332 All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer with 805 Tri-Color Original Ink Cartridge. Instead of receiving Tri-Color Cartridge, I had received Complementary Cartridge of both Black & Color Cartridge. Though I was not aware of the requirement of both cartridges for this printer, luckily received these two solved my immediate installation issue.Not sure that complementary is allowed for this item.With single or few numbers of paper in the input tray, struck up and the cross-feeding problem is noticed."
4,"It does what it says. It prints well, scans well & also copy well too. Its super easy to install. As the price is less, can't complain much but the printing cost is too high. Its good for occasional printing. I tried by printing color photos to glossy papers but the quality is not that good. Overall good experience."
3,"Printer looks premium,  gets prints faster and ecomonic. The main problem is the ink. I just took less than 20 pages and the ink got over. A new cartridge will cost u around 750rs. So for just 20 prints u have to pay 750 rs. Who will purchage for this kind of stuff. If i pay 1rs i will get a Xerox copy. The purpose of buying a printer is for our convenience.  Premium and build quality doesn't matter if the ink provided is such a rubbish. I will give 5 star for the quality of the printer and 1 star for printing."
1,"I bought it on 15th April, this was delivered on 23rd April 2021. Since then, I have hardly printed 15-20 pages and its USB wire is not working.Don't know whom to contact, I will try reaching out to HP, but you guys don't waste your money purchasing this.Thanks,"
1,Very disappointed.
1,Don't  buy it built in cartilage can't print more than  500 pages  new cartilage cost around  5000

3,Work fine with window laptop . No support mac book
1,Bad quality China item
1,It doesn't have much options for this value. We will get the best printers than this with this rate & this is non-returnable item.
1,Don't buy this if you are finding a auto duplex printer.As written in specifications it is auto duplex but in real it is manual duplex printer.
1,"Waist of money After 8-10 days printer not working, we trying to contact service center but still problem not solved need your support i want to replace this product."
1,"Very bad ,only 300-400 half bill printed  orignal cartridge not working properly"
3,"Printer is very good and reasonable price but warranty is given only for 5 months whereas it is clearly mentioned that total warranty period would be for one year. Don't know whose fault is that? Amazon,HP or the seller."
4,"it is an easy to use, good entry level printer, adequate for home use, and most routine print jobs. somewhat too high priced for what it offers."
2,No installation instructions and No CD is available for Drivers installation... Still trying to download if not so I can cancelled it
4,"Good product, very easy to use and install.Don't know about the cartridge refilling cost which will decide the complete review."
3,Good
5,"Nice printer, good printing speed and quality"

2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,"Product received one day early, but colour printing error showing and the carriage not compitable error coming. Another important thing, I ordered the item on 22.01.2019 and received on 26.01.2019, but warrenty showing only 4 months balance in HP official site, that means it may be an old return product. I trying to replacement but no option in Amazon. Then I contacted customer care over phone and send photos for proof of warranty. I tried to HP site for warranty dispute , but the site is not working. Totally disappointed in this purchase.So please replace the item at the earliest with a new one and stop making this type of issues to customers.ThanksAfter two I got new one piece, working satisfactory. Thanks Amazon."
1,This product is very good. But this type of ink are very poor. I m not satisfied. Photo print is very very poor and there is blow off.......
4,No WiFi as mentioned.customer services are very good.
4,"This review i am writing after 3 days of usage...I suggest printer demo is required if u r first time purchasing printers or u can call HP customer care for any help regarding printer.1)  Printer quality is Good....  I used Photo sheets 210GSM for photos... When we r printing photos we need to change which type of sheets we r using. Then colour photos clarity will be good.2) Text messages or mail printouts  A4  size black and white print is also good.3) Many people review say that warranty is for 3 or 6 months....  Its false information....  As we purchase  printers, we get GST bills....  Based on purchase date u r warranty will start.4) Some people have giving Printer head was not working....  Its manufacture defects...  We have warranty we can call customer care and solve the issue. We can't blame Amazon for everything.5) Scan print is not so good....  I rate 4 star for scan printouts.  Other printouts r very nice...I am satisfied with this printer.....  If u need Wi-Fi then go for HP 410....."
4,"This printer has a lot of mixed reviews. Everybody praised Epson and Brother. But there are many advantages to this printer which i will mention below:1. Printer Heads are detachable and can be fitted yourself. The price of each printer head is also significantly lesser than of Epson, Canon and Brother.2. Total 4 buttons - one to cancel. one to pull/re-pull pages. one to colour copy and one to do B&W copy. The copy function is very simple. It will scan and print in one touch. No need to scan separately and print separately.This makes it very simple and easy.3. HP support and availablility. This is its biggest strength. Printer installation and demo done in 1 day. Product is of last year, hence called HP support to update the warranty according to purchase, done in 2 days flat.4. For home printing needs, speed of printing is okay for me. Prints about 7-8 pages per minute. First page print takes longer, i guess the printer takes time to warm up. It becomes quicker after that.5. Paper quality also decides the quality of print. A colour print on a rough A4 sheet and a glossy photo paper is very very different. It is not fair to compare both.6. Super easy to install and operate yourself. One youtube video is enough. Everything has a slot and there is nothing that can go wrong. Even ink is spill free.Cons:As said by other reviewers here, it is not as fast as Epson or Brother.It is light weight and plastics are flimsy. So rough and careless usage may break or crack parts."
4,"I was looking for a printer which would allow me to take printouts at very affordable prices. Initially I was thinking about buying a normal inkjet printer but the main problem with them is the cost of printing per page. And the inkjet cartridges are also very expensive and get finished very soon. Then I thought of buying a laser printer because they were fast and per page printing cost was also very low but the main problem with laser printers are that they are expensive and most of them can't be used for colour printing. Then I came to know about the ink tank printers which seemed a modified version of inkjet printers. I looked up on the internet about it and most of the results showed positive reviews about these ink tank printers. Hence, I decided to buy this printer for me. Aftera a week's usage I'm penning down the pros and cons of this printer below,Pros,1. Very low printing cost per page. (10 paise for black n white and 20 paise for colour printouts).2. 4 ink bottles (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) are already provided with the printer which should last around one year if used moderately.3. Very much ink efficient compared to a normal inkjet printer. One can print upto 4000 pages of black n white printouts and 6000 pages of colour printouts with the bottles already given along with this printer.4. The printing speed is moderate if used for normal colour printing. If used in echo mode, then the printing becomes even faster ! It can print upto 20 black n white pages and 8-10 colour pages in a minute in echo mode. In normal mode the speed will slightly decrease. It takes around 2-3 minutes to print a colour saturated image or poster on a photo paper which is quite fast.5. Very easy and user friendly buttons are provided for controlling the printer for novice users.Now let's talk about it's cons,1. It's not a wireless printer. Hence you can't print from anywhere, the printer has to be connected to a PC/laptop via a USB cable. This makes it little difficult to take printouts using a mobile phone (although OTG can be used).2. No auto duplex printing. It cannot print on both sides of a paper automatically.3. The initial setup and assembly of the printer is quite complex and may be intimidating for a first time user. It's best to call an official HP support person to do the setup and installation.Last but not the least, keep the following points in mind before buying this or any other ink tank printer,1. Buy ink tank printers if and only if you're going to print very frequently. If you don't print regularly then don't buy such printers because the inks will dry up if you leave it unused for a long time. You've to print at least 3-4 times in a week to keep the ink from drying.2. Although the printing cost of such printers are very less, you've to be careful about it's initial pricing. The primary cost of such printers are much higher although it'll benefit you in the long run.3. It uses liquid ink in the ink tanks, hence do not move our disturb the printer frequently because it may cause bubble formation inside the ink tanks and that'll damage the printheads. Printheads are not cheap to replace so keep this thing in mind.That's all folks. I hope this review helps you guys to decide whether to buy this printer or not."
4,Print quality is ok.It took me 3 minutes to print A4 size photo sheet. N it is ok to take that much time.If we get that print in short time we will touch that printed area then colours on that photo will be spreaded allover on that photo.So immediately don't touch photos after getting them printed. let it dry for sometime then it is ok to touch printed area.I got this printer for 8370 in amazon great indian sale.N difference between 410 n 310 is only wifi option. In my opinion btr to by this printer itself. u r getting cable to print from mobile itself. N it is esay to Operate with our mobile. Till now didn't used their tech support. Installed this printer by seeing YouTube videos. If u don't know how to install the same then for sure take their tech support.
5,"genuine HP brand printer works best quality prints ,easy to operate and best software from HP to install in PC . value for money"
1,Did not expect such a low quality from HP. Also warranty started 5 months before I bought. Still trying to sort out warranty issue. Cartridge jam in just 20 days.
5,Hp ink tank 310 model works fine. Low noise while printing.
1,"Pls dont sell hp printers through amazon hp printer is pulling down goodwill of amazon,after sale service of hp is very very worst,no installation till now delivered on- 24/1,installation req on-25/1 today- 30/1,and also said that your warranty is only for 10 month instead of 12 months,worst worsttttt."
5,"I had been using Canon pixma MP287 for more than 5 years. But the loud clattering sound right from day 1 of purchase had been unbearable, but HP310 has been far far better in following respects.1.Most silent printing2. Faster printing & scanning.3. Beautiful printing quality.4.Contast,brightness etc of the colour printcan be adjusted as per your requirement though exact colour may not be achieved."
1,"Bought for 7649/- on 10th May. The print quality is good only on A4 size papers for document printing. When it comes to photo printing on photo paper the colors are not drying quickly. Especially black color is not sticking to the paper at all. I tried with several photo papers. The colors can be washed away even with gently finger rub even after 5 hours in this hot sun(45 c Hyderabad). Hence I don`t suggest this printer for photo printing. Better go for Epson. Otherwise the printer is user friendly and easy to install. I am disappointed with photo printing issues and quality of printing. However, for the price I paid I am not that happy."
4,Good printerBest in its segment and price range.No issue in official useOnly issue in photo printing by its light print and ink is removed by washing.All ink tank are same. No difference. I can see epson also. I give 5 star if its print is some dark col.
1,Installation problem every 48hrs once we should do install.Device supporting problem happening.It's giving only 3000pages only same cost canon Epson printers giving 7000pages.
4,"1.Print quality of HP is better than of Epson.2. Epson gives better plastic body that of HP.3. Epson gives us low maintenance cost printer.4. In Hp we get  ink tank attached to the printer but Epson doesn't.5. The way, Hp takes to cover the printer's inner portion, is great. Epson printer's inner portion get more dusty that of HP printer.6. In my eye, in business purpose hp is good for colour photo print. Epson will go for xerox or other normal print out.7. It is too hard to get a original ink in online."
5,"PRINTING QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, ONLY ONCE FOUND INK FLOW GOT DISTARBED WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT AFTER 3-4 DAYS BREAK, BUT SURPRISINGLY IT CORRECTED IT SELF ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY I GOT FINE PRINT AT SECOND ATTEMPT( MACHINE SELF DETERMINED) ITS PREVIOUS PAGE WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INK FLOW. ONE SHOULD REMEMBER INK COST IS HIGH FOR THIS PRINTER. HOPE THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN."
4,"For those who don't know how to set this up, follow these (its pretty easy)IMPORTANT STEPS (FAILING TO PERFORM THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR PRINTER)1. Remove cardboard protectors inside the printer by opening front hatch.2. After opening front hatch (not the scanner), you will see a orange bolt assembly. Slide that and bring it in the middle.3. When the bolt attached assembly is in the middle, turn the bolt right side (its okay you can use force for a bit). The bolt will pop out off the assembly, we won't need the bolt again to set up the printer (but keep it aside).4. Unpack the print heads, and push the tricolour printhead on the left, and black printhead on the right (black printhead will require some extra push to get inside). After they r secured, close the blue hatch (tip top mechanism).5. DO NOT SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY TO ITS INITIAL POSITION AGAIN, machine will do it itself. Close the black covers and that's it.6. Start filling up your ink tank. You must fill all of the ink tanks not just one. Remember you dont have to completely fill it, mind the minimum level and the ink level should be above that but not necessarily on the maximum level. As for the ink bottles, remove the white cap completely and break the seal, DO NOT DAMAGE THE BOTTLE NUZZLE JAM, it workes like a vulve.STARTING UP YOUR MACHINE1. Connect the machine to power. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE PC YET! Turn on power button, printer will start ink priming now and make some Conjuring 3 noises (its normal).2. Pull out paper loading tray from the back of the printer. Use A4 paper, slide the blue hook to left load the paper (keep the paper stack to right side. Not in the middle, not in the left, but in the right). Secure the paper pulling blue hook to the right again.3. If you see any blinking icon (any) in the control panel, push and hold resume button for 3 seconds and you're almost done.4. Printer will print 2 pages at first automatically. Open the scanner, allign any one of the pages on the glass (printed side faces the glass) in the bottom right corner. Close the scanner and press the colour copy button once. Printer will copy the page (first 2-3 printouts maybe weird no need to panic). Now your printer finished ink priming completely.5. Connect it to your PC now. Download HP smart app from Microsoft store (its completely free). And if you have already f*ked up the windows update just like me then, my friend, you have to re-install your windows.6. Once HP smart app is installed create your account and that's it use its interface to print normally, make sure you're using proper page size.You're welcome!"
1,"Now this is my Third complain1.Techzart Smart watch returned to seller without informing me..Delivery boy told he ll come next day and deliver.2.Nokia 3310,i gifted to my grandmother.One switch was not working..So faulty product..3.HP inktank 310..print head was not working..it was delivered on time but after installation it showed print head error..Again supplying faulty product.Amazon team and Amazon product becoming risky to purchase nowadays."
3,"Product is good. But no Installation service provided till now, If HP is not proving Installation then how can they provide after sale warranty.Overall product is good.Printing through Laptop/ computer is very fast ( Takes max. 10-15seconds for one color print )Printer through Mobile is very slow ( takes around 3minutes for one color print)I have installed it by myself by the help of youtube videos, otherwise its very difficult to install for a new person.Printing quality is average.Built Quality is below average.Design is compact.Ink Consumption is high, My black Ink is 50% in a tank now (with max 200 prints)Other Color inks are 70-75% remaining  ( with same max. 200 prints)"
1,"I bought this printer on 03rd May. When checked with HP website for warranty, it was showing  that already 6 months the printer warrant is finished and only 6 months warranty is left.I contacted Amazon and explained about the issues. They immediately sent an replacement. With the replacement order also the same issue.Warranty already started on 01-Dec-18 and only 6 months warranty left. Also, the serial number mentioned on the Invoice was also wrong. I struggled a lot to get it rectified. Poor and pathetic support was the gift I got it.Be careful with the purchase of this printer"
5,"The printer was recd in time on 25 jan 2019 well packed Installation was carried out on 29 jan 2019 satisfactorily. However, on 31 jan when I started the first print, the movement of paper was sluggish and incomplete and error message indicating black printhead problem was seen. Informed HP who have raised a complaint and also informed it could possible a case of DOA!.Will get in touch on ce the technician attends to it."
5,"Product is very good, easy to install and use. In a minute you can print 10 page full colour and 25 page black and white.I didn't get printer invoice and warranty card with this printer."
5,"Using from oct 2020,1) Print quality is good.2) Plastic material is sturdy though printer is very light weight.3) Printing speed is acceptable.  While purchasing I was confused between ink tank & inkjet printer as latter is low-cost, but saw & heard reviews about inkjet's high operating cost (though ink can be injected in cartridge but it seldom works & can damage printer).My concern before purchasing was what if printer is left unused for long duration & to my surprise it works quiet well as I didn't use it for 1-2 months on 2 occasions (this is not the case with inkjet printers, you'll have to replace cartridge).  Installation & operation is also easy.  Though upfront cost is higher but economical in long term.Overall excellent for students & useful for small office."
1,Hi Team. I bought this product on 30 sep 2019 and I have problems with printer cartridge and while I check the warranty it says already expired during may only. But when I purchased it was having 1 year warranty. This not being supported by HP nor Amazon. I am unable reach Amazon customer care... this is really worst service and wrong committment.  I am a regular customer of Amazon and this kind of cheating was  never expected. Now I have to get this repaired myself. So any of you whole buying HP products on Amazon please check the warranty properly
1,don't purchase anything from HP because i think this is Chinese company now so they don't you provide after sale service after all i purchased this printer in June month printer works for 2-3 months in good condition but after that printer started to give very slow printing after tracing one month to my complaint to HP they closed the complaint with saying printer is working fine even i proved that printing is slow before their engineer and their excutive tasted on their same own printer in their service center and admitted that problem. karlo bagh delhi service center is pathetic. printing speed will become below half which company claim after some heavy usage so dont buy this model and even i suggest dont buy any model from hp service is pathetic
1,I purchased this hp printer due to my experience with hp but this time hp and amazon both disappointed me. HP don't bother about installation of online purchased items. After many efforts I was able to book request for installation. Person assigned installation didn't call me and reported that I didn't pick phone. Some other official blamed me outrightly for this without confirming the facts. Instead of evolving a system to overcome deficiencies hp is supporting it's erring officials. Thinking to return as now I think hp will not support is any issue of warranty arises.
1,"I recommend everyone who purchases this, should first check invoices,p-slip,order summary etc. Otherwise you would be fooled/cheated.I'd purchased this printer on 29thSep2019 upon checking I found that Manufacture Warranty End Date is 14Nov2019(so damn sure it's old product, not even 2 months). I thought, as it's working fine later I could raise dispute with HP I could extend the warranty period providing invoices etc.Now comes the agony when checked, serial number is p-slip is invalid and doesn't match with that of the device(They've noted it as 'New Serial Number' in p-slip). Due to this you can't have warranty service from HP. Now if you go back to amazon support reporting this issue, they keep us waiting endlessly without a resolution and your 1yr purchase period gets over and warranty period is expired.So if you have to service the printer, you cannot have it under warranty. And thus my printer is unusable since 1 month."
3,"Delivery was prompt. Packaging was good.Installation was smooth. I installed it on Mac. Generally use wired rather than wifi. So convenient for me.I noticed that the ink does dry up after some time if not used. It also affects the printout quality.Scanning is very bad. Because the lid is very light, for scanning, it cannot press the paper by itself appropriately. You need to press the lid explicitly to have good scan quality. It is over and above the psi mentioned while scanning."
5,"Used For several days and wrote review.Pros:1.Easy to Install2. As u know its ink tank so no stress for ink usage.3. Fast with scan and copy4. Fast with PC.5. Best in this price range.(Don't overexpect).6. Hassle Free Ink Filling.(Easy, with valves to avoid spilling).7. All in one Print, scan ,copyCons:1. Very slow with Mobile phone OTG using HP print service app(official).Overall best printer at its price range must go for it."
4,"After making all searches for almost two months during this lockdown, finally come to conclusion, to purchase the printer which is available and affordable with cost of printer and cost per page of printing (b&w & color). Was confused to either go for HP or Epson. First wanted to go for only printer and not all in one, but for few thousand rupees, feels better to have AIO option incase future needs arise.Pros:1. Easy to install (after seeing some youtube videos), inserting ink in tank is super easy, no waste of ink, hands clean.2. Print quality was good.Cons:1. I tried to use OTG cable with mobile to take print but cannot print with HP Smart app, as the printer is not at all detectable in HP Smart app. Spoken to hp service, they also said this print is not supportive to OTG-Mobile use. But after searching few more option such Printershare which is paid version but finally tried nokoprint  and it solved the issue with nokoprint. So only regret that HP original software cannot give printing solution via mobile. Request them to work on it.I will make further review after few months."
4,As usual Hp blacktext prints are crisper than epson  and are better. The black ink does not wash off with rain water (tested on rain water ) .as a office printer  does everything . I do miss the wireless function at 7400 i am happy with the purchase . printed a whole page photo print on  5 rs desmat photo paper . print does not scrap away as reviewed by others. Photo print is not as best as epson but i can say its 90 % of epson photo print .  1 issue i had that the warranty showed to be 4 months  left only  which nearly gave me a heart attack . i have my friends at Iqor which are the service providers of Hp laptops & printers and they assured me the warranty  starts with the  gst bill . ( On the safe side i asked for an installation and the warranty date got rectified .)
1,"This printer has given me nothing but headaches! Just after 3 months of use and less than 50 print outs, both cartridge got damaged. Since it was on warranty, they serviced it free of cost. Exactly one year after purchase, the paper feeding mechanism has become faulty. Also, the print of low quality and very slow. I think they have supplied me a defective piece when I got it in Diwali offer (Rs 7999)."
5,"If you are looking for some printer which has high quality prints, and operation cost is low, ink tank printers are the choice you should consider. Also, Ink tanks printer don't dry up even when not used for sometime. The filling of ink is also something which is spill proof. So overall and a very good purchase."
5,I knew well that HP was a good company and it proved again!! Superb print quality. Only disadvantage is that it has no adjust feature to control black and colour print. Xeroxes are  good. Any colour they give. Superb model.... Easy to install. I printed over 100 pages in 3 days and only 2ml of black was used. Ink quality very good. Worth of its price!Stay Home And Stay Safe. Buy HP without any thought! üôèüôèüòÉ
4,"Nice printer, giving one star less as it's only 1 week of using"
3,Worst HP support.... No one will come for installation or for tech assist. Print quality is better. But while printing from web page of from email the font is too low and just get printer in a corner of a a4 and no way you can change the font size. That menu option will not be available while printing from web. But printing from MS word is OK. No tech can fix this even assisted almost 10 Times with remote support. But they won send a tech to home also.... On site warranty is just fake.
4,Going through some reviews it was a bit disappointing at first but after some research I found it satisfied enough to go ahead and order it. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to install it. All you need to do is Dowload 100 + mb printer software and you're done. Took 40-45 minutes to complete the process. Only hope that it's economical in the long run. (fingers crossed)
5,We bought this printer 15 days back. It's a good one. Ita got scanner n printing option. we tried printing on a photo paper the print was good but it leaves a black soot kind of thing after sometime on the surface. Not sure it's the same with other brand.  Other than tat its good.We installed the printer on own.The person who was assigned to instal dint help us in anyway. While unboxing he kept on saying without a CD I won't touch it even after informing tat it's not needed and also not included in the box n he left. Other representative was helpful on the phone n helped us.The printer is good.
3,"A good product - - poor service.Printer is good, build quality is well enough. But please ensure not to load too many sheets in the tray, else they might get jammed.Service wise, Amazon is too bad in terms od service. The seller shipped the product with incorrect serial number, today I'm trying third time to get this one fixed with Amazon support. All they do is just send a so called note to the seller and ask me to wait and check my mail some time later.Support by HP is also not as expected. Don't try their whatsapp support, it literally sucks. My printer got jammed, I read online help, and fixed it all by my own. They reverted via whatsapp after 3 days."
5,has been using from last one month ... very comfortable .we can also print A5 pages ..almost i have taken around 250 A5 pages .. not seen a jam till now .. i brought print share licence from android play store and using usb direct printing..for some reason the default hp plugin didnt print usb  print to printer ...
3,"HP Laser jet P1108 was delivered on date as stated at the time of placing order. It was packed in the original HP cardboard box and looks same as in pictures on website. The contents inside included power cord, USB cable to connect printer to laptop/desktop, Installation CD and toner cartridge. My laptop doesn't have CD drive so I downloaded the driver software from HP website and installed the printer. The printer is working fine, print quality is OK. But today is first day so cannot say much. The printer prints one side of paper only if you need to print on both sides than you need to feed the paper manually. I am disappointed because I purchased it thinking duplex printer but actually it is not. Therefore, this review is for those people specially who are looking for auto duplex printer, please don't be misguided. Otherwise the printer is nice. I will post another review after using the printer for atleast six months."
4,no dual side printing automatically although there's an option to print both sides and there's an option given while giving print command but by changing the side of the papers manually after it prints one side of paper. Otherwise it seems to be good with decent quality prints.
5,"Great product by HP.  Old is gold: old model but highly reliable. Low maintenance. Single function makes it super special: just print and no other useless features. #One most important thing i discovered: HP doesn't allow mobile printing feature for this model, But here is a good news, an android app available in good play store ""NokoPrint"" works very well with this printer. Easy to to connect. Just don't forget to switch on OTG port settings.  So, if you were to ignore this printer for non-mobile printing feature, you have a solution now!!"
5,The print quality is amazing but the installation was a challange as the cd that came along was a legend and the drivers for windows 10 (forget instaling for a Mac) were also not so easy to find had to call my IT guy to fix the issue
4,"I have been using this product for last two months..... One thing is to be remembered that when it activates, it requires 360 watt power...... so don't use it in low voltage.....otherwise printer will stop and red light will go on...... Except it, no problem is yet noticed.......................I recommend it for home & small office use."
5,I am very happy with this HP LaserJet P1108 printer. It works amazing and printing is very smooth with low cost. I highly recommended for small Office and Home use for those who are looking for a Black and White Printer.It does not have a scanner but who used scanners these days while everyone got a smart phone.  It is super easy to install and connect with pc.
3,"The Start Button has issues.Also, the Power Plusgthat connects from power source to printer has some kind of issues. Otherwise Printer is good, Great Speed and Quality. I think i got the product from wrong Seller? :("
5,"Some black dots appeared on printout.Otherwise a great product.Very easy to install, easily add on the Google cloud print."
5,"Hey friends, I had purchased this printer in 2014, for just Rs. 5298. As you can see, the price was really low at that time. I have been using this printer for more than 5 years continuously, without any problem. You can trust HP printers without any doubt. Giving it 5 stars."
5,very easy to use there is no button printer you just have to give command through pc and it will print and print quality is awesome one thing is that it supports A6 size which is used for printing amazon shipping labels if you are seller on ecommerce all good
5,Excellent Quality Low cost Laser Black and White Printer.  Though it seems to be priced higher initially  but the running cost for printing is very low. Ideal for small offices and home use.
1,The printer will defintely print good as it is a laser printer..but worst service given from retailer and hp both....Retailer did not keep any return policy..once you are stuck with this printer you are stuck forever.... has way too hectic installation...hp is the worst brand to order any product from....their service guy could not himself install this printer on my computers ...their CD also doesnt function well...hardly manage to install the printer with the faulty CD...but the irony is my printer csn never be installed if i lose this CD...NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER OR ANY HP PRINTER !! Never
3,Printer is good. It is very base model. Issue is it does not have auto print on both side. We have to collect the first page and feed the paper or back side printing.
5,"Print quality is exceptional! My cd didn't work but the drivers are available in the official website, so I downloaded them from there instead. Instructions were also available so it pretty easy to install."
1,Damaged printer was delivered hence order cancelled and requested product return. The product is expected to be lifted today
5,ProsLaser printingcost effecitvefastwe can print on both sides(manually)ConsStill not observed anyOverall--Decent product hoping good life.i research for many days and gone for it.Happy for this purchase.
4,Costly printer. Not sure why it is very costly.Other than than product is good and features also.
1,"Printing quality is good but it doesn't print at the same speed as normally a laser printer do. And the printing cost is on a very higher side, the original toner's cost is around 4.5K, half the cost of the printer."
5,nice product. using since 1 year
5,PRINTING COST IS VERY ECONOMICAL.BRAND NEW PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED.5-YEARS COMPLETE NOW IS IN RUNNING CONDITIONS.
4,"I received my printer today....being from non technical background , it was a bit tough for me to install the printer but with all odds I was able to do that and now the prints are really good....I must say that it is best laserjet printer at this cost ...Must buy this"
1,"Dear Respected,I am using last two three days, i am strugling too much for log on the printer, there is some problem, need to replace the same, request to amazon and suppler to support and give me fresh and corrct product. Its highly appreceable and avaiid  further litigation or consumer court"
5,I would like 2 thank Amazon for its quick delivery (before as scheduled) product is awesome and installation procedure is user friendly and printing quality is very crisp though i took 500 pages printout and found same quality printing from the very beginning any it's speed is very much satisfactory.
1,Weighting the review after 1 month of use..very upset about the performance of the product..not expecting this kind of performance from a brand like hp. Printer getting very very very slow if continue print just 10page at a time....not recommended to buy..
5,"I have been using this printer for last one month. It performs flawlessly. If you are looking for a laser jet printer, you can buy it without any doubt."
5,"Liked this product,one can go for purchase if  he is in continuous use...."
1,"Dont buy it, printer not working in 15 days, it wont power on & frequently getting auto power off....Costumer support is an auto bot nobody listen to you they just show trouble shoot vedio....Not expected from Famous brand HP...."
5,must go product. still i havent taken too many printouts. only home use. but dinding it good. later if any issue comes i will update you.
5,I ordered one week back. I received it immediately. Easy to install. Nobody can beat HP in printer segment. Only problem is cartridge is costly.
5,Great printer. Hopefully the print cost will be significantly lower than the inkjet printer I bought earlier
5,product is good.. but packing is verry poor.. nice printer for home and office used.. print cost verry low..
5,"Excellent delivery time, good printer for home/office, extremely error free & easy DIY installation guid & process......5 minutes total time from unboxing to 1st print. Highly recommended."
5,packing was not as expected otherwise everything ok
4,"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.Trust the above helps."
3,Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge  empty.
3,"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives."
1,Worst product . Especially software for this product is very poor.Need 8 apps to run a simple printer.That too tiring steps that will take almost one day for successful installation if you are lucky.Cursing my self for buying this.Please buy some other PrinterI am using printers for past 20 years never faced such a tragedy
5,Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece
3,This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.
1,"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever."
1,"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support..."
1,"It so harrasing ,not easy to set up ,it takes more time and total disappointed"
5,"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour"
4,"Printing quality is very impressive, you can choose up to various printing modes like draft, normal & best, you can directly print by hp smart app from your phone, there is a mobile fax option too, Printing speed is also fast but not very fast, main problem I m facing is an alignment problem in an input tray, whenever I want one print out then additional sheets also come in an output tray automatically sometimes though they are not printed but still it's frustrating.  Overall it's a good printer by hp."
1,Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.
5,Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.
4,Very good printer at such cost by hp but the ink is somewhat costly as per printing cost.also if printer is not used for some days then paper jams occur.
1,"I received a very  cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know  that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it."
4,"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA  and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance."
5,"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice."
3,Not see
1,"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product"
5,"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer."
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP VERY SATISFIED AND ULTRAFAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I ORDERED IT YESTERDAY IT SHIPED TODAY AT 12:02 AM AND GOT IT TODAY AT 4:42 PM VERY ULTRA FAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ALL THE FEATURES ARE EASY AND USEFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING MY COMMENT TRUST ME IT IS THE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP NO ISSUES WITH HARDWARE SYSTEM ALSO ACCEPTS IT EASILY YOU CAN BUT IT
5,Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.Pros1. Value for money in this price range2. Easy to install3. Looks great4. Touch displayCons1. Copy quality is not sharp2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.3. ‚ÄúPrint anywhere‚Äù feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.
1,"This is one of the worst printers from hp. Installation, connection, ease of use everything is fine. BUT IT JUST DOES NOT PRINT IN COLOUR. I have been wasting days with tech support trying to resolve the issue, but nothing has happened till date. I asked for a replacement, they behave as if they can't even read that line. They just keep making case ids after case ids.I've been using hp printers for over 2 decades, never had any single issue with any of them.IF YOU WANT A HASSLEFREE PRINTER... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER... REST IS YOUR CHOICE!"
1,"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.who is responsible for it?now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days."
5,"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.Overall a good buy."
5,Product is really good but No extra Black ink included
5,"I bought this product during Great Indian Sale. It's value for Money. everything is fine, just you need to go through Installation Video which can be found on YouTube.Also you can control this printer using mobile app which is nice."
1,"Overall NOT Recommended.-Dosent work with Phones-Useless App doesn't work at all-Scanner is not working, App Dose not Support.Wasted loads of time make it work.-Dead Slow Printing-Does not work with Phones."
2,"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great."
4,Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.
1,Update: Never made a worse electronic parchase than this. Tray became faulty within months and since then it's showpiece. No attempts to repair helped and cartridges would dry up without use. Paper just wouldn't go for printing.HP seems to be selling cheap quality printers only and better to go for other brandsExtra-black cartidge is missing as mentioned by many others in reviews. Really wonder why Amazon is failing to take steps against the false information without a proper escalation
4,"Positives:1) Easy install and use, less weight/handy.2) hp app3) 3in1 is good (scanner, printer, photocopy)Negatives:1) Not value for money for occasional users.I bought it for school online class purpose to take prints but it‚Äôs expensive2) Poor customer care -tech support (launched case number but never get call until I tried them)3) Printer comes with demo cartridges for only 12 to 15prints (colour may be 12, B&W may be up to 16)as per customer care , we need to buy two cartridges separately (Rs1600),4) full cartridges may give less prints as well and no instructions (may be 300 to 450 as per others experience)5) Printer papers auto process sucks sometimes, (not often so far),6) I tried to take small size print from smartphones but size selection is intermittent and only  A4 was option (most of the time)My suggestion: if you don‚Äôt use printer daily, please don‚Äôt buy to save your cartridges cost (cartridges may get clotted if you don‚Äôt use ink often)"
1,Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.
3,"Cons:Not worth the money. Problems with colour printing-sometimes it prints in grayscale. Driver needs to be reinstalled every time this issue occurs. There is no option to select colour and grayscale separately which means a colour document will always print in colour. It uses a lot of ink for colour prints. The power connector is loose.Pros:ADF is a great feature reducing manual work.Overall, if you do not need adf, you can always go for a cheaper model like 2621. HP as a brand is good and my previous model 2545 served for 7 years without many issues but this model certainly has its own problems and it is definitely overpriced."
1,"Have never came across such problematic printer...It feels like it likes to throw variety of errors.....At first it failed to recognize setup cartridge (that came along with printer). I had to replace the printer. The replacement piece that came in worked extremely week for first 4-5 days. Then after printing 1st page of the file, it starts throwing in error of 'Paper Mismatch' every single time...I mean almost printer uses A4 sheet and I know where do I need to change the page size ....I changed page sizes everywhere and then I realized its only accepting A5 size... After 2 days session with HP support and Amazon customer care where they made me go through what not change in settings ..I gave up and thanks to Amazon they agreed to refund the money.Never going to buy HP printer again..."
4,"For wireless printing 4178 is good option with adf feature. Specially Direct-WiFi (no wifi router needed) feature is very good & most convenient.Only con is color printing as its not yeild the no.of prints as they mentioned in specs. Only black&white yeilds good as mentioned. When compared to 4123, this 4178 comes with 682 cartridge(twice the no.of prints to 805 cartridge)"
4,"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.And yes, i like the touch screen as well."
4,"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine"
1,"Really bad quality product from HP and pathetic support.The paper gets jammed every time I try to print. (Se picture attached).I contacted HP support, the support engineers came after a week. They initially said a part is faulty, but later didn't change it. They said its fixed no need to replace the part. In few days the paper jam issue started happening again.Its really painful to contact, first they will make you talk to a bot. After 30 mins of chit chatting with the bot, if your session isn't timed out, you will receive the support phone number."
1,I get the order faster and then i used it for 2 days and 3rd days it's stoped working i don't know what's to do whether take it to hp care or return to get replacement .... I taken it to hp care .. after one week they handoverd it to me and again it's stoped working .....In hp care they suggested me to DON'T BUY AT ONLINE . Because they have sample items ... Ugh worst ever ..
3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ‚Çπ, which is excellent value."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
1,"It was really waste of money, I ordered this 1 year before... The printing speed is very slow, everytime errors are coming, it is automatically taking print size as 5*7, catridge is costlier... Only postive part is wifi connection and we can easily give print from mobile also ...I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLEASE DON'T BUT AND GET SUFFERED LIKE ME"
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
5,"Received product yesterday in brand new factory packed condition, Amazon using biodegradable packing materials which was heartening to know.No problems with the setup, it was a little lengthy though. You have to install the HP Smart app and it guides you effortlessly through the entire set up process.Printed a few pages till now, print quality in Draft mode is also good.Will review post after more usage.Very satisfied with the product as of now."
1,"Print quality is sub standard, unlike my earlier HP printer which I used for 6 years. Double side printing is very painful, and doesn‚Äôt happen automatically. One needs to pull out the paper and reinsert it in the tray. It‚Äôs user unfriendly. Paper input tray is of very low quality and the paper crumpled sometimes when it goes in for printing.On day 1 itself I realised that this printer model was a mistake."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
5,"Replaced my earlier wired HP inkjet as it was taking up too much space next to the computers and printing from different computers was a pain, with the cable having to be switched between machines.Very happy with this new 2778 printer, installation on my iMac was a breeze which was a surprise and it has worked very well since then -  more than 25 pages printed without a glitch, yet to print from phone though.Overall the printer has delivered on our expectations of an easy to install and use wireless printer.Amazon service as usual was excellent and now my default choice for office electronics."
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
4,"Compact design, easy to use, take printout and xerox. One thing I noticed that, the color cartridges provided in the box, using this we can't take printout of more than 30 papers. As it's mentioned, 150 papers we can printout in color. Don't know whether it's cartridge issue what they have provided or printer issue."
1,"Don't buy thisThis printer might cost you less but cartridges are too costly.Buying cartridges are like paying EMI for a costly printer.So better buy ink tank printers, b'coz it doesn't have cartridges and ink is less expensive compared to hp 682 ink cartridges."
1,It's only printing color even if you select black and white. This is seriously I didn't expected before buying and now I am clueless also tried contacting support but they also don't have any fix expect trying reset and asking to use laptop instead of mobile.
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
1,"The printer does not work. Installed all apps, all drivers yet it shows offline and is not printing at all.Do not buy. Waste of money and support is non-existentOne star because it won't let me give zero stars"
5,"BELIEVE ME , IT FEELS A BIT FISHY THAT YOU CAN GET THIS PRINTER FOR MERELY 7000RS. ITS A BEAST! I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS NOT THE BEST RATED BUDGET PRINTER ON AMAZON?! I HAVE ATTACHED A PRINTED PICTURE TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXCELLENT QUALITY FOR THIS PRICE POINT . CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO YOUR SMARTPHONE WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL ROUTER, FEATURES ADF AND DUPLEX PRINTING WHICH ARE EASY TO USE AND SUPERB FEATURES IN SAVING TIME.I REVIEWED ALMOST EVERY PRINTER THAT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE UNDER 10000RS AND FINALLY WENT AGAINST THE LEADERBOARD AND MADE A BOLD DECISION TO BUY THIS PRINTER OVER DOZENS OF OTHERS THAT HAD BETTER RATINGS AND I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY DECISION NOW.THE ONLY CON OF THIS PRINTER: THE 57S CARTRIDGE YIELDS A LOT LESSER PAGES THAN ADVERTISED, APART FROM THAT , THE 47 AND THE 57 (NOT SAME AS 57S) YIELD A PRETTY SATISFACTORY AMOUNT OF PAGES.ONE WORD, DONT GIVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE TO CHOOSE A GOOD PRINTER UNDER BUDGET, GO FOR THIS ONE!"
5,Mobile WiFi printing using Canon app or mopria from Android play store. Automatic Document Feeding. Auto Double side printing which other models don't have. Cartridges are also cheaper. Cartridges coming with pack is Made in Japan. Printer Made in Vietnam.
3,"Bought with ease but couldn't install with ease... First the software installation said couldn't install because the current operating system doesnot support... I had windows 8 pro computer.... I called canon customer care and they arranged a technician which they said would charge for installation... I said no problem ... As long as it is installed I was fine... he turned up within few hours of complaint even though I'm in a far interior town in Tamilnadu... He installed it successfully....Finally my suggestion go for ink tank printer or laser printer for more efficient printing cost.... These type of ink cartridges is of no use, catridges are expensive and prints less pages.... The printer is cheap because people no longer buy ink cartridge printer... I didn't have the knowledge , atleast you don't make this mistake...."

5,Scan can be done through flatbed as well as feeder which is on the top.Duplex printing can be done.Print quality is Good.Hassle free WiFi Printing and Scan operations.
5,"I got it a month ago and use it once in a while. Setting it up was easy. They have a bunch of youtube videos for setting up each aspects of the printer. I like the two sided (duplex) printing and the multi-document scanner both of which are features you see only in high end printer. Some of the parts may feel a brittle, but honestly they are fine as I rough use mine and it still looks intact. The print and scan quality is good enough for a home/ office use but might not be enough for a high def printing or scanning.Overall, this is an economical and excellent buy for a normal home/office use.I am yet to check on the ink efficiency which I will update soon."
1,"AFTER REPLACE NEW INK CARTAGE THIS PRINTER IS NOT WORKING, SHOW INK ERROR - 1688PLEASE GIVE CONTACT NO FOR WARRANTY CLAIM"
5,"Bought @ 5,850/- during recent Prime Days Sale. An excellent product with Print-Scan-Copy-Fax functions. Pretty straight-forward set up (set up USB connection BEFORE setting up with Wi-Fi) with easy-to-understand manual in the box as well as online. Cloud printing takes some time to set up as the product is not compatible with Canon cloud Printing; I am using Google Cloud Printing. The admin password it would ask at the time of setup is the ""Serial Number of the Printer"" which can be found at the back of the printer.Update - July 2020: Printer still working without any issue. Try to change both printer cartridges together at the same time to avoid any printer error messages."
2,Not ink efficienct. One black print costs you around RS. 5
1,"--- Update 11th Aug 2021 ---Printer stopped working after about a year. It stopped accepting paper. I've cleaned the feed roller behind the tray and the transfer roller accessible from behind, yet to no resolve.The canon onsite technician visited home to take a look. Tells me the problem is with the paper pickup assembly and not with the feed roller. Charged Rs. 650 in service fees without spending even 10 mins to check the printer. He said I should bring the printer to their service center but assembly related issues can rarely be fixed. Instead they may try to give me a replacement printer for a discount.The printer has no dust deposits outside or inside and has been used about 20 times so far for help with a 10 yo kids homework assignments and some photo prints. I only used original ink cartridges which were replaced once so far.I am writing this to help you decide whether owning a printer vs getting your prints from a print store nearby is a better option for you. I feel like unless you want to frequently (more than four time a week) need to take printouts without which your work cannot proceed, you should avoid owning a printer.--- Original review ---I am a veteran IT worker, have used numerous MFPs at work over the years. I always admired features such as duplex printing, ADF and scan to email in those huge expensive network printing machines.Now you can enjoy most of those features (and more) in home printers such as this one. The printer was fairly easy to setup, and I started printing over WiFi using my laptop AND my OnePlus phone, in no time at all. I also use the printer to help my nephew with his homework assignments and so far everything has been working great.I even took some prints for photo frames etc on glossy photo papers and those too turned out fabulous!The printer is well worth the money and the ink cartridges can last adequately if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.Quick tip 1 - The better the quality of printer media the better the print turns out. So make sure you use good quality paper when you expect the best quality print; whether for photos or regular document prints.Quick tip 2 - Make sure you know how to use photo editing software to get the exact size of print outs you really want. If you use A4 sized paper and mistakenly print a 4x6 with borderless printing, you will end up wasting a lot of ink, for a picture you may not use after all."
4,"A great capable printer, let down by the software. So i bought this printer to replace a 4 year old basic printer/scanner from HP.Pros,Improved printing speeds compared to my hp deskjet 3545Has duplex printingHas auto document feeder, (can only scan one side)Can be used as a standalone printer very easily, with the controlsCompact and very well designedFast startup and shut offConsBuildqualityMobile app poorly designedDesktop apps poorly designedScanner not good as my hp deskjet 3545"
3,Updated review after 3 months of usage :‚Ä¢Too high printing cost.‚Ä¢The installation is good but wifi print is easy to set up. Your device and printer need to be connected to same wifi thats all.‚Ä¢The package was not well packed with bubble covers. However they kept brown paper of 1-2 meters in the amazon box along with the printer box.The piece is pucca and new. So the seller can be trusted.‚Ä¢Fax option is good for the price.‚Ä¢The print quality is good but takes lot of time to process and print it.‚Ä¢My previous canon printer process late and papers get jammed often. Same problem is seen here.‚Ä¢Cadrige and all stuffs are verywell packed. The cadridge can be refilled with syringe either by yourself or any local refill shop. But it runs out very quickly. Thats too bad for emergency uses. You should buy couple of cadridge as you never know when it'll run out. For me it hasn't even took 50 papers (of written documents) for full refilling.‚Ä¢my opinion : i regret buying this. Reading all good reviews i brought this crap. I honestly suggest you to not buy this.‚Ä¢No canon inkjet printers are useful for home purposes.
4,"‚úîCanon pixma 4270, the printer that I bought for home use particularly for my baby.  Hence, on that point of note it's more than sufficient.‚úîI'm using windows 7 ultimate 64bit software (ofcourse outdated)  for which I couldn't find the given CD useful. For me installation was really difficult perhaps, I should update my OS to win 10.‚úîConnection via mobile was super quick‚úîAll you gotta do is download and install canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY from play store (android  user) that's all, printing is that easy.‚úî Along with the printer they provide us with 2 ink cartridges, CD and a user manual. I just followed those instructions from the manual and few YouTube videos‚úî Be it Xerox, scan, copy, duplex print or photo print it does the job for the given cost. Bought it on Great Indian Festival  Sale for 5200/-Update:‚úî The cons that I found was the ink cartridges doesn't last longer as they quote. I printed less than 50 copies even before that it shows 25% of ink. Pathetic!‚úî Dear buyers, invest 2k more and opt for an ink tank printer‚úî While printing use papers that is 80GSM or more"
1,Everything ok except Cartridge....It won't print atleast 100  pages per cartridge...Informed to Customer care...They too agreed that it won't print 50 color pages also...The main AIM of the Printer is to Print..But it won't satisfy...Wasted 7k on this Dust bin..Using as a scanner...Not at all worth for printing...
3,"Writing the review on receiving the product. The printer was super easy to install. Took less than 5 minutes to download the app and set it up. Supports AirPrint so I can now easily print from my iPhone. Print quality is good and speed is okay ( faster than my previous hp printer but obviously not as fast as a laser printer). Offers auto duplex & auto document feeder making printing work so much easier and hassle free. Cannot comment right now on the economy of the cartridges, will have to update after a few months. However, one con of the printer is that canon has not supplied the manual. Only a few pages mentioning how to set up the printer have been supplied. What is the use of having a great feature full product if I don‚Äôt know how to use most of the functions! One has to download the detailed manual from their website.Edit (after 2 years usage): The printer ink is very costly and runs out after a few prints. Refuses to print black and white pages if the colour cartridge is running low (even with a completely new and full B&W cartridge). To top it off, ink cartridges are not easily available."
2,"Printer is good but after buying this printer real struggle starts, as the discription show that it can print up to 400 pages with single ink cartridge but the truth is, it can only print around 80-100 pages (black). Go for ink tank printer would be less costly in long run. But the advantage is that with this is it can print on both side of paper its duplex."
5,"First of all , thanks Amazon for super quick delivery.It supports all the functionalities that is required for home use. The best features are, WiFi and Auto feed.The driver is available in online. I downloaded from net and installed on my Windows 10; very easy to install. Android app is also easily available and easy to connect with the printer. Got the print out and scanning done from both pc and mobile phone.Few reported issue with page detection, I also faced the issue first time. But, got rid of it once went through the instruction.Print quality is Ok, as I set the quality as *Standard*.Need to find out solution for the expensive cartridge :)I guess Canon provided driver for Ubuntu. But, did not find any driver for Rpi platform for Ubuntu."
5,"My usage is about 100-200 pages a month (home use only). About 60% of that is b/w photocopy of pages from my daughter's text books (need a copy coz for junior classes, the books stay at school).Haven't tried photo quality printing, but regular printing is fast and good quality.Setup was quick too.The only downside is that the phone app is not so intuitive."
5,"I bought this for some light printing at home - the Wifi function is quite useful and does away with the need to connect the printer to a computer, although it does take a few more steps involving installing an app on your smartphone etc. Wish the LCD was backlit since it would have aided visibility during installation - minor quibble only because the printer was placed in a corner without much light. Haven't had to use the LCD after the setup. Printing in draft mode is quick and uses less ink. The ink consumption is slightly on the higher side - not such a big deal since replacement cartridges are on the cheaper side. For higher volume printing, I would suggest going for a Brother monochrome laser printer which will be much quicker and with higher yield per toner cartridge."
4,"Printing is fairly simple and good.Decent speed of scan and the mobile phone interface for both scanning and printing is a big plus.The user interface of the scanner is terrible. Having grown used to the cano-scan toolbox which was straightforward, this is a most convoluted interface.Setup is totally confusing and with error messages and whatnot. If you are technology challenged, this is not the device for you."
1,"After 2-3 months giving feedback, Build quality is very bad. Printing only 100 pages in black color and 25-30 color documents, catridges dead, external ink refilled black color, lasts only 50 pages per refilled. Color catridge is not working after refilled. Really don't buy this ashamed product. Claiming 300-400 prints, what's a big joke with customers. Go for laser or inktank printers Epson or HP only.."
2,"The device is good for printing color and B/W documents, but the device does not have a LAN port. Therefore, the only way to connect it is either using USB (non network mode), or using Wi-Fi. I am using the latter, and I have constant trouble in finding it on my LAN computers. Its almost useless for me now as a network printer. My suggestion would be to go for a wired LAN printer for anyone who needs a network printer. The scanner works and quality is ok, but works only when triggered from computer (I had to install NAPS32 software for this); one click scan from MFP didnt work. Haven't tried other functions, so cant say about those. For the build quality, its plastic and is poorly built (the trays have a lot of wobble), and paper alignment will therefore, always be a challenge. All in all, if you want something not too expensive, plan on using it without network connection at one location only, then this may work. If you want something that works on a network, and can take care of a home/ small office print/ scan/ copy needs, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"This product worked only for one year and now it is not usable. I might have raised 10 complaints in customer service but every time my complaint was cancelled with remarks that customer not approved repair charge. No one ever contacted me and every time complaint was cancelled with same remarks. I have ordered HP printer now. If canon customer service reads this, please see service complaint log for serial number KLUN19752. I will never recommend canon products to anyone"
1,"printing is poor and already looks faded. black and color prints are really BAAD! Brand new ink cartridge. HP print quality is WAY ahead! I now need to see the longevity of the ink. Ink got over already and hardly I printed 1/4th the number of copies as my HP deskjet. While the printer is quite modern with many automated facilities that HP doesn't have, it loses all its advantages to two things:1) print quality2) ink longevity, which translates to very costly print.Overall impression: DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER"
1,"The most difficult printer to operate!! Never connects to the laptop / iPad / iPhone in the 1st, 2nd or 10th try! Takes ages. Need to uninstall the app, reinstall it and then pray to god that it connects. The worst printer ever!!"
5,"Overall a good productPros,1 Easy to setup,2 wifi printing works cool3 Quality of single side print is good4 supports border less printing5 color printing quality is acceptable in A4 sheet also6 scan, print over wifi in canon app works coolCons,1 quality of duplex printing is little less compared to single side print quality, (text were visible little brownish)That's all for nowRecommended for home and small businesses use"
4,"This Multi Function Printer can Print Color and B&W, Scan, Copy, Fax with Both Side printing and ADF feature besides easy to install. It comes with a set of Color and B&W cartridges with the Printer so need to buy extra initially however number of prints from these cartridges is far less than promised. Works well with USB and WiFi for both computers and Smartphones but quality of Prints from Mobile application is not good. Initial problems with Head aligning can be resolved by reinstalling cartridges once."
5,"For starters, installation was a cinch - started with the mobile. Worked flawlessly over wifi on mac, iOS a d android devices.It takes a few tries to get the ADF scan to work well, set the paper guides correctly and it does a good job after that. If the correct size isn‚Äôt set via the guides, the sides could get chewed up and the scans would become angled.Dual side print worked well. Again, it‚Äôs important to get the setting of the paper width / guides at the right position. Once this is done, papers go in smoothly and get spit out well. Interesting, the prints come out in the reverse order, unlike other printers. If you‚Äôre someone who wants to read as it comes out, you may have to wait until the end.Canon has done a fairly good job coming up with a home printer with these features at this price point. No wonder it‚Äôs not easy to get your hands on this printer easily.While Ink Tank printers are good for larger volumes, for someone who has a need to print a few pages randomly, this may be a good choice."
5,"I like this printer. Specially duplex printing and document feeder is excellent.After using duplex page scanning,it's exceed my expectations.My printing volume is not large but may be cartridge cost is concern.I hv gone thru some videos on youtube which shows how to refill at home."
5,"You will get 400 pages for blackand 180 pages for coloras mentioned on box.i would suggest its better to go for this product if you are certain thatyour monthly usage is not more than 30 pages . cause the print cost and ink cost is not very economical.also i have checked scanning and other functions they are working well.mobile printing, desktop printing, wireless printing. everything is working perfectly.This is my 1st printer and everything is fine so i have no regrets atleast for now."
3,Pros.ScannerPrinterMobile appWirelessLegal paperAuto scanning from dual trayConsIt's inkjet so watch your printing.Bad in terms of paper pulling take only If your average printing is lessCostly now due to covid had bought in discount then.Pairing was not so easy as mentioned
1,I have write this review after 12 days using the printer. My suggestion is don't purchase this model printer. It was consuming more ink.Like one cartige cost around Rs-600/- only 60 to 70 pages black & White print can done. If your looking for any business purposes it wasn't not suitable. So for business go for other models.  PRINT QUALITY IS SUPER but not ink iffecient as per the specifications mentioned.
1,"Print cost is too high, ink expensive & finish off too early.. black & white cost more than 6 rs per page.. takes lot of time in printing & start up.. better invest more - go for ink jet or ink tank printer..Photo print quality is too bad, very light in printing colors.. not recommended after usage of one year but there is no option as already bought & can't change"
1,"The 2-3 times it has allowed me to print without tearing my hair out in frustration has been bliss. The rest of the time,  the paper jams so frequently, that its easier for me to go to a print store to print.  At this point, my brand new 'all in one' printer is laying in the corner, acting as a dust receptacle. And all of the customer service numbers in India are currently not in service. Absolutely pathetic."
5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ‚Çπ3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,"At this price you cannot get anything better. For those who are complaining about the cartridge life, please NOTE THAT THE INCLUDED CARTRIDGE IS A STARTUP CARTRIDGE WITH ONLY 20% INK. Please buy a standard cartridge and you will achieve your dream number of pages... Also its a home printer so do not expect a print speed of 1000 pages per minute. Overall very good investment. I do recommend.It was also received with all HP original Seals. So many thanks to the seller for sending an brand new piece."
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,"I had a problem with this defective product. The customer care was difficult in returns and replacement. High value products should be returned with no hassles. That is how Amazon US and UK or any other country functions. Amazon customer care was very hesitant. The product description had 20 pages per min for BW and 5 pages per min color prints, but it would take 5 mins to print a black and white page with a simple letter. I was not even able to print an amazon bill. The color print never worked. Amazon agreed to a replacement. The replacement arrived and I tried to print a simple BW document and it didn't print at all. The replacement never worked at all. Amazon took the replacement back with a lot of very difficulty after sending video evidences and multiple photos of their useless product. Never buy this model. I have a HP Inkadvantage 310 series and it works like butter, fast and easy to use. Never by printers with cost less than Rs5000 from HP. They sell outdate hardware."
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it‚Äôs not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don‚Äôt cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from üò∑ u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
3,Appario Retail Private Ltd did not respond to email. Wrong product serial number were mentioned in invoice because of that I could not get HP redemption. It is very bad that Appario Retail Private Ltd  did not respond to emails and willingly mentioned wrong product serial  number so that I could not get redemption from hp. Neither HP nor amazon have no corrective measures.
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
2,HiI am here to tell u about the printer i brought first i tell u cons there are many consCONS : 1)THERE IS NO OPTION FOR COPIES LIKE IF I KEEP 1 PAPER IN SCANNER AND I WANT 10 COPIES AT A TIME BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO PRINT 10 COPIES AT A TIME2) THE PAPER IS STRUCKING IN BETWEEN RODS WHILE PRINTING.3) LAST BUT NOT LEAST  THE INK CARTRIDGE IS SO EXPENSIVE 700 PER 1 BLACK INK CARTRIDGE AND 700 PER TRI COLOR CARTRIDGE AND WHEN WE PRINT UPTO 20 PAGES WITH BLACK OR TRI COLOUR INK WILL BE COMPLETED WITH WHAT INK U PRINTED . THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INK SHOULD BE VERY CHEAP BUT HERE INK IS VERY EXPENSIVE.4) NO WIFI AVAILABLE5)WE CANNOT CONNECT MOBILE SO MUCH TIME WITH OTH CABLEPROS :  PRINTER IS BUDGET FRIENDLY FOR HOME BUT INK IS VERY HIGH...PLEASE DONT BUY THIS......HOPE YOU READ THIS REVIEW.THANK YOU.
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
1,The printer doesn't include Cartridge. then i saw the bwlo saying customer also ordered comp pack. then i have ordered cartridge as well. finally there was no BW cartridge only color came and ordered again BW and waiting for delivery. its frustrating ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not good approach. be clear in your add and provide the right suggestion to customer.also . the printer box was delivered at the opened condition. its was not factory packaged. printer was not even covered properly insde‚Ä¶.im not at happy with this deal.
1,"It does not work. It prints pages in parts and then stops - or does not print at all. Have to press the black or colour button repeatedly to make it start. And whatever printing it does is done at a pace slower than a snail on a relaxed outing!! And printing is accompanied by disturbing noise line by line. the whole unit is tinny, like a child's toy - only gives no pleasure.I have never complained of an Amazon product. Could you please advise where do I go from here. How does one lodge a complaint? How to return the printer? (I am ordering another one from you.)Thanks and regards."
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
1,"After a lot of trial and error by me as well as by the technician from HP, finally the conclusion was drawn that this printer is not compatible with MacOS. Weirdly, this is not mentioned anywhere in Amazon detail page and HP has kept this fact hidden in some safe vaults which I failed to discover."
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
1,I received the HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2338 model today. I have tried many times to connect my printer with the laptop through usb and using HP smart app. It is not detecting my printer. I even tried to do the same with other laptop still not working. I think I need to replace this product.
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
1,"Not sure if they know what are they building.The printer model says 2338, it is not detected by the driver software on windows 10, m1 mac.Tried returning, disappointed."
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,"Very expensive print, not working with ink refill, every time I have to change cartridge that cost 1600, and it have to be changed after 200 print"
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
1,"Product received one day early, but colour printing error showing and the carriage not compitable error coming. Another important thing, I ordered the item on 22.01.2019 and received on 26.01.2019, but warrenty showing only 4 months balance in HP official site, that means it may be an old return product. I trying to replacement but no option in Amazon. Then I contacted customer care over phone and send photos for proof of warranty. I tried to HP site for warranty dispute , but the site is not working. Totally disappointed in this purchase.So please replace the item at the earliest with a new one and stop making this type of issues to customers.ThanksAfter two I got new one piece, working satisfactory. Thanks Amazon."
1,This product is very good. But this type of ink are very poor. I m not satisfied. Photo print is very very poor and there is blow off.......
4,No WiFi as mentioned.customer services are very good.
4,"This review i am writing after 3 days of usage...I suggest printer demo is required if u r first time purchasing printers or u can call HP customer care for any help regarding printer.1)  Printer quality is Good....  I used Photo sheets 210GSM for photos... When we r printing photos we need to change which type of sheets we r using. Then colour photos clarity will be good.2) Text messages or mail printouts  A4  size black and white print is also good.3) Many people review say that warranty is for 3 or 6 months....  Its false information....  As we purchase  printers, we get GST bills....  Based on purchase date u r warranty will start.4) Some people have giving Printer head was not working....  Its manufacture defects...  We have warranty we can call customer care and solve the issue. We can't blame Amazon for everything.5) Scan print is not so good....  I rate 4 star for scan printouts.  Other printouts r very nice...I am satisfied with this printer.....  If u need Wi-Fi then go for HP 410....."
4,"This printer has a lot of mixed reviews. Everybody praised Epson and Brother. But there are many advantages to this printer which i will mention below:1. Printer Heads are detachable and can be fitted yourself. The price of each printer head is also significantly lesser than of Epson, Canon and Brother.2. Total 4 buttons - one to cancel. one to pull/re-pull pages. one to colour copy and one to do B&W copy. The copy function is very simple. It will scan and print in one touch. No need to scan separately and print separately.This makes it very simple and easy.3. HP support and availablility. This is its biggest strength. Printer installation and demo done in 1 day. Product is of last year, hence called HP support to update the warranty according to purchase, done in 2 days flat.4. For home printing needs, speed of printing is okay for me. Prints about 7-8 pages per minute. First page print takes longer, i guess the printer takes time to warm up. It becomes quicker after that.5. Paper quality also decides the quality of print. A colour print on a rough A4 sheet and a glossy photo paper is very very different. It is not fair to compare both.6. Super easy to install and operate yourself. One youtube video is enough. Everything has a slot and there is nothing that can go wrong. Even ink is spill free.Cons:As said by other reviewers here, it is not as fast as Epson or Brother.It is light weight and plastics are flimsy. So rough and careless usage may break or crack parts."
4,"I was looking for a printer which would allow me to take printouts at very affordable prices. Initially I was thinking about buying a normal inkjet printer but the main problem with them is the cost of printing per page. And the inkjet cartridges are also very expensive and get finished very soon. Then I thought of buying a laser printer because they were fast and per page printing cost was also very low but the main problem with laser printers are that they are expensive and most of them can't be used for colour printing. Then I came to know about the ink tank printers which seemed a modified version of inkjet printers. I looked up on the internet about it and most of the results showed positive reviews about these ink tank printers. Hence, I decided to buy this printer for me. Aftera a week's usage I'm penning down the pros and cons of this printer below,Pros,1. Very low printing cost per page. (10 paise for black n white and 20 paise for colour printouts).2. 4 ink bottles (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) are already provided with the printer which should last around one year if used moderately.3. Very much ink efficient compared to a normal inkjet printer. One can print upto 4000 pages of black n white printouts and 6000 pages of colour printouts with the bottles already given along with this printer.4. The printing speed is moderate if used for normal colour printing. If used in echo mode, then the printing becomes even faster ! It can print upto 20 black n white pages and 8-10 colour pages in a minute in echo mode. In normal mode the speed will slightly decrease. It takes around 2-3 minutes to print a colour saturated image or poster on a photo paper which is quite fast.5. Very easy and user friendly buttons are provided for controlling the printer for novice users.Now let's talk about it's cons,1. It's not a wireless printer. Hence you can't print from anywhere, the printer has to be connected to a PC/laptop via a USB cable. This makes it little difficult to take printouts using a mobile phone (although OTG can be used).2. No auto duplex printing. It cannot print on both sides of a paper automatically.3. The initial setup and assembly of the printer is quite complex and may be intimidating for a first time user. It's best to call an official HP support person to do the setup and installation.Last but not the least, keep the following points in mind before buying this or any other ink tank printer,1. Buy ink tank printers if and only if you're going to print very frequently. If you don't print regularly then don't buy such printers because the inks will dry up if you leave it unused for a long time. You've to print at least 3-4 times in a week to keep the ink from drying.2. Although the printing cost of such printers are very less, you've to be careful about it's initial pricing. The primary cost of such printers are much higher although it'll benefit you in the long run.3. It uses liquid ink in the ink tanks, hence do not move our disturb the printer frequently because it may cause bubble formation inside the ink tanks and that'll damage the printheads. Printheads are not cheap to replace so keep this thing in mind.That's all folks. I hope this review helps you guys to decide whether to buy this printer or not."
4,Print quality is ok.It took me 3 minutes to print A4 size photo sheet. N it is ok to take that much time.If we get that print in short time we will touch that printed area then colours on that photo will be spreaded allover on that photo.So immediately don't touch photos after getting them printed. let it dry for sometime then it is ok to touch printed area.I got this printer for 8370 in amazon great indian sale.N difference between 410 n 310 is only wifi option. In my opinion btr to by this printer itself. u r getting cable to print from mobile itself. N it is esay to Operate with our mobile. Till now didn't used their tech support. Installed this printer by seeing YouTube videos. If u don't know how to install the same then for sure take their tech support.
5,"genuine HP brand printer works best quality prints ,easy to operate and best software from HP to install in PC . value for money"
1,Did not expect such a low quality from HP. Also warranty started 5 months before I bought. Still trying to sort out warranty issue. Cartridge jam in just 20 days.
5,Hp ink tank 310 model works fine. Low noise while printing.
1,"Pls dont sell hp printers through amazon hp printer is pulling down goodwill of amazon,after sale service of hp is very very worst,no installation till now delivered on- 24/1,installation req on-25/1 today- 30/1,and also said that your warranty is only for 10 month instead of 12 months,worst worsttttt."
5,"I had been using Canon pixma MP287 for more than 5 years. But the loud clattering sound right from day 1 of purchase had been unbearable, but HP310 has been far far better in following respects.1.Most silent printing2. Faster printing & scanning.3. Beautiful printing quality.4.Contast,brightness etc of the colour printcan be adjusted as per your requirement though exact colour may not be achieved."
1,"Bought for 7649/- on 10th May. The print quality is good only on A4 size papers for document printing. When it comes to photo printing on photo paper the colors are not drying quickly. Especially black color is not sticking to the paper at all. I tried with several photo papers. The colors can be washed away even with gently finger rub even after 5 hours in this hot sun(45 c Hyderabad). Hence I don`t suggest this printer for photo printing. Better go for Epson. Otherwise the printer is user friendly and easy to install. I am disappointed with photo printing issues and quality of printing. However, for the price I paid I am not that happy."
4,Good printerBest in its segment and price range.No issue in official useOnly issue in photo printing by its light print and ink is removed by washing.All ink tank are same. No difference. I can see epson also. I give 5 star if its print is some dark col.
1,Installation problem every 48hrs once we should do install.Device supporting problem happening.It's giving only 3000pages only same cost canon Epson printers giving 7000pages.
4,"1.Print quality of HP is better than of Epson.2. Epson gives better plastic body that of HP.3. Epson gives us low maintenance cost printer.4. In Hp we get  ink tank attached to the printer but Epson doesn't.5. The way, Hp takes to cover the printer's inner portion, is great. Epson printer's inner portion get more dusty that of HP printer.6. In my eye, in business purpose hp is good for colour photo print. Epson will go for xerox or other normal print out.7. It is too hard to get a original ink in online."
5,"PRINTING QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, ONLY ONCE FOUND INK FLOW GOT DISTARBED WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT AFTER 3-4 DAYS BREAK, BUT SURPRISINGLY IT CORRECTED IT SELF ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY I GOT FINE PRINT AT SECOND ATTEMPT( MACHINE SELF DETERMINED) ITS PREVIOUS PAGE WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INK FLOW. ONE SHOULD REMEMBER INK COST IS HIGH FOR THIS PRINTER. HOPE THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN."
4,"For those who don't know how to set this up, follow these (its pretty easy)IMPORTANT STEPS (FAILING TO PERFORM THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR PRINTER)1. Remove cardboard protectors inside the printer by opening front hatch.2. After opening front hatch (not the scanner), you will see a orange bolt assembly. Slide that and bring it in the middle.3. When the bolt attached assembly is in the middle, turn the bolt right side (its okay you can use force for a bit). The bolt will pop out off the assembly, we won't need the bolt again to set up the printer (but keep it aside).4. Unpack the print heads, and push the tricolour printhead on the left, and black printhead on the right (black printhead will require some extra push to get inside). After they r secured, close the blue hatch (tip top mechanism).5. DO NOT SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY TO ITS INITIAL POSITION AGAIN, machine will do it itself. Close the black covers and that's it.6. Start filling up your ink tank. You must fill all of the ink tanks not just one. Remember you dont have to completely fill it, mind the minimum level and the ink level should be above that but not necessarily on the maximum level. As for the ink bottles, remove the white cap completely and break the seal, DO NOT DAMAGE THE BOTTLE NUZZLE JAM, it workes like a vulve.STARTING UP YOUR MACHINE1. Connect the machine to power. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE PC YET! Turn on power button, printer will start ink priming now and make some Conjuring 3 noises (its normal).2. Pull out paper loading tray from the back of the printer. Use A4 paper, slide the blue hook to left load the paper (keep the paper stack to right side. Not in the middle, not in the left, but in the right). Secure the paper pulling blue hook to the right again.3. If you see any blinking icon (any) in the control panel, push and hold resume button for 3 seconds and you're almost done.4. Printer will print 2 pages at first automatically. Open the scanner, allign any one of the pages on the glass (printed side faces the glass) in the bottom right corner. Close the scanner and press the colour copy button once. Printer will copy the page (first 2-3 printouts maybe weird no need to panic). Now your printer finished ink priming completely.5. Connect it to your PC now. Download HP smart app from Microsoft store (its completely free). And if you have already f*ked up the windows update just like me then, my friend, you have to re-install your windows.6. Once HP smart app is installed create your account and that's it use its interface to print normally, make sure you're using proper page size.You're welcome!"
1,"Now this is my Third complain1.Techzart Smart watch returned to seller without informing me..Delivery boy told he ll come next day and deliver.2.Nokia 3310,i gifted to my grandmother.One switch was not working..So faulty product..3.HP inktank 310..print head was not working..it was delivered on time but after installation it showed print head error..Again supplying faulty product.Amazon team and Amazon product becoming risky to purchase nowadays."
3,"Product is good. But no Installation service provided till now, If HP is not proving Installation then how can they provide after sale warranty.Overall product is good.Printing through Laptop/ computer is very fast ( Takes max. 10-15seconds for one color print )Printer through Mobile is very slow ( takes around 3minutes for one color print)I have installed it by myself by the help of youtube videos, otherwise its very difficult to install for a new person.Printing quality is average.Built Quality is below average.Design is compact.Ink Consumption is high, My black Ink is 50% in a tank now (with max 200 prints)Other Color inks are 70-75% remaining  ( with same max. 200 prints)"
1,"I bought this printer on 03rd May. When checked with HP website for warranty, it was showing  that already 6 months the printer warrant is finished and only 6 months warranty is left.I contacted Amazon and explained about the issues. They immediately sent an replacement. With the replacement order also the same issue.Warranty already started on 01-Dec-18 and only 6 months warranty left. Also, the serial number mentioned on the Invoice was also wrong. I struggled a lot to get it rectified. Poor and pathetic support was the gift I got it.Be careful with the purchase of this printer"
5,"The printer was recd in time on 25 jan 2019 well packed Installation was carried out on 29 jan 2019 satisfactorily. However, on 31 jan when I started the first print, the movement of paper was sluggish and incomplete and error message indicating black printhead problem was seen. Informed HP who have raised a complaint and also informed it could possible a case of DOA!.Will get in touch on ce the technician attends to it."
5,"Product is very good, easy to install and use. In a minute you can print 10 page full colour and 25 page black and white.I didn't get printer invoice and warranty card with this printer."
5,"Using from oct 2020,1) Print quality is good.2) Plastic material is sturdy though printer is very light weight.3) Printing speed is acceptable.  While purchasing I was confused between ink tank & inkjet printer as latter is low-cost, but saw & heard reviews about inkjet's high operating cost (though ink can be injected in cartridge but it seldom works & can damage printer).My concern before purchasing was what if printer is left unused for long duration & to my surprise it works quiet well as I didn't use it for 1-2 months on 2 occasions (this is not the case with inkjet printers, you'll have to replace cartridge).  Installation & operation is also easy.  Though upfront cost is higher but economical in long term.Overall excellent for students & useful for small office."
1,Hi Team. I bought this product on 30 sep 2019 and I have problems with printer cartridge and while I check the warranty it says already expired during may only. But when I purchased it was having 1 year warranty. This not being supported by HP nor Amazon. I am unable reach Amazon customer care... this is really worst service and wrong committment.  I am a regular customer of Amazon and this kind of cheating was  never expected. Now I have to get this repaired myself. So any of you whole buying HP products on Amazon please check the warranty properly
1,don't purchase anything from HP because i think this is Chinese company now so they don't you provide after sale service after all i purchased this printer in June month printer works for 2-3 months in good condition but after that printer started to give very slow printing after tracing one month to my complaint to HP they closed the complaint with saying printer is working fine even i proved that printing is slow before their engineer and their excutive tasted on their same own printer in their service center and admitted that problem. karlo bagh delhi service center is pathetic. printing speed will become below half which company claim after some heavy usage so dont buy this model and even i suggest dont buy any model from hp service is pathetic
1,I purchased this hp printer due to my experience with hp but this time hp and amazon both disappointed me. HP don't bother about installation of online purchased items. After many efforts I was able to book request for installation. Person assigned installation didn't call me and reported that I didn't pick phone. Some other official blamed me outrightly for this without confirming the facts. Instead of evolving a system to overcome deficiencies hp is supporting it's erring officials. Thinking to return as now I think hp will not support is any issue of warranty arises.
1,"I recommend everyone who purchases this, should first check invoices,p-slip,order summary etc. Otherwise you would be fooled/cheated.I'd purchased this printer on 29thSep2019 upon checking I found that Manufacture Warranty End Date is 14Nov2019(so damn sure it's old product, not even 2 months). I thought, as it's working fine later I could raise dispute with HP I could extend the warranty period providing invoices etc.Now comes the agony when checked, serial number is p-slip is invalid and doesn't match with that of the device(They've noted it as 'New Serial Number' in p-slip). Due to this you can't have warranty service from HP. Now if you go back to amazon support reporting this issue, they keep us waiting endlessly without a resolution and your 1yr purchase period gets over and warranty period is expired.So if you have to service the printer, you cannot have it under warranty. And thus my printer is unusable since 1 month."
3,"Delivery was prompt. Packaging was good.Installation was smooth. I installed it on Mac. Generally use wired rather than wifi. So convenient for me.I noticed that the ink does dry up after some time if not used. It also affects the printout quality.Scanning is very bad. Because the lid is very light, for scanning, it cannot press the paper by itself appropriately. You need to press the lid explicitly to have good scan quality. It is over and above the psi mentioned while scanning."
5,"Used For several days and wrote review.Pros:1.Easy to Install2. As u know its ink tank so no stress for ink usage.3. Fast with scan and copy4. Fast with PC.5. Best in this price range.(Don't overexpect).6. Hassle Free Ink Filling.(Easy, with valves to avoid spilling).7. All in one Print, scan ,copyCons:1. Very slow with Mobile phone OTG using HP print service app(official).Overall best printer at its price range must go for it."
4,"After making all searches for almost two months during this lockdown, finally come to conclusion, to purchase the printer which is available and affordable with cost of printer and cost per page of printing (b&w & color). Was confused to either go for HP or Epson. First wanted to go for only printer and not all in one, but for few thousand rupees, feels better to have AIO option incase future needs arise.Pros:1. Easy to install (after seeing some youtube videos), inserting ink in tank is super easy, no waste of ink, hands clean.2. Print quality was good.Cons:1. I tried to use OTG cable with mobile to take print but cannot print with HP Smart app, as the printer is not at all detectable in HP Smart app. Spoken to hp service, they also said this print is not supportive to OTG-Mobile use. But after searching few more option such Printershare which is paid version but finally tried nokoprint  and it solved the issue with nokoprint. So only regret that HP original software cannot give printing solution via mobile. Request them to work on it.I will make further review after few months."
4,As usual Hp blacktext prints are crisper than epson  and are better. The black ink does not wash off with rain water (tested on rain water ) .as a office printer  does everything . I do miss the wireless function at 7400 i am happy with the purchase . printed a whole page photo print on  5 rs desmat photo paper . print does not scrap away as reviewed by others. Photo print is not as best as epson but i can say its 90 % of epson photo print .  1 issue i had that the warranty showed to be 4 months  left only  which nearly gave me a heart attack . i have my friends at Iqor which are the service providers of Hp laptops & printers and they assured me the warranty  starts with the  gst bill . ( On the safe side i asked for an installation and the warranty date got rectified .)
1,"This printer has given me nothing but headaches! Just after 3 months of use and less than 50 print outs, both cartridge got damaged. Since it was on warranty, they serviced it free of cost. Exactly one year after purchase, the paper feeding mechanism has become faulty. Also, the print of low quality and very slow. I think they have supplied me a defective piece when I got it in Diwali offer (Rs 7999)."
5,"If you are looking for some printer which has high quality prints, and operation cost is low, ink tank printers are the choice you should consider. Also, Ink tanks printer don't dry up even when not used for sometime. The filling of ink is also something which is spill proof. So overall and a very good purchase."
5,I knew well that HP was a good company and it proved again!! Superb print quality. Only disadvantage is that it has no adjust feature to control black and colour print. Xeroxes are  good. Any colour they give. Superb model.... Easy to install. I printed over 100 pages in 3 days and only 2ml of black was used. Ink quality very good. Worth of its price!Stay Home And Stay Safe. Buy HP without any thought! üôèüôèüòÉ
4,"Nice printer, giving one star less as it's only 1 week of using"
3,Worst HP support.... No one will come for installation or for tech assist. Print quality is better. But while printing from web page of from email the font is too low and just get printer in a corner of a a4 and no way you can change the font size. That menu option will not be available while printing from web. But printing from MS word is OK. No tech can fix this even assisted almost 10 Times with remote support. But they won send a tech to home also.... On site warranty is just fake.
4,Going through some reviews it was a bit disappointing at first but after some research I found it satisfied enough to go ahead and order it. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to install it. All you need to do is Dowload 100 + mb printer software and you're done. Took 40-45 minutes to complete the process. Only hope that it's economical in the long run. (fingers crossed)
5,We bought this printer 15 days back. It's a good one. Ita got scanner n printing option. we tried printing on a photo paper the print was good but it leaves a black soot kind of thing after sometime on the surface. Not sure it's the same with other brand.  Other than tat its good.We installed the printer on own.The person who was assigned to instal dint help us in anyway. While unboxing he kept on saying without a CD I won't touch it even after informing tat it's not needed and also not included in the box n he left. Other representative was helpful on the phone n helped us.The printer is good.
3,"A good product - - poor service.Printer is good, build quality is well enough. But please ensure not to load too many sheets in the tray, else they might get jammed.Service wise, Amazon is too bad in terms od service. The seller shipped the product with incorrect serial number, today I'm trying third time to get this one fixed with Amazon support. All they do is just send a so called note to the seller and ask me to wait and check my mail some time later.Support by HP is also not as expected. Don't try their whatsapp support, it literally sucks. My printer got jammed, I read online help, and fixed it all by my own. They reverted via whatsapp after 3 days."
3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ‚Çπ, which is excellent value."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
1,"It was really waste of money, I ordered this 1 year before... The printing speed is very slow, everytime errors are coming, it is automatically taking print size as 5*7, catridge is costlier... Only postive part is wifi connection and we can easily give print from mobile also ...I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLEASE DON'T BUT AND GET SUFFERED LIKE ME"
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
5,"Received product yesterday in brand new factory packed condition, Amazon using biodegradable packing materials which was heartening to know.No problems with the setup, it was a little lengthy though. You have to install the HP Smart app and it guides you effortlessly through the entire set up process.Printed a few pages till now, print quality in Draft mode is also good.Will review post after more usage.Very satisfied with the product as of now."
1,"Print quality is sub standard, unlike my earlier HP printer which I used for 6 years. Double side printing is very painful, and doesn‚Äôt happen automatically. One needs to pull out the paper and reinsert it in the tray. It‚Äôs user unfriendly. Paper input tray is of very low quality and the paper crumpled sometimes when it goes in for printing.On day 1 itself I realised that this printer model was a mistake."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
5,"Replaced my earlier wired HP inkjet as it was taking up too much space next to the computers and printing from different computers was a pain, with the cable having to be switched between machines.Very happy with this new 2778 printer, installation on my iMac was a breeze which was a surprise and it has worked very well since then -  more than 25 pages printed without a glitch, yet to print from phone though.Overall the printer has delivered on our expectations of an easy to install and use wireless printer.Amazon service as usual was excellent and now my default choice for office electronics."
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
4,"Compact design, easy to use, take printout and xerox. One thing I noticed that, the color cartridges provided in the box, using this we can't take printout of more than 30 papers. As it's mentioned, 150 papers we can printout in color. Don't know whether it's cartridge issue what they have provided or printer issue."
1,"Don't buy thisThis printer might cost you less but cartridges are too costly.Buying cartridges are like paying EMI for a costly printer.So better buy ink tank printers, b'coz it doesn't have cartridges and ink is less expensive compared to hp 682 ink cartridges."
1,It's only printing color even if you select black and white. This is seriously I didn't expected before buying and now I am clueless also tried contacting support but they also don't have any fix expect trying reset and asking to use laptop instead of mobile.
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
1,"The printer does not work. Installed all apps, all drivers yet it shows offline and is not printing at all.Do not buy. Waste of money and support is non-existentOne star because it won't let me give zero stars"
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
5,"Good Printer which is very easy to install and given by many videos  online. The process is very simple to install and completes in 15 mins. Its perfect for the home printings with kids online classes and work from home prints.Pros :- Excellent print quality - awesome color prints and black and white.- Excellent Wifi connectivity- Awesome ADF - can scan the 40+ pages in one go- super easy ink refill, and no spilling of ink- HP Smart app was easy to set-up and use"
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
1,I BROUGHT HP 530 INKTANK PRINTER ON AMAZON SITE. THE PRINTER PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGNING. SO MANY TIMES COMPALINT RAISE. NO USE. ONE OR TWO TIMES SERVE TECNICIAN CAME AND CHANGE CARTIDGES BUT NO USE . AGAIN AND AGAIN COMPLAINT. NEXT THE TECHNICAIN CAME AND REPLACE PRINTER. BUT FEW DAYS OK AFTER THAT PRINTER PAPER JAM AND PAPER TORN. AND NOW THE PRINTE TOTAL DEAD POWER NOT ON. AGAIN COPMPALINT RAISE. BUT TECNICIAN NOT COME.SO HP SEVERVICES IS SO BAD.It's their job to buy HP products by mistake
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
4,"I have upgraded from a Canon printer and I feel it is worth the money spent.Overall:-  Print quality is very good for normal printing. Documents color and b/w are extremely good on normal quality mode.- Photo print quality is good for personal use. It is comparable to some of the prints I have received from photo-studio. However if you are looking for high quality professional photos, this may not meet your expectation and those printers are quite expensive.- There are review comments about ink not drying on photo paper: To avoid this, you have to set the paper type as ""HP Photo Paper"" or ""Other injet Photo Paper""  depending on you paper while printing. Also ensure to use good quality phot paper.- There are few review comments about paper falling off after printing: Again I have found that the out paper tray has two stop options, if you pull it max, then paper does not fall-off.- 2 sided printing and 2 sided scanning is available, but the paper has to be loaded manually after onside is completed. This option works only from desktop, HP smart app on mobile does not provide this feature.- Online HP support is quite useful. The executive tries to help you over phone and if required can take remote access of your system to provide support.- Noise is not too much. If you still want a silent printer, there is quite mode, but the printing speed will be very slow.Printing Speed: Not as advertised but should be quite okay for personal use.Fist attempt - A4 color copy in normal quality took 1min 10 second. and Normal quality color print on photo paper took 4 minutes.Second attempt after cleaning head and alignment: 30 seconds for A4 size photo print in best quality (photo paper)Wifi connectivity: It is quite easy to setup wifi, however I had some initial glitches where the printer was connecting only to 5Gz and not on 2.4GHz. Connected with HP support, but they could not solve the issue. I reset the printer to factory defaults and after that the problem got sorted out.HP Smart App has good option on desktop, but on mobile it has very limited option for settings. This could have been improved.What I liked most:1. ADF allow me to scan/copy bunch of papers together.2. Printer can connect to both 2.4 & 5Hz network simultaneously3. Wifi-Direct option allows to print direct without connecting to network4. HPePrint option is useful if you want to print document from a remote location."
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
5,I bought this printer for 16200rs at sale with card discount. Printing speed is good.First day I had to print around 250 pages (2 sides).It costed me around 200rs approx If I had got it printed at shop It would have costed me atleast 500rs.Two issues I had noticed so far.1. For 2 side prints we have to print one side for all pages and put it back into feed. During this process I once got mismatch front back print because 1 of the first side print had 2 pages stuck together because of which mismatch happened while printing the second side.2. I have two laptop both running windows 10 out of which one laptop was able to install hp printer drivers easily but the second was not able to download the drivers. Not sure what the issue is.If you are looking for printing duplex(2 side print) in large quantity then I would suggest you to go for printer with proper duplex print where you dont have to manually print the second side.I haven't tried printing from mobile but will update once I do.Hope you find this review helpful.
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
1,Almost using the printer for 6 months and the problems are1.always showing paper size mismatch2.every time it has communication error ...al the print command stored in que and suddenly it prints all of them at once3.Takes lot of time to boot up4.Worst service of HP .....At least booked call for 5 times no body reaches and the complains automatically closed.
1,Prints very slow.Print quality is very bad in both color and b&w.Doesn't maintain proper margins on A4 paper. You have to select Letter for proper prints.Body paint peels off. Brand new printer looks like a three year old badly used printer in a week.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I‚Äôm already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn‚Äôt have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
5,"Value Product. Don't think more, just go for it. Printing is awesome and very easy to install, but you also contact hp care for installation i.e. free.Most important Amazon (Appario Retail Private Ltd) have done a wonderful job in delivering the product."
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
2,At this price segment this printer is waste of money I am totally unsatisfied with its printing and scanning quality. After 3 to 5 pages print I mark that little much ink is flow around the text and also during the scan it's pixel density is very low
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
5,Excellent product however vendor has to be bit carefull while package such crtical device. Packing was not good and high chamces of product damage during delivery. Otherwise delivery was on time.. I am happy with the product

5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ‚Çπ3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,"At this price you cannot get anything better. For those who are complaining about the cartridge life, please NOTE THAT THE INCLUDED CARTRIDGE IS A STARTUP CARTRIDGE WITH ONLY 20% INK. Please buy a standard cartridge and you will achieve your dream number of pages... Also its a home printer so do not expect a print speed of 1000 pages per minute. Overall very good investment. I do recommend.It was also received with all HP original Seals. So many thanks to the seller for sending an brand new piece."
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,"I had a problem with this defective product. The customer care was difficult in returns and replacement. High value products should be returned with no hassles. That is how Amazon US and UK or any other country functions. Amazon customer care was very hesitant. The product description had 20 pages per min for BW and 5 pages per min color prints, but it would take 5 mins to print a black and white page with a simple letter. I was not even able to print an amazon bill. The color print never worked. Amazon agreed to a replacement. The replacement arrived and I tried to print a simple BW document and it didn't print at all. The replacement never worked at all. Amazon took the replacement back with a lot of very difficulty after sending video evidences and multiple photos of their useless product. Never buy this model. I have a HP Inkadvantage 310 series and it works like butter, fast and easy to use. Never by printers with cost less than Rs5000 from HP. They sell outdate hardware."
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it‚Äôs not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don‚Äôt cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from üò∑ u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
3,Appario Retail Private Ltd did not respond to email. Wrong product serial number were mentioned in invoice because of that I could not get HP redemption. It is very bad that Appario Retail Private Ltd  did not respond to emails and willingly mentioned wrong product serial  number so that I could not get redemption from hp. Neither HP nor amazon have no corrective measures.
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
2,HiI am here to tell u about the printer i brought first i tell u cons there are many consCONS : 1)THERE IS NO OPTION FOR COPIES LIKE IF I KEEP 1 PAPER IN SCANNER AND I WANT 10 COPIES AT A TIME BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO PRINT 10 COPIES AT A TIME2) THE PAPER IS STRUCKING IN BETWEEN RODS WHILE PRINTING.3) LAST BUT NOT LEAST  THE INK CARTRIDGE IS SO EXPENSIVE 700 PER 1 BLACK INK CARTRIDGE AND 700 PER TRI COLOR CARTRIDGE AND WHEN WE PRINT UPTO 20 PAGES WITH BLACK OR TRI COLOUR INK WILL BE COMPLETED WITH WHAT INK U PRINTED . THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INK SHOULD BE VERY CHEAP BUT HERE INK IS VERY EXPENSIVE.4) NO WIFI AVAILABLE5)WE CANNOT CONNECT MOBILE SO MUCH TIME WITH OTH CABLEPROS :  PRINTER IS BUDGET FRIENDLY FOR HOME BUT INK IS VERY HIGH...PLEASE DONT BUY THIS......HOPE YOU READ THIS REVIEW.THANK YOU.
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
1,The printer doesn't include Cartridge. then i saw the bwlo saying customer also ordered comp pack. then i have ordered cartridge as well. finally there was no BW cartridge only color came and ordered again BW and waiting for delivery. its frustrating ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not good approach. be clear in your add and provide the right suggestion to customer.also . the printer box was delivered at the opened condition. its was not factory packaged. printer was not even covered properly insde‚Ä¶.im not at happy with this deal.
1,"It does not work. It prints pages in parts and then stops - or does not print at all. Have to press the black or colour button repeatedly to make it start. And whatever printing it does is done at a pace slower than a snail on a relaxed outing!! And printing is accompanied by disturbing noise line by line. the whole unit is tinny, like a child's toy - only gives no pleasure.I have never complained of an Amazon product. Could you please advise where do I go from here. How does one lodge a complaint? How to return the printer? (I am ordering another one from you.)Thanks and regards."
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
1,"After a lot of trial and error by me as well as by the technician from HP, finally the conclusion was drawn that this printer is not compatible with MacOS. Weirdly, this is not mentioned anywhere in Amazon detail page and HP has kept this fact hidden in some safe vaults which I failed to discover."
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
1,I received the HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2338 model today. I have tried many times to connect my printer with the laptop through usb and using HP smart app. It is not detecting my printer. I even tried to do the same with other laptop still not working. I think I need to replace this product.
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
1,"Not sure if they know what are they building.The printer model says 2338, it is not detected by the driver software on windows 10, m1 mac.Tried returning, disappointed."
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,"Very expensive print, not working with ink refill, every time I have to change cartridge that cost 1600, and it have to be changed after 200 print"
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
5,Best and most helpful item in printing and copying your document.After this item forget the expenses on cartridge so economical printing and you will enjoy printing after using it
5,Best and most helpful item in printing and copying your document.After this item forget the expenses on cartridge so economical printing and you will enjoy printing after using it
3,"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.3.  I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a  complete fiasco.17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn‚Äôt read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.Review Update - Jan 24- it‚Äôs been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I‚Äôll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn‚Äôt detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I‚Äôll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I‚Äôll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn‚Äôt sync or connect, it‚Äôs a waste! It‚Äôs like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you‚Äôre looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That‚Äôs true.HP customer service experience is 0/10."
5,"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.Pros:-1.Wi-Fi Range:-Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)2.Automatic Updates:-Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi RouterA Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.CartigesBoth cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper butI am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc."
4,"The cost per print is very high , I hardly went up to 40 pages and the black ink is already depleted ! , the connectivity is not an issue seamlessly connects with your devices , but the rate at which the ink depletes is very fast , this is suited for people who print once in a while and also when they need the print to be confidential which you don‚Äôt get in an internet centre. Strictly not for people who print a lot."
3,"I bought this product and returned it after 4 days.Coming straight to the pros and cons :Pros :1.Its quite affordable in a price range of 5000-5400 ,given the multi functionality (print,scan and copy)it performs true to its claim.2.Its super light to carry around. Can be moved around easily if needed as it uses cartridge which is dry and does not form bubbles as in an ink tank printer.4.Gives good prints both coloured and b&w.5.You have the choice of purchasing either of the cartridges, depending upon your usage,  b&w or coloured,in case of find it costly to buy both,and still it would function absolutely well.6.Gets easily connected to a laptop by the USB.CONS:1.The most difficult part of this printer was connecting it with the mobile wifi or wifi direct as they call it in the absence of any physical technical support and one gets immensely hassled in this process,as they do not provide any demo or at home technician service to help you connect for the first time.It requires a whole lot of things like router,dual band wifi, and though they claim and try to enable an easy connectivity with wifi,which it isn't at all.After some time you almost give up on trying to connect with wifi and simply get your work done by directly connecting with laptop which it does good .2.It is not mentioned anywhere on the Amazon app the cartridge that you get with this printer are only dummies meant for 20-25 prints ,and not the real ones.And so you need to buy them along with this printer if you have got to print at least 50 pages.3.Though its inexpensive ,but its costly in the long term as it gives you only 100 bw pages per month with a newly bought cartridge which is way less than the ink tank printers.So this printer is budget friendly,and a good deal for low usage like occasional homework and assignments of children,or ticket prints etc."
5,"very nice air-printer.. no need of wire connection..  i connect it to my wifi router (wireless) & use that printer with all devices (mobiles, laptop & computer) which connected to wifi..."
1,"Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well.  Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement."
5,"The printer is super cool. Obviously the printing cost is very high, no doubt. But at the same time you should know how to get around it. I refill the cartridges myself.. And to be more specific, I refill with the original ink bottles HP Gt 52, yeah.. The print quality is awesome. If you want to further reduce the cost, use the local ink bottles that you get at around Rs 100 for 100 ml bottle. That would be much cheaper. One bottle gives a print capacity of 1000 pages. One time refill would give a print capacity of 100 pages. So technically, the print cost is reduced to as low as 10 paise. I am still using the cartridges that came with the factory shipping and have already printed more than 500 pages consuming only 50 ml of ink.."
5,Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.
4,"Very nice product. Wifi configuration took time, but results were amzing. printing directly from phone, makes life more easy. i  was expecting this to be duplex printer, but didnt find that feature, need to explore more.Recommended product for home purpose and small office purpose, Copy and scanning is easy through HP smart app on Mobile phone. Overall nice product"
3,"I have been using this printer for the past 3 months and I am writing this review now as I wanted to give the other customers a very genuine review on this product after using it.First of all, this is not absolutely the best printer for daily use. The one and only reason for that is the ink price.The HP 803 cartridge used in this product will always give you a headache while buying a new one. The cartridges set (Black n color) will cost around 1800 rupees which is quite high for an ordinary customer, and the cartridges last for only 200-300 page prints in normal quality. There is an option to refill the cartridges after it is exhausted but it won't work after 2-3 refills probably.I used this product for my project printouts, study material printouts, making copies of documents, bills, etc in a regular basisfor the first time after the cartridge was empty, I was able to refill it using the ink bought from the Amazon.in site itself and was able to take another 150-200 printouts before it was empty again. The 600 rs ink bottles are enough for 10 refills. But on the second time after I refilled and started using, after few prints the cartridges were spilling out more ink and sometimes no ink at all which resulted in incomplete printouts and waste A4 sheets and i had to buy a new set of cartridges which was nearly 43% of the product costPROS1. Excellent Working2. Good Quality Printouts3. Easy to use3. Copy/Xerox Feature (Both color and B/W)4. Wireless connectivity (Very easy printout using phones directly: Requires HP Plugin installed in your phone)5. Good HardwareCONS1. Cartridge too costly"
5,Does what‚Äôs it‚Äôs intended to do . Setting up the app took a while but now it‚Äôs smooth . Print quality is better in this price range . Haven‚Äôt used it much extensively but whatever I did was smooth.
4,"Cartridge rate is higher except that all are nice. It is nice printer for home use and price is also affordable. If the price rate is adjusted than this is the best wireless printer. It can scan,print and we can do xerox in it."
4,"I don't know why the seller has listed this product as HP Deskjet 2622, even though what I received is 2600.Anyways, for Rs. 3999/- it is not a bad product at all. Every feature is the same as mentioned in the description. The printer comes with 2 cartridges (color and black) that was very easy to install. The print and copy quality is perfect, and fast also.I am happy with the product, apart from the fact that it is giving some problem in connecting with my phone. Once I was able to print directly from phone, and the next time, the phone showed the printer is unavailable.OVERALL: Very good product for the price."
1,"If you have no where to waste your money, this is the one. Most irritating product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The functionality of printer is hilarious and if you don't have patience, my advice, refrain from purchasing. The ink run at super fast like Jamaican Usain Bolt speed.Note: Amazon you should publish my review or don't wala such product."
5,This printer HP Deskjet 2729 is really amazing. It's printing quality of both color and black &white is very very clear and good.I like printing quality of this printer.Dislike about this printer is that it is pretty slow during wireless connectivity.But I can say that just go for it...
1,"The product is not recommended at all whether you use it for home or office.best are ink tank printers. twice or max thrice the cost but worth it and effective plus cost saving.Color photo quality is worst of all the printers (Epson, HP, Canon) i have used on kodak paper.Cartridge charges (rs. 700 each) are too high and yield is like max 40 color photos/print and 80 Black n white prints.I had some urgent need of photos so took the printer in use and all i can see is the pink color photos.Very bad experience with HP this time."
1,Worst...after 20 pages b@w ink showing low...nd dat was only documents print out..
4,"Product is really nice, I have booked Canon first, but it was faulty. So ordered this HP2622. What I felt is the plastic quality is much better in HP.First when you on the printer, connect to the printer using Wifi, then one page will open there you can connect the printer to Wifi networkOnly problem I noticed is when I put single paper, the paper does not go properly inside and the printer throws feed error. After multiple attempts (30time) figured out that the paper to be inserted below the roller to have proper feed or else the roller will pull the paper one side, this is definitely some problem to fix or what I dont know"
2,"The printer is good, but the black cartridge got over in just about 45 pages printing, not satisfied with this though, haven‚Äôt counted on the colour printing yet..."
4,"Many buyer's here complaining about wifi setup for printer is hard, Might be taken note of by HP. With hp smart setup application for mobile and desktop/laptop it was seamless experience and really easy to setup printer + wifi for wireless priniting without any  trouble. Infact, mentally i was ready to face same problem but no such problem faced by me luckily.As of now, I am not using any USB cable to take my printout, Everything via Wifi, Be it from laptop or Mobile. In case, Anyone still feels the same issue, Refer to the blue book titled Reference and Support. On 1st page in bottom you will find the solution itself.Cons -  For now only 1. Explained below.I gave 4 star because, Ink is fast depleting property be it color or black. In case you have daily print out of anything more then 5-6 pages, Don't opt for it. Otherwise, Excellent for Kid's homework and minimum printing job."
3,I've been reviewing it . After my 8 months of usage . This is a low load printer . I never expected slow print from this product . I've been looking for better one again .Pros:* Speed in Connectivity* Easy to access at low price* Compatibility* Easy to equip and less weight.* Colored printsCons:* No double side  print available* Sometimes we've to wait to load* Maintenance is bit high compare to laser jet
3,"I bought this printer for home use. The cost and features are good. You can print from mobile as well. The wireless printing works very well. The printer is quite good.Now comes the catch. The cartridge cost. HP 803 original black and color cartridge costs anywhere between 1200 to 1500 rupees. Contrary to the claim I was able to print not more than 50 pages before the ink dried. It could be that ink dried due to non usage for couple of months. However, the cost of new cartridge is mind blowing. Looks like companies make money out cartridges."
5,The printer is good obviously so no issues there but initially i was given a used product which i wasn't happy with i got the replacement and it was great. I liked the product as its compatible with all my devices as long as it's connected to my wifi. Without the wifi i can connect the printer to my laptop and presto!! It works. My advice please look up the setup videos by hp before you get started.
3,"HP needs to work on improving customer experience. It's a nightmare trying to get the drivers and getting the WiFi feature work with the product. I choose to use cable for quick printing. Print quality is ok ok. Packing was good. Comes with cartridge. For scanning, one need to have hp snart app installed and nedd to use it for giving scan command to printer."
1,"We received this product and unfortunately did not start using it within the 10 day period allotted for returns. So once we tried to use it we had continual issues printing, it actually didn't print. After many calls with HP support they agreed to send a technician after they realized it was a printer defect. The technician came and then said he would have to come back with a replacement part. After that visit he no longer responded to our calls or texts and we've been unable to get a hold of anyone from customer support. We've had this printer now for a month and it hasn't worked nor are we able to get it repaired or replaced. Terrible experience."
2,"ProsGood looking with pure white exteriorEasy to installConsLonger lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pagesBulkyWhite color sure looks good but prone to getting dustyAlways takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone appI used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in thatCartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP onlineNo resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer"
5,The colour cartridge sent with the printer is defective.So either replace the whole order or replace the cartridge by tomorrow.
3,"Printer is really good, easy to setup and operate. Very handy with print copy and scan.Unfortunately soon after printing two papers, I started seeing problem with the default cartridges that came with the printer."
5,This is my favourite product that I brought in 2019. Easy to install and use and the wifi  connectivity is also strong. I brought it for printing homeschooling materials. And it‚Äôs working efficiently plus it‚Äôs budget friendly when you manually refill the ink. You need to be a little patience with the ink filling thing. Scanning & copy also functions smoothly.
5,I bought it bcoz of brand name.And it provedGreat print quality but it could be better.It's easy to install.Easy to use.Effortlessly print.The cartridge should print more pages.The cost per print should be less.Overall it's best in its price range.
1,"Review after 1 year of use:Whenever I give any command to print, I am not sure if it will print. Sometime paper will get stuck, or printer won't connect with phone, or command is given but nothing happens.If I have to take a print for class then I ensure to get it done a day before because there is no sureity if it will print the moment you need itVery unreliable product! Would give it 0 star"
3,"A good printer for beginners or school kids, because it's very simple to setup and use, but the high CPP @Rs.5 to Rs.7 is not worth it. Will discard it very soon and get an ink tank all in one with auto duplex ADF. Don't let the low initial cost fool you, at best you can get about a yield of 100 b/w pages, so unless you absolutely need a printer immediately and can't afford the initial cost of an ink tank, I would strongly advise against buying this."
1,"I made a mistake... humble request to you please don't purchase this...Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....Cartridges too costlyInstallation easy but print yeild is very low.Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifiI requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now..."
4,THE printer is fine .service was good but the problem is..IT IS BETTER TO BUY A NEW PRINTER THAN A NEW CARTRIDGE..i always use genuine things but this printer is only worth 3 colorful pictures..that is it..even black and white depletes before 40 prints..if the pictures are not that colorful then may be a few more..HP or any other printing companies needs to see this..the manufacturing costs for this cartridges are not that much..but still it is unfairly priced..you can not heavily print at all not even lightly..that is the problem..it has to be more efficient
5,I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.
1,On receiving the printer I was able to connect the printer wirelessly and print copies without any issues. But the second time since I moved out to another Wi-Fi network I am unable bring the printer to set up more and connect the printer to the network. I tried a lot but unable to get the printer to connect to Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi light keeps blinking does not stay on.Can someone help me? I cannot return the product as the return Window is closed.
3,"Would suggest look for a notch upper hp printer. , this is for the basic home user , has WiFi connectivity for easy prints directly from mobile . Installation took a bit of time with WiFi not getting connected properly but once done then it was working fine . Too many pages get sometimes stuck though"
5,I bought this product yesterday and tested all its functions which are working perfectly. Results are very good. So far so good.......rest time will tell
1,"This is very worst product. Cartridge stopped working after 20 page print. And help line said go to service centre which is more than 90 km, and they said buy new cartridge which is 1800 INR cost. Now think guys printer is 3000 n cartridge is 2000. Don't buy this hp is robbing Indian customer s.Anyone can call meI want to sell this dabba for 1000. 2 months old.PRAFUL9818868839"
1,"Basic problem? The paper in mechanism. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN PAPER. Its a vertical feed at the rear, and horizontal out the front. Either the paper just dosen't get pulled in, OR gets pulled in titled to one side (right) and hence the printout is skewed, OR (USUALLY) the paper tilts a bit, then remains there, while the printer prints (no idea on what!) And shows the job done. In last 40 tries Ive only managed 1 print and 2 photocopies. DON'T BUY."
5,"After some settings it started giving very good results... One thing I don't like I was unable to connect the printer through otg cable to my phone, over all its really value for money, I bought it in 5999"
5,Both Black and color print quality is just awesome . What a printer it is ! It's quality is just awesome . Both color and black and white . ...... So purchase this and enjoy . You can see my review at my channel ELECTRIC REVIEW . Thanks
5,Though the printing speed is not excellent but it is perfect for students who print out on regular basis.Easy setup and print quality is also good.
1,"Initially the printer worked fine. But issue started after 2 weeks, once the return period was over.1. Issue related to paper handling. The printer was unable to pull paper properly from input tray, resulting in no printing and paper error. Seemingly the paper pulling roller was not able to make contact properly on the paper and hence not pulling it.2. Then trying to print a test page from HP printer utility, it did not print. Tried multiple times, no luck. As per the printer utility program, if test page do not print, it means that the printer is malfunctioning!Not expected from a new printer from reputed company like HP. Seems a loss of Rs. 7600/-."
3,"Printer is very good. But recieved printer with ink already filled in printer and print head already seal broken and installed in printer. The ink bottles were leaking and ink was all over the printer and booklet, instruction manuals. I don't know if it's replacement printer or old piece. After plugin it is working smooth and producing good color. As the printer is ok n running am not returning but definitely wants to give one star to the seller."
3,"This printer is fast, it prints real quick. Photo printing is also quite decent.I have tried it on Linux and Windows, both work, Linux however always prints in color even if settings are in grayscale.The ink leaks though from bottom, after that paper comes blotched on the edges.I am ok with it as my printing is not mission critical.I would suggest for a couple of thousand more, now you can get wireless inktank auto duplex printers in canon, in case you like more convenience.Overall an average normie printer for the average joe."
2,"Letter size of below 9 is not printing properly, print as double or mirror type, which is not readable. So some PDF file can't print due to its small size of letter. Otherwise for 10 or above 10 size letter, it is good."
4,"After unpacking and installation, it was not printing , raised a complaint with HP support who said that  it‚Äôs a hardware issue and the service engineer will be sent to review the same. The engineer was very knowledgable , and he said the issue was owing to a connection that would probably not have been made inside  , and he opened  the printer and he was so right. The printer is working all well ."
5,If u are looking for very rare use and ink tank and low cost printing.this is best. Just compare canon 1010 and Epson 130
4,"Good printer for value for money, good quality and value for money, cartridges are not jaming for seldom use..i use it rarely 1-2 time in a month, still working.Amazon did not provide full detail like product and serial number,i am struggling for warranty claim. the serial number provided is not working. also there is no product number on printer. waiting for amazon response..cons: printer is very very slow. in urgency you will get frustrated and will go to shop for print because it can take several minutes sometime to adjust and print so in urgency it can kill your plan....."
5,"Wanted printer for occasional printing for school work. Fits right for my expectation. Good quality print.Also printed some photos which turned out be good, though not that good.Didn't need any wifi feature, it takes just a second to connect USB wire, spending 2000 more for this feature does not make sense. Also, no need for photocopy as one as always take a photo and print any document.Will update the review after few months"
1,"HP customer service suks so bad , they bluntly said that they dont provide installation service for this model whereas it is mentioned in product video description that installation is provided by HP brand.Couldn't install it properly and couldn't take a single print.Had to return it on same day , thanks to Amazon A class service for accepting the return for this thrash from HP.P.S HP service sux better to go for any other brand other than HP"
5,"Such a nice product let us see it's all good working,!!adding after using...Best in this category and price as well..... forgot all BV colour printers and be the fan of hp115...g.. great performance and reliability as well!!!"
1,Had been facing issues aince day 1.Firstly the power button started blinking even though ink levels were sufficient and print heads were properly installed.Then one day when i had to recheck and reinstall the printheads it just won't lock even if i press the blue latch. HP is also denying it to be a manufacturing issue and hence not covered under warranty. I think the seller has to own up else amazon must own responsibly for keeping this defective pieces on their market.
4,"Review (April 2021): I contacted the helpline (1800 number) and they gave me the contact for technical helpline, which is another 1800 number. The technical support engineer spent almost 30mins in call with me to find out the problem in my printer. We found two issues: (a) the paper feeder needed some cleaning, which was easy to clean with a cotton cloth wrapped in pencil sprayed with some sanitizer (b) the black printer head wasn't functioning at all. So, I was given a free visit to my door step the next day where the technician changed my black printer head for free. The reason for printer head to not function earlier was because the printer wasn't used every week to print and the printer head nozzle got ink clotted. Replacing the printer head solved the problem. I was able to print good quality prints after this. So 5 star rating for hp support and warranty coverage. Amazing job!Review (march 2021): Prints look terrible, if you stop using printer for 2 months - Unable to fix with diagnostic tools. I don't know if ink is getting dry. The hp diagnostic tool says that the ink is not genuine. But I only used hp ink since the purchase time *(aug 2020) and I have hardly done 100 pages of print during these many months with 10 photo prints. I am unable to fix the problem.Purchase-time Review (Aug 2020): Print quality is better if you keep printing more often. If you hardly print on daily basis, occasional printouts doesn't look perfect.  You have to keep using hp software to clean the head before prints."
3,"I thought it is good printer with less speed that's all but I was wrong, it is below average, very slow and not reliable. You can't use paper more than 100 gsm. Though print quality is good till now. Paper pulling mechanism is poorly built."
3,"I purchased hp115 ink tank printer, for 5499 in amazon , printer prints quality below average i print 200 pages all the pages are  not good , i change the cartridges also but print quality not change b/w is better than color print. If you want to but this printer choose another printer ..its only low cost to buy ......"
1,"Delivered the defect printer first, and i have waited fora week to received new one. Printer is running fine,but photo print in quality glossy paper doesn't work out.the black colour is fading just even by touching softly.."
1,Useless printer.Impossible to take bothside printing. Print quality is good. But it has a paper jamming problem. Paper stuck almost every time if you want to take 8-10 pages printout which makes it useless printer.I'd not recommend to buy. Go for some better option.
3,"There's some super complex steps to assemble... during which the print head, which is attached to the main chassis through a rubber harness and slides across the width of the paper to print from left, came off the assembly.It was a nightmare to put it back. The instructions to assemble also did not include proper caution and pictures to avoid this.Somehow managed to reattach it back, and get the printer working.Has been a charm ever since..."
5,Awesome for economical printing.Best for home and small office use. Printing speed is moderate when printing @300 dpi and low speed for max dpi prints/ photos.Got 2000 prints as of now. Ink lasts for 3000 prints as per current rate.Best if you don't want additional features like scanning n wifi.Go for it!!
1,Printer is goodBut i found the product delivered to me has already been registered for warranty and only 7 months are remaining
1,"Installing difficulty from the very beginning. Because print head carriage is not be able to move, stucked to the left. So installation is not done in anyway. Company does not provide any onsite installation service in this case only online support they provide, which is all good for nothing."
5,First of all its the cheapest available Ink tank option on the market. It does the job pretty well. The setup takes a while beyind that its a breeze. Have printed 100s of pages in past 3 months including photos and looks like it sill has ink left... very economical option and certainly a must have if someone is in the market for a printer that just does what it is supposed to do.
4,"Overall, I am very satisfied. Installation was a cakewalk, printouts are very silent, fast and economical. The only reason why I deducted one star was because paper gets jammed sometimes (as perhaps it does in all printers, maybe). Good part is, you can easily pull out the jammed paper from the top, and it comes out in one piece (and it does not get torn)"
1,"Not able to start, power is not switching ON. It's been over month. They keep on telling do this do that on WhatsApp. But not willing to send technician. Please do the needful or replace faulty printer."
1,Broken printer supplied and exchange also not done by Amazon till now.The product was broken and cartilage and cable were Missing
1,Print head cap is displaced. I don't know how to fix this.
1,"Received printer today and called HP support. Followed steps she told and found that power inlet  is moving up and down. Doesn't seem right and I let her know about it. Further setup was done under her guidance, all required software installed. Printer powers up, but doesn't work . Complaint filed. Once again precious time lost."
5,"Been using for 4 months as of now, print quality is very nice (Black & white as well as color prints), Installation was hassle free, in between did not use it for more than 20 days, after giving print lines appeared but after doing cleaning with HP software Voila! it started working perfectly.Delivery came on time, Packaging was very nice.Go for it."
5,its very good for small business...u need to install some billing aap to use this machine ....at present i am using vyapar app.... printing speed is very fast and print from mobile very fast ......u need to setup it to small text
3,Bluetooth not working sometimes..
3,When it plugged for 1 hour It get heated and stopped printing
5,Its a  very good and user friendly product.  Use it with android smartphones via bluetooth. Download app mentioned in manual to directly print from smartphones wirelessly.
1,"Tried to run it with my POS device which is an arm64 device. The drivers got installed but the printer didn't print. The support team responded to my support ticket, ""Sorry, We cannot help you with that.""They didn't even tell me that this won't work with arm64 devices or I'm doing something wrong. They leave you hanging clueless. They'll close the ticket without satisfying the customer."
5,Nice product

3,"Unable read the prited receipt, printed too small, and after installing I have to paid an amount of Rs. 430. For using the driver on mobile phone."
5,"Print quality is excellent, awesome, too dark like inkjet printer.I used on dairy Shop and working good.Highly recommended to use it."
4,Greatly Satisfied with the printer and the cost of the product.Felt Print driver service for android would have been given better
3,good

5,Ok
1,Bad product
4,Simple installation and good quality print.
1,Not in stops daily
3,Ok product.not for heavy use.
4,This is a good product buy this
5,Excellent
5,Supper quality
4,Better
4,It's good
3,Printer is good but ink runs out quickly especially Colour Cartridge ink.  The print quality is good.
4,"The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. It does the job. A couple of things to keep in mind:1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.Other than that I found it quite decent!"
2,Printing quality is not good as expected. Disappointed.
3,"Writing this based on 7 days use experience.Pros1. Wifi Printer, having scanner, copy and Fax at low price.2. App based use for convenient print, scan, fax.Cons1. Colour print quality is just average.2. Ink provided along with Printer can last only less than 30 color print.3. Print speed is very slow over wifi. May be 2 paper in a minute4. Getting connected to wifi for printing is a painPersonal thoughts- My use is only 20 page print in a week currently and thus can live with this.Those expecting quality colour print, or high speed printing or print requirement is too much may search for other option, as ink cost will be too high comparing to getting printing outside.Yet to print photo paper to assess quality.More review after new ink installation and few months of use."
3,"1,Can be buy for Minimal uses purpose.2, scanner and printing is slow but reasonable price3, Worsted connection with wifi,many time disconnected , again it will take more time bro reconnect4, Print quality good.5,I purchased only for ADF scanner. That fullfilled.6, I bought 3 days before (6/11/2020) so i don't know reliability.7, cartridge - I taken 10 colour print copy but cartridge ink level shows less than 50% . May be  i can take another 6-7 copy only."
1,It doesn't have a scanner. We purchased a wrong product.It is a total waste of money.
1,"The software is very buggy. Even if paired and connected via WiFi, it does not detect the other 5 in on state even if printer is on. When detected and given print command via mobile it takes ages to transfer a single page document to the printer, and then it prints only half the document wasting the paper.. really frustrated with the printer, wasted almost half day for printing a 1 page document yet no luck..Edit: Updating review to 1 start as even replacement piece was faulty."
1,Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting. Very confused whom shall I call for the remedy. Either buy in directly from croma or Hp they provide full solution till installment and extended warranty
1,"I am totally disappointed with it so I replaced it bt after the  replacement while the verification they made cancelled so the product could not replaced. I lost my money üò≠üò¢üò¢üò¢. And product is not working properly, while printing it takes whole papers and printing will be in the corner of paper."
4,"1. Suitable for small office and home office2. Scanner is good.3. WiFi connectivity is not great4. HP smart is a cloud based app. If you install HP smart half the drivers do not get installed. Reliability is low.5. HP support was very helpful in getting the application package/drives/installation for this device. (Alternatively you can look for drives/set up for Hp 4100 family series drives/app and install)6. Post installation of dedicated app and drives, the device is working beautifully."
1,"don't waste your money on this, within 10-15 pages your black cartridge will be over, and within 10 pages your color will also over, then after that, you cannot refill your cartridge, directly you have to purchase a new cartridge with cost 1400+ for 2 cartridges, wireless connectivity also not good, also it is very complicated to use, the best thing I can say about this is DONT PURCHASE IT."
1,"It's works very slowly , I don't like it ...I ordered it but when I connected it via wifi the name of this device is 4100 I don't understand what is happing here, bit confuse this product is real or fake the blue sticker which was their above it's surface in every product in the review. ...But in my product nothing shown like this..I don't no this product is real or not ?"
1,"Printing stop after in less than a month, though used for few times. Support we code does not function. It is decoration. Down time is more than two weeks now. One gentleman  came to attend, he was very positive, but the machine was online wrongly reset by the support crm centre. Hence needs a part. Part not available becos hp godowns have software malfunction. Better avoid this product. In the first month itself, more of repair request and downtime. The company is big as they do not care for retail customers. Internet dies not recognise printer though it says default printer"
5,"I have bought this printer for my home use. It was ideal and the print quality is also good. It has wifi enabled so you will be able to take print even without connect the printer to a pc/laptop. You can directly send prints and  scan documents using the mobile or installing the HP app.Pros:* Easy to setup* Light weight* No so bulky* Premium looks* Print, Scan, Copy and Fax functionality is available* WIFI facility is available to take print/scan using your mobile phoneCons:* Duplicate printing is not available* Only white colour is available so can get dirty easily* Couldn't find the option to change the default password of the WiFi within the printer"
5,"speed of the print & cost per page print is what the major difference for model to model.At this price range, its decent one.Best for home usage(max 100-150 prints per month).Cons:* Configuring wifi is not simple(especially while using iPhone/Mac). Company can consider giving manual for the same."
3,"HP DeskJet 4123 Multi-Function Inkjet Printer with ADFThere is absolutely no documentation with the printer. The one-page instruction takes you to a website that is not helpful. It took me a while to get it to work on Windows 10. USB connection didn't work. Can't comment on the quality of printing just yet, but looks pretty average.Do not buy if you don't know what a printer driver is, where to search for it, download and install it. Ideally, such ""home printers"" should have a plug and play installation."
1,"This is not working properly taking multisheet at a time, ink drying quickly even in black, setup is taking long time and not easy to understand,Quality of the priniting also very bad, it will trouble lot to normal printer user,Service center of hp is very pathetic not even bother about the customer..."
1,"1. Waste printer.2. Why was given an Auto feeder, useless. no proper borders always scan words print cross line.3. auto feeder manual scan both sides.bloody useless auto feeder.4. installation very difficulty, HP company not responding to conplaints.5. don't buy this printer. waste of money. plz."
5,"LikeScans and copy/prints multiple sheets up to 32 automatically.Prints from mobile through wifi.Copy sheet b/w or color, multiple copy with button press .Looks great with white and blue body.DislikeTedious driver setup on pc. Not working on win 10.Mobile hp  smart app works with wifi No direct mobile printing.Drivers Not in Cd/DVD but from web download which is confusing as Model is not found sometimes."
5,"Works as expected. I'm totally satisfied with this printer. It's pretty good for home or personal use. And fully loaded features with ease like wireless printing, scan, copy and a 35 page auto document feeder. But it wolud have been better if the catrideges could have printed a few more pages."
5,Wireless printer with app for phone and email id to print from remote location. Other ways also for remote printing. You dont need any cable to print from phone or pc. Cartridge are cheap and print quality also good. Document feeder is a plus thing for hasel free copying or scanning
5,I am a HP fan when it comes to printers for home use. This is my second ink jet for home. My previous veteran was hp deskjet f 735. It served my family for 15 years. At this price I found it most economical with true wire less features. My 8 year old independently takes print. So ‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù falls short in explaining the features.
2,the printer usage and installation was good but coming to printing the cartridges will last only for 20 color prints and 45 black the consumption of ink was more and cost of each cartridges was too high each one will cost around 2800 do not go for this oneinstead go for ink tank printer though it may cost high for buying later it will save you a lot of money for printing cost
1,"Worst product, stopped working only after 1 month of limited usage, cadrige is even more worst. Only after 2 or 3 printouts it shows as empty. New one is nearly 1000 rupees. Customer care does not get connected revolves only around ivr messages. Go for any other company. I too have one Epson which is one year old, still working flawless"
3,"The printer is good, but when printing on glossy photo paper it is very slow and takes approx 5 min to print full A4 size photo page. In normal plain paper or photo copy, when printing from PDF it is very good and fast."
3,"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues. Guess it is more environmentally friendly because you will only get a print out when its the only option"
2,"When printing, it prints good but the cartridge finishes up fast though not many print outs taken.Another issue that the printer is not connected wirelessly... It connects on Wi-Fi once, then if I switch it off and on it again, I have to reconfigure it or use cable for printing."
5,"Very satisfied with this printer, copier & scanner. Good part is it comes with ADF.Best multi function printer in this range."
4,The set up is not easy how ever once done especially the Direct WiFI once set up it becomes a good product.
5,"The product was delivered as mentioned. Packaging was good. Installation through the hp app and wifi connection was a little time consuming, however not that hard. The prints are good."
1,"Does not recognise the paper size, always paper jams in the printer. Always have to cancel the print job. DONOT BUY HP PRINTERS.The color ink got finished in just about 10-12 pages. The black in another 15 or so.Never get my job done in short time. Always half an hour for just 1 print."
4,The quality is good. I found Wifi Direct setting to be a little cumbersome. It was not able to detect 5g dual band modem for configuration but 2.5 g was fine. So if one had a dual band modem keep this in mind. Else it was easy to install.
2,It's just been a month I bought this product and have us d it just twice and now getting issues with the connection issue printing issue and sometimes gets error as ink over where in ink is also there is cartridge. Really not happy with the product in just a month.
1,No support from HP at all .. the Customer Care number provide in the site is not reachable.(1800-2000-047)
1,"NOT A VALUE FOR MONEY, TOO SLOW, EVEN AFTER FRESH CARTRIDGE FEED PRINTING TOO SLOW... DIDNT EXPECTED THIS QUALITY FROM HP....Not Happy with this chosed Printer.... Too Slow in Printing. once current job done, clicking on next job print, it doesnt start printing itself, it needs to power off, on then starts, Page stucks sometimes in between. One page B&w print take 5 - 7 minutes to print. Not happy with such quality of HP."
4,My criteria was once a page print per week or 15 days also it has xerox and wireless connectivity so m happyU need to call a technical guy for setup do book in advance wd hp its freeNot tried scanning rest all is good
4,Received the product well in time. Good product in this price range. Print quality is average. Driver is not included in this package. This is creating problem linking with PC. Otherwise it is a good deal.
5,Printer was well packed with safety. Configuration of wifi with HP smart App and Wifi-Direct is easy. i button helps in getting information or you can check YouTube videos also to setup. 805 cartridges are available tricolour and black both.
4,"It's a good Printer from HP, But consuming lot of Ink. If you are using very rarely you can prefer this printer and scanner is also Good. WiFi Tech is great and we can print from phone also through the connected router which is Good to use on the go."
1,This product is not working not working I said
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,Easy to use and printing well. Since this is an inkjet printer and I know I'll be sulking down sooner for the cartridge/ink.But at the end it was my deliberate decision as my printing need is only 5-10 pages a week.So I am not much worried on that side...as I have researched that ink tables are are useful only when the printing requirement is between 300-500 pages a months. So for my usage this one is suitable. And I am happy with the purchase.I have not printed on glossy paper yet to check the photo quality but colour printing on the A4 is also pretty good so far
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
3,I dont even know what is the meaning of ink advantage in here.yeah it gets the job done.But beware if using HP software to print cause the software has developed in the manner to quickly end your ink.All the maintenance (print clean and print allignment)program uses a lots of ink.Go for hp 2331 and save money.So i bought thinking ink advantage but its just not worth trusting.
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
1,"Waste of money.I had used HP inkjet printer for 5 years, and bought this as replacement. But was in for a shock!Setting up the printer was extremely difficult.I tried exchange for a different HP printer. But that is not supportedNow, in less than an year, the black cartridge has completely dried. The colour one is still working.This experience is going to lead me away from all HP products."
3,Colour print show ios 150 page print but i not print 100 page of colour print and cartage colur alert and print not completely colour gradingOnly black cartage is value for money  to usedEvery time 850‚Çπ colour cartage is very costly so buy ink tank printer
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
3,It's print quality is good. It's very easy to use. But the problem is it's colour cartridge is running out of ink too fast. We only took a few colour prints for testing it's quality and functions. But the ink level is already below the halfway mark. And I don't think it will be able to deliver the number of copies in colour as mentioned by the manufacturer. Same is the case of black ink. Though it's level is slightly better than colour ink. Still I feel it will also deliver less number of copies as mentioned by the manufacturer.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
1,If only i could give it a negative rating. I bought it as its cheaper and seemed apt for minimal use at home. The cartridge stopped working after first use itself and now I am only able to print Black and White. I have to remove the color cartridge every time before operating otherwise print wont work. Don't buy this!
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
4,"Its good in terms of quality and value for money.I printed around 300 A4 in black and white and maybe 50 in color before ink was finished.While color ink was finished even though you expect it to print in B&W - it was printing in some yellowish color, I had to remove color cartridge to print proper B&W - HP should fix this."
4,Its a very good printer. Good quality print. However 1 drawback is the installation guide is very poor and I had to rely on google to get it installed and configure. Let us see how long it will work
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
1,This product was rcvd a month back but due to my travels I ended up opening it today and I was so disappointed to see that it has no user manual. The bluetooth is not visible of the printer even when the machine is on and the usb is not working. I've crossed my return date. But atleast help me on how to use this
3,"Everything is good except print quality . I have another thermal bluetooth printer ""maestro script 57"" which I bought nearly 5 years ago. I feel print output in hoin Bluetooth printer is weak and dull looking compared to my older thermal printer but on the other hand it can store paper roll upto 25 mtrs. And printing speed is also very fast."
3,Edited review - -  printer is working well.Received a product with accessories package was open.Initial review--Received wrong product. Got a Non Bluetooth version
4,We are using it for printing the the Apes lips which is been generated after and aeps transaction so is working fine so far and quality is good as compared to other products of this range
1,"It doesn't have a Bluetooth nor it's wireless and and it's android app is pathetic, it's all false information from the companies side. I urge everyone not to buy this product."
4,This is good thermal printer for any bank receipt printing..
2,I have purchased in May 2021 ... Now getting problem... not getting power ... it is in warranty period ... Not able to use warranty claim.
5,Simple and very easy to use. Highly recommend for small cafes and restaurants

5,The Printer smoothly worked till 4 month but after 4 month the product isn't working. Also I don't get any help from amazon customer care and also from seller.
3,The only problem with the printer is the speed of the print which is too slow other wise it is a nice product
1,"Printer print too small , & doesnot support dircect print. Totally bad experience don't buy , I got delevery to day & return it tomorrow"
1,It's a battery product not good

5,Very good and useful for me to do my job.

3,Good product üëç
5,"I was searching for a suitable inktank multi-function printer with auto duplex function for home use. Unfortunately, most of the low cost printers available in the market are single side printers, ie, no Autoduplex function was available even in the range of 20,000/-. Finally, I shortlisted Canon, g6070, Epson 6190 & brother MFP-910dw. All the 3 printer's price was around 25K. It delayed my purchase further. Meanwhile Brother introduced their new range of printers including this model on Nov-20, it took one more month to get available for online purchase.This is a feature rich printer which has more features than other cosltly 25k printers.Main features are,1) Autoduplex. It makes possible Hassle free printing of books2) Auto Document Feeder for Scanning multiple pages without any intervention.3) Wifi Connectivity.4) 2 Paper trays. One is multi purpose tray.5) Filling of ink tanks is easy.6) Easy setup pf printer.7) can print more thick paper than other printersI recommend to use 80 GSM paper for normal printing purpose. To reduce paper jamming complaints,Printed multiple A4 size full page color photos and a text book in color for my daughter. Ink level is still maintaining at 75%.Go for it."
5,"First day review - Printer is super easy to setup. BUT - if you are buying online, chances are high that you will get UNABLE TO PRINT E3 error. Call BROTHER support and some one will come very soon. This is a common issue where the wireless network card gets loose inside the printer. Customer cannot fix this and this has to be fixed by brother support. It's a 2 minute job. Prints are very nice."
4,"Features- GoodPrint quality - GoodValue for money - Definitely YesNobody gives duplex and ADF features at this price. But why did it lose a star out of 5? Because of these1. Does not have any kind of power indicator. No led or any kind of indication that the printer is powered on. You have to see the lcd screen to know the status.2. No backlight for the lcd. My 7 year old printer has a back light for the screen. But this expensive than the old printer does not have any back light for the lcd screen.3. No master power switch. This is extremely useful. But sadly this printer does not have any. You can say shutdown printer from the switch in the front panel. But that method simply shuts down the software of the printer and the control panel. Not entire power cutoff. If doubtful, shutdown the printer, turn off the plug switch on the switch board and turn the switch on again and see...the printer powers on. This is a big nuisance if the printer is connected to UPS (in the non battery backup/spike guard socket).4. ADF tray on the top of the printer does not scan both sides. It is single side only.5. Rubber buttons. The print on the rubber buttons will easily wear out.6. Fixed front panel. If the panel is tiltable vertically, that would be super awesome."
4,"The printer's core printing hardware is good. The print quality is very good so far. I have tried duplex printing feature, copied a few pages and printed a few A4 size photographs. The print quality is good everywhere. Photographs turned out to be really nice. Haven't tried ADF for copying or scanning so can't comment. But for me, the software is let down .. specifically the smartphone app. The look and feel of their main android  app feels like the work of a school project! That would have been acceptable if there was a lot of functionality in the app but there isn't. Also the display on the printer seems to be a couple of generations old along with the navigation software onboard the printer. All in all, while the printer's hardware beats the competition by offering ADF, duplex printing and good quality prints etc at this price point, the software is generations behind HP in my experience. MY 7 year old HP printer (HP 3515) which was less than one third the cost of this printer had a better onboard software than this printer. And we can't even begin to compare the app."
5,"If this printer costs one and a half times that of other similar ink tank printers, there is a reason. And it is worth it.The speed, print quality and convenience it offers over other models in the category is unmistakable.The automatic feeder and auto duplex saves a lot of time and paper."
3,"Low Print quality compared to InkJet - Prints are not sharp, Black ink is not black enough, No shine to the ink, so not good for photos. Good enough for school work and kids , but not suitable for professional submissions.The ADF is not two sided, even though it can print on both sides."
5,"Initial impressions :- Delivery took almost a week, however, the package was received untampered (considering the total weight of ~10kgs, a job well done)- First time setupThe setup was fairly standard. Follow the guide displayed on small LCD screen. Hardly takes 5 mins.Only the wifi password entry interface is bit annoying.- PrintTried wireless print function only. Standard A4 size printing is pretty smooth and fast.Photo printing on A4 glossy paper (180gsm) with fine settings took a little extra time. But, print quality is pretty good.- ScanScan using ADF is new for me. Printer does it's job nicely. However, one thing which we don't get is the scan for a 2 side printed page ( technical word could be duplex scan)- CopyLike scan, Copy function is also butter smooth.2 sided page copy I am yet to figure out.Overall, a decent printer with a decade old UI :P"
5,"For someone who's not a professional photographer, the color prints are as close to pro quality as you can get, in my opinion. The colors truly pop and the resolution is excellent. The uploaded images should stand testimony to that.I have tried almost all available functionality - printing from the main tray, from the MP tray, copying multiple pages from the ADF, scanning from the glass flatbed as well as the ADF (again multiple pages in a single go), ADP - and they all worked flawlessly.The interface with a small single-line non-backlit LCD display can be a bit cumbersome during the initial setup, but then you won't need to interact with it much after that.At the end of the day, I am extremely happy and can't recommend this printer enough!"
1,"Update : 24 May 2021Returned second time as same error in the system. Packaging is worst from seller. DO NOT BUY FROM Appario retail.First review:From first startup showing an error "" cannot print E3"". Junk device sent to me. Returning the product. Would prefer a better seller."
1,I I bought this brother printer online and in trying to connect it since last 3 months. And I haven't been successful to get through to someone for arrange for a technician to come in in and do the connection because brother people have found 2000 different ways of how not to help their customers. I highly recommend people to please find another brand which gives you good customer service.Aur buy it if you are technically confident that you can fix the problem yourself.Maybe this brand is good in some other countries but not in India
5,"Very feature rich printer. Print quality is good. In this budget other brands do not offer the features of this printer. Setup was a breeze through mobile app. The website needs more work. It was a bit daunting task to register the printer, and there was no confirmation Email from Brother. Although I got a request number.I have set it up via ethernet for stable performance. Can also connect through WiFi / USB. Overall a good all purpose Printer.Update: Got confirmation Email the next day. The product is registered, warranty activated. Couldn't be any easier..."
3,"The installation process and connecting to wifi is a pain. I have to got hrough videos on youtube rather than brother website. Inktank cost per page is lot cheaper compared to laser. If brother has good customer care and support docs, this would be a 5 star one. Got it as a deal on prime day.  Amazon sells it at a high price point now. Brother website itself lists this at 18k. MSRP and discount on Amazon now is bunch of nonsense."
5,"Best printer out there under this price range. Only feature which is not there is fax. I am sure most people would not need it anyways. Apart from that duplex printing , adf, multiple trays, borderless printing .... everything is there. Colour Prints on glossy paper hardly costs 4-5 rs if you buy ink from Amazon"
3,"Not the best I would say. First, it came with that dreaded E3 error. Then post it got fixed, still not convinced if the print is that good - I always feel its a bit washed out colors. Next, the wifi is pretty bad, to an effect that if the printer goes to sleep mode, it does not connect back when a print command is given, you have to WAKE it via restart. A lot of issues, but then you don‚Äôt get that much in a single package - ADF and Duplex Printing."
4,"Value for money. Though scanning speed and colour prints are slow, but they are of very good quality. Even pictures on a photo paper (4X6 in) are near perfect.Installation was super easy and print/scans are easy over WiFi. The s/w can be improved.Most difficult is configuring the printer due to one Line LCD screen and using buttons to go third the menus.All in all a great product for home and small office use."
5,Print quality is good Scanning is fast.It was very easy to install including Networking (no professional help required).At this price the function/features provided are truly worth it.
1,"It's sound attractive with it's specs but Brother official site display mrp 18500 and these guys selling at there wish...I got it in 17000 but has missing items inside, also missing cap on the printer ink tank. Clearly looks opened or refurbished. Returning it.I do not recommend."
5,"i will tell the features that is not mentioned  anywhere1. it has automatic function to cover the nozzles to protect them from drying and clotting, it's just awesome feature2. you can print 2 pages in a single page one side using only printer no need of mobile or computer, it's also a useful feature.at last, this product satisfied me bacuse at this price i bought it is earned in just 6 months without even changing ink."
1,"ADF Sensor not working and seeing low stock, the new price of product is more than 26k.When the price is 19k, how can Amazon allow sellers to cheat their customers by pricing the items at +6k more than MRP"
5,One of the Best all in one Printer at Reasonable Price. This Printer providing  good Pictures quality.If you taking Photo copy then It will provide little bit Fade Colours. I mean Colour will be Light. Maybe it‚Äôs Effect because of Wrong setting. I am not sure about that‚Äôs.  But as per features it‚Äôs good Printer.
5,"Though printer has arrived later, but it came with safely. Too many option available same like higher printer. Print quality superb what I expected."
5,"It's one of the best printer.Printing quality is perfect if you use above 80gsm paper.Yes,its black printing is not exactly black (4 Star) but you might not bother until you need fully black fonts.And negative comments might be due to sellers issues not bcoz of Printer.It fullfills my requirements."
1,The day the printer it was showing this error:-Cannot print E3Printing Err E300And the red light was always blinkingDid not get the 3 colors for color printing
5,"Decent print quality, easy to set up wifi. I am happy with the purchase and the printer functions."
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."

5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
1,If only i could give it a negative rating. I bought it as its cheaper and seemed apt for minimal use at home. The cartridge stopped working after first use itself and now I am only able to print Black and White. I have to remove the color cartridge every time before operating otherwise print wont work. Don't buy this!
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
4,"Its good in terms of quality and value for money.I printed around 300 A4 in black and white and maybe 50 in color before ink was finished.While color ink was finished even though you expect it to print in B&W - it was printing in some yellowish color, I had to remove color cartridge to print proper B&W - HP should fix this."
4,Its a very good printer. Good quality print. However 1 drawback is the installation guide is very poor and I had to rely on google to get it installed and configure. Let us see how long it will work
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it‚Äôs quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won‚Äôt work and give communication error.‚ñ∂ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.‚ñ∂ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don‚Äôt print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.‚ñ∂ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can‚Äôt return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance üòûüò©üò©. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn‚Äôt work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
2,"Regret to buy this Printer. There is no background light in the display. Very difficult to see what is being displayed. Print quality & Copy quality is worse than the HP Inkjet printer which I have been using. Duplex printing is not working. Since I started using the printer after the expiry of the return window, I could not return the product."
3,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
5,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
1,"Worst printer, printing quality is low.Toner come along with the printer is used one. It list only for 400 pages.If you want to buy new toner, it cost around 5000 rs and it gives only 1500 pages.To costly to print.I didn't recommend this printer.Worst customer care service.Compared to this taking prints from out side is more economical."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,Highly annoyed. The seeker thought he would be able to cheat by packaging the product in such a way that he would be able to hide all the defects. It looks rather like a 3-4 year old second hand printer. The lid was broken. The parts looked worn outThere was no cartridge and USB cable in the box. I would rather buy from official HP site. It‚Äôs also cheaper over thereThis is in addition. It‚Äôs been over a week and the return has not been made so my money is stuck so I would recommend you guys not to buy from Amazon. I am one of the unlucky guy whose money is stuck. You could be the next one. I have called Amazon more the 10 times still no update from them.
1,"Do not purchase this product. Waste of money. It is having cartridge issues. Even though I installed SETUP cartridge which came along with the product, it is showing error to install SETUP cartridge."
5,Works very well! Print quality is good and speed also good. Works like a charm on wireless network via mobile app! Not tested via USB yet.Arrived on time thanks to amazon logistics!
5,"(I'm writing this detailed review as I saw there is a lack thereof for this specific model).To start off, the grey and white combo is absolutely divine to look at and very modern + minimal. The printer is exquisite in performance. I'm not a heavy printer user so the requirements might differ but for normal printing usage - documents, project etc. this printer serves the need. After trying out all its features here are my thoughts:1. Setup (takes a while)If you get this printer, the lack of steps to be able to set it up is quite a way around to figure. I actually saw multiple YouTube videos and still didn't get the full picture. So here's my suggestion, once you switch on the printer and the light is blinking next to the power button, headover to HP Smart App on your system (laptop/PC). Trust me the phone app is not worth using for setting it up in time. After you open the app on your system, follow the instructions until the setup finishes. After which hold down the Page button and the info button together for a couple of secs to print the instructions to connect wirelessly. Once you receive that headover to the wifi connection settings in your system, select the printer, choose to enter a security key and enter the code from the print out. Once done, the welcome page will then print and everything is pretty straightforward from there.2. Colour printI would rate the colour print quality about 3 out of 5. Okay for normal use but definitely not a high quality to be printing high def pictures for sure - if colour accuracy is what you're after. But at this price range, that shouldn't be your primary requirement. A normal document with 30% images takes about a min to print.3. B/W printHonestly this is the amazing quality that I expected and it delivered. 5/5 for this - no bleeding, proper edge detection, no creases and absolute clarity.4. ScanNow one of the features that I like is the ability to scan and edit it on the HP Smart App itself. So if you're scanning some pics, you can opt for 1200 dpi (which is crazy) but it takes quite some time - at least 3-4 mins or so depending on the file. However for documents and all, 300dpi default works great and gets done in under a min. You have the option to save the scanned items as pdf or jpeg.5. Wifi accessAfter setting up the wifi direct access, it's not complicated and connects efficiently but be weary as you might not be able to access the internet on your system and wirelessly connect to the printer at the same time. Other than that, it's a pretty efficient way of getting things printed or scanned without needing to be physically next to the printer. I live in a 3 bhk and could easily connect from my room to the printer in the living room.6. Mobile accessSo you can access the printer functions from the HP Smart App on the phone (pretty much the same functions as from the system) however to actually print wirelessly you'll also have to download and setup HP Print Service Plugin. After which it's very easy to print anything from the phone. So I'll rate it 5/5 as it easily makes it more accessible.I have yet to test out the cartridge life but the above is my detailed initial impression of all the features. Hope this help! Would definitely recommend it easily for a purchase."
5,"I don't know why people complaining about the speed of the printer. The printing speed is well upto the mark, even above the mark if it is printing in draft mode. Obviously it is not a laser printer.Installation is hassle-free. Connection is very stable (have not checked USB connection). Print quality is very good. I have also printed from different devices like mobile, laptop and tablet. Only thing is that for android devices, it is by default changing quality to Normal Mode, not Draft mode.Regarding cartridge, till date I have printed 20-25 A4 pages including 5-6 colour prints, still the printer is showing the cartridges are full. Will update when the cartridges empties."
5,"very good affordable wifi printer. courier service was good. the product i received at port blair in very good condition. no damage happened with the product even for a large distance with the mainland India. second thing if u have windows 10 then there is no problem installing this printer with your computer but if u want to install it at your windows 7 then its bit hectic. i have installed this printer with my windows 7 laptop. for installing with windows 7 u need to go to the hp support website and get the driver from there. u will also need a good internet speed to download and install the software for your computer online. but using wifi service with the printer is very easy. In this printer u will get wifi direct, that means u can connect directly with the printer with your phone and give print command. for that service u need to install two apps in your phone, 1st is hp smart app and then hp print service plugin app. once the apps are installed in your phone, create a account with hp. once it is done, u can give print command from your phone for documents printing or photo printing without connecting your phone and printer with any network. print quality is also good . the best part of the printer is it supports 4*6 paper also."
1,"This printer is just a way for HP to make you their customer so that you have to buy their expensive cartridges (800 rupees) every week or so. One cartridge is able to print only 25-28 pages which makes the average cost of one page to almost rupees 30/page. This is the worst investment you can make for a printer. Don't get manipulated seeing the cost of the printer as eventual costs of running would be too high to sustain. Also, the return window closes in 7 days so until you realize how useless this printer is, the window will already been closed and you're now stuck with a useless, too-expensive-to-run printer."
4,"Good printer in this wifi catagory for this money of 5200Rs. (I got through ICICI coupon 500rs hence 5200rs from 5700rs original price). Installation is very easy but instruction sheet confusing. Just connect in wifi and give print from any pc, phone, laptop..it's working fine. Don't connnect usb cable , install HP app etc .no need. I did and wasted many hours.Ensure giving B/w print only if colour is obsooute necessary. Try to avoid full background or photo printing as it consumes more ink and soon you will see catrdiges empty.Tips: load 5 to 8 sheets only maximum in the upper tray every time.Try to order different verison of Printer without scanning function. I ordered this and later found scanning not at all used. Online class scanning can be done through phone appsOverall I am satisfactory."
4,"I have it now for 2.months and I used it for 100s of printouts on recycled papers,good quality A4 sheets and also on Glossy sheets for printouts of pictures. Everything is good just that it eats up a lottttt of coloured ink!!! I had to change my ink cartridge thrice in just 2 months!!"
4,"Surprisingly, within 2 months of buying this printer, it has started giving problems!! With a 1 year warranty u don‚Äôt expect this at all from a renowned company like HP!!Work is being affected due to the printer not working and we have to spend money on outside printing work! Don‚Äôt know also wjom to contact for services n repairs"
3,Very cheap material used for paper feed tray holder. It was broken on first use to hold papers.  The two pieces that hold the paper tray to an angle were already broken. Packaging was not sealed at all.Interestingly printer was wrapped in a plastic cover making it look completely unused but it is hard to say if it is a refurbished or reused/returned product.Print Head alignment does not work easily.
1,I had huge connectivity issues and the there is no response from service of Hp . Pathetic . Don‚Äôt buy
3,I ordered the printer on 21 April. I have hardly printed 60 - 70 pages mostly in grayscale. And the ink has dried up. Both black and tricolour ink dried up within two months itself.(I have already replaced the black cartridge on 21 June). This is unacceptable as it claims of printing at  least 400 pages. I would want a replacement of the cartridges.

5,"For medium printing, this works well & easy to install, light weight. So overall a good printer for Home/ small office work."
3,"Printing is very slow, especially when connected via wireless, print quality is OK type, good enough for emergency use"
2,"The quality of the print is good but the print output from each cartridge is much lower than what is indicated for the product. Even after selecting greyscale (black and white mode), printing in draft mode, the colour cartridges are running low on ink."
5,Product looks exactly like the photo. Installation was simple and easy. Printing speed is great. Overall good printer to have for home use.
3,Printing is very slow and even many times wifi connectivity issues.i would say this printer won't work as expected
5,Very good for home use.I am enjoying it well.Refilling shops are very less for this catridge which is the only problem I saw
5,Good print quality but installation process is very mind disturbing because when we want to give print via our mobile and at that time you have to face many problem in installation.
3,Suitable for home printing. Printing done only after connecting to computer. Wireless feature does not work.
5,Struggled for initial setup.. Later it's a smooth walk.
5,Best for Kids School print
5,Hoping that cartridges would always be priced economical as the name suggests.
3,The product software has many bugs. Always facing problem in connecting with laptop. The print quality is average.
1,PRINTER MAY BE CHEAP BUT INK CARTRIDGES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE AND DON'T LAST LONG.

3,"Have been using the product for a week now. Some important observations are as under:- The product looks are appealing but build quality is very low. The plastic used seems very weak and fragile. The printer is light weight but at the same time 'delicate'. The upper glass flatbed cover is so thin that i could barely hold it prevent it from breaking.- The installation is easy. Wifi connectivity is also not a problem. Have a broadband connection at home and was able to connect all my devices through the home network.- Cartridges are not very expensive but at the same time they are small and nit likely to last long. Better to have a spare set in hand.- Print quality is average. Not very great but satisfies daily use home requirements.- Printer is slow and bit noisy when the cartridges move. Not much of a problem.The biggest advantage is that you can print from anywhere in your home without physically connecting cable.All in all a good budget printer for home use. But if you are looking for some extraordinary results and features, look for something else."
3,"Writing review after 3 weeks of usage. Was easy to set up. Canon's service number and email mentioned here did not work so has to call Amazon customer care and they give a new number. Installation was scheduled in a day but I managed to do it before canon's engineer visit using steps mentioned on net.Disappointed by ink capacity. Coloured ink cartridge is already at 40% level after 20 print outs. And, black at 70% level. Faced paper jam issue as well.Will update review after few days."
1,"The printer is good for homeuse and should not cost more than Rs. 7000. Canon website has listed this for Rs. 6885 but seller Computronics Multivision has listed this for Rs. 9200 as on Aug 18 2020.When product was delivered, even the MRP was scratched out."
4,"1. Product Delivery: Rating 5 - product was delivered 1 day ahead of scheduled delivery date. Good job Amazon.2. Product Build Quality: Rating 3.5 - product is a little fragile and needs careful handling. Could have been better.3. Print Quality: Rating 4 - noiseless smooth printing/scanning/copying. Quality of print is good enough for both B&W/Colour. ***Have only tried WiFi printing & scanning from mobile using canon app. Works seamlessly like a charm. Good value for price range.4. Ink Cartridge setup: Rating 3.5 - Had a little bit of trouble inserting the black ink cartridge. Took multiple tries and some time. Could be a little frustrating for some users.5. WiFi Setup: Rating 5 - This is the best of all. Was able to setup within 5 minutes. No hassles & works wonderfully well.*** WiFi setup is best if you have a WiFi router already setup at your place. Please review my images as I have a WiFi router at home connecting my Android TV, laptop, mobile all on the same network.***Overall this printer is a great option for home and small office users.*"""""
5,Quick printing. Very good for home use.
1,"Useless. On opening the carton I found none of the security tapes in place. This aroused my suspicion. And I was correct. A defective non-functional machine had been sent. However, Amazon arranged for immediate pick-up and cancellation of order. Thanks to Amazon."
1,It was nowhere mentioned that installation charges are extra. Seller is not transparent in his dealing. This is atrocious. Amazon should take note of this and give directions to sellers to be transparent mentioning clearly the extra charges to be paid by the buyer. Now canon is demanding Rs. 650 for installation. This could be so simple as plug and play also. But we cannot take chances in this type of cartridges as Seller or Canon may say warranty is not applicable as installation wasn't done by authorised person.
4,"The built quality of the printer is really good. It is easy to set up and has a wifi connectivity option which I might say should be defacto for all printers. Coming to printing quality it's just average. Does the job, do not expect professional printing results. If so look for other printers, this one is not for you.Printing speed is slow and a bit noisy when compared with others. If you want the working cost per print then for B/W it's 2rs avg and color is 12rs avg."
5,Good quality printing with compact size.Easy to install.Economical printing.Can easily print from any android phone.Better than hp printer in printing cost.
5,Good and affordable printer for normal office use . The print quality is decent enough and I have faced no connectivity issues yet ; as most of my printing is from from my phone it serves my purpose well enough . Using it in my office for last two months without any complain . If you want a good wireless printer then I suggest you go for it .
1,"One of the worst printer ever.... I have hardly taken 2-3 prints and there is this orange light flashing on the printer, which means there is cartridge issue..Within 15 days I have to buy a new cartridge costing Rs 700 for black ink... If still the issue will not be solved I have to purchase a colour cartridge for Rs 1500.00Please don't buy canon printer anytime.. all the printers of canon are pathetic.."
5,"It is a little bigger than I expected. Installation was easy, the steps were quite clear.Only 2 wifi bar is displayed although the router is nearby, but that doesn't affect the printing or scanning. Overall it seems good, but have used it only for a couple of days now."
4,"Prin quality is OK.. connect this printer with mobile/PC by tap the mobile button of printer & open your pc/mobile wifi & print directly, it works like hotspot.. Nice feature..till now it's working well.. Let's see ahead.."
4,Its value for money and good one to use....easy installation and worth
4,So far good after a week purchased. Will update later about more.
5,Good printer and quality of printing is also good.Consumption of ink yet to calculate
5,Printer is good....U can go for it!
4,"Scan quality is great but print not so perfect but good,maybe due to ink quality.Overall the printer does the job."
1,Printer was fine until all of a sudden it doesn't power on.  Worked for about 6 months.
5,Good quality as expected. Packaging was also good.
5,"Cost of Refill is the only worry. Otherwise the printer, quality and working all seems ok..."
5,"Especially with the video guides, It's extremely easy to set up the printer and connect it with the phone and pc. I am very satisfied with the print quality. The printing speed is good in this price range."
5,a very reliable easy to use piece of kit
5,Very Nice
3,I have just took 15-20 colour prints and ink cartridge light has started blink on printer. So it means we can only take 15-20 colour prints with one cartridge.
5,The product is good in use and with good Wi-fi But installation is somewhat Hard
1,Both cartridges had been removed and taken from package.
5,Easy to install and access the item
4,The printer is very well connected with WIFI + has good value for money. Build quality is nice. Its just that the B/W print could be better. Its very dull.
5,Superb quality and economical .Everyone who has low printing jobs must purchase.Amazon service always good
4,Easy to install. Useful for home use and school projects
3,"I think the paper feeding tray position to be even better, because it some times fails to pick the paper automatically"
1,"Print quality is not good at all, ink gets used very quick and printing process is very slow. There is no sharpness in print"

5,"Good disign and very sterdy. I have been using it since 1 month, works great! Also printing speed is very fast."
4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it‚Äôs quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated.

Tiltable control panel for easy access.11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don‚Äôt have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won‚Äôt even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it‚Äôs a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can‚Äôt get everything in this range)4.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won‚Äôt work and give communication error.‚ñ∂ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.‚ñ∂ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don‚Äôt print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.‚ñ∂ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can‚Äôt return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance üòûüò©üò©. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn‚Äôt work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
2,"Regret to buy this Printer. There is no background light in the display. Very difficult to see what is being displayed. Print quality & Copy quality is worse than the HP Inkjet printer which I have been using. Duplex printing is not working. Since I started using the printer after the expiry of the return window, I could not return the product."
3,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
5,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
1,"Worst printer, printing quality is low.Toner come along with the printer is used one. It list only for 400 pages.If you want to buy new toner, it cost around 5000 rs and it gives only 1500 pages.To costly to print.I didn't recommend this printer.Worst customer care service.Compared to this taking prints from out side is more economical."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
4,Bought for Rs.2099.00. Print quality is good. Low cost printer. Cartridge ink quantity is low. Best used with a CISS(Ink tank) as shown in photos.
4,"The delivery was really good and fast and it came in a proper package. Nothing was damaged. I really like the printer because it has great print quality and is easy to use..Not much complicated.But the cartridges in the packing are canon pg745s and pg746s which are small size..I have taken 11-12 colour prints and now the indicator is saying that the colour cartridge is finishing. So I am really disappointed by that. But overall its a really good product.This was my first printer so I like it very much. The total prints I took are 55 n now its saying tht the cartridges r empty..PS. U can take 5-10 prins even aftr it says the cartridge is empty!Tips- Buying new cartridges every time is going to be really expensive. I have had the printer for like 8-9 months now, so if you are looking for a cheap option buy good quality ink and just refill the cartridge! It works wonders!"
1,"A most unreliable printer. One is never sure whether it will just go ahead and print/scan or come up with a number of excuses.Keeps on giving Low Ink warnings when there is plenty of ink left in the cartridge. Prints hardly 25 pages on a set of new cartridges. The built-in adapter makes sure that the whole machine goes kaput in case of a power surge, because you cannot replace only the adapter."
1,"noisy, returened after purchase."
1,"Very very very worst experience with this canon printer I had this is my 2nd time to buy and return this product it has used cartridges, without CD no warranty card nothing.open product full of dust and fingerprints are clearly seen on this product such a bad experience this printers has given"
1,"The packaging was superb, the delivery was smooth and the order arrived very fast.  The only problem was the product was defective.  So I sent it back and got a replacement.  That was also defective.  So had to return that also!!! What more need I write about the quality of the product?"
2,"You have to buy a cartridge every time, which almost cost 25% of the printer pricing every time for a single cartridge. It is better to buy an ink flow printer rather than cartridge-based printers"
5,one of the Best printer right there in  Market if u are gonna be under 2500 RsBest for home usageand Photo Copy and Scan is Too fluentDont believe in FAKE REVIEW just buy it without any thought‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èCartrige Refils are also cheap and Good than The HP oneBETTER TO GO WITH THIS THAN HP deskJet 2131üëçüèª
2,Print quality I like but packaging and moc wasn't so good
4,"Pros : 1. Prints are great2. You can print in 'High' Quality3. Scanner is great for home use.4. You can modify it to tank printer if you are tech-savyyy.5. It can print a card also, ie. visiting card or else. Obviously you should not expect to print Masonite Board.6. It works fine with local printer color also.  You can find it in amazon.7. It is so easy to use as xerox, my granny now using it.8. Canon software support always great.Cons : 1. You can not do 'Fine' print.2. In each size of page 1.5cm will be blank. You cannot avoid it whatever you can try with software and page size.3. Larger than A4 cannot print.4. Obviously printing color-consumption is high, it is Inkjet.You can buy it if you want to use it in home only."
4,"Honest Review- I have been using this printer (MG2570s) for a couple of months. The print quality is good. This printer mainly focus for home purpose so dont expect much. Printing speed is bit slow that too if that is a colour print it will consume lot of time and you need to note one thing is that it will not Print from top to bottom tip of any page, itll always leave 10% space in the bottom of the page not sure why it cant print the bottom end of any page . so if you're going to print anything from top to bottom end of paper make sure u resize it.Coming to the Ink deatils, i used the stock ink which was good. but that will run out way quickly if you print in High Quality. If you want to buy a genuine ink that'll cost around ‚Çπ800-‚Çπ900 for small catridge both color and black. Alternatively you can fill using local Ink to it (hope you have seen some YouTube videos) but the printer will always indicate that its running out of ink even if u fill ink in your catridge. Cannon will force you to buy a new Catridge at on point.Scanner is a plus. scans image/docs without any issues.Overall i would say its an OK product. make sure u download the proper driver from website has a bunch of tools will be available for photo printing, if you're looking for low cost home printer definitely go for this."
1,Very bad fine Cartridge.... Change cartridge...loss of many
1,This is not printing anything when it enter paper in it comes nothing is printing on the paper
5,"Value for money. I've been using the same type in my home country. You get a black and colour cartridge inside the box as well, so no need to buy the cartridges separately, however I added my purchase with each black and colour cartridge for backup. I'm using it for my son's school task and to scan/copying personal files"
5,"loving the quality of the printer...recommended... u can go for it... cons- size of the cartridge is too small for professional users.. but we can hav a rectification for that too... so without any hesitation u can go for it....just buy this and use from ur hand... don""t go through any reviews..it beats the quality of epson higher end models literally...."
5,THE THING I DIDN'T LIKE THE MOST THAT I DIDN'T USE THIS PRINTER MORE THAN 1 MONTH BUT THE PRINTER'S CARTIDGE IS BEEN DAMAGED AND NOT WORKING PROPERLY.AND I AM ALSO HAVING 1 YEAR WARRNTY OF THIS PRODUCT(PRINTER). SO I AM PLEASE REQUESTING YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR MY PRODUCT EITHER CHANGE IT OR REPAIR IT.
4,Fulfill my requirement
5,"Dear friends,After buying this printer cartridge cost goes high So,  you can refill your ink cartridges with the help of YOUTUBE.  All over printer is too good.Thank you."
2,"Print quality is average, it is typically hard to use an inkjet printer like this. My bad experience goes to value for money as the printer which I received, was damaged and non working. First, I decided to return but then I thought to complain in customer care. An engineer came up in my shop, did something and it starts working.Dear Amazon, please complete a proper quality check before you packs the products for the customer like me so that the customers like me, could leave some positive feedback.Thanking you,"
1,"Dear Guys don‚Äôt get cheated by buying this product. Don‚Äôt see any of the other comments, my personal feedback worst printer I ever had. I took maximum 10 sheets print and the cartridge emptied. You will be spending all your money for buying catridge. Don‚Äôt buy this kind of cheap product at all , I missed the opportunity of return, due to COVID I open the box after 5 days..."
4,"Good product with budget price. Compact and lightweight. Only issue is The cartridge, company provides 2 cartridges in the box which are 245s and 246s. These are Small capacity cartridges and do not last for more days."
3,Ink consumption is very high  one full Cartagena unable to print 20 copies colour.30 copy of b&w.
5,"It would be good to mention that the capacity of the ink cartridge is low - can only print about 60 pages, after which a new black cartridge costing approx Rs 650/= is needed. Buying a colour and a black cartridge will set you back by about Rs 1,150/="
2,"Even though printer is reasonable, it catridges cost half of the printer's price. And the main thing is, if someone is buying for occasional use please don't buy inkjet printers. It will get damaged if it not printing daily."
5,One of the cheapest printers available in the market and it's worth every penny. The scanner works very well and the print quality is also decent. The software is also pretty swift and easy to use. Cartridges last longer than HP printers. Overall a must buy !
1,Most worst product I used just twice or thrice and it's stop working. Don't waste money on this product
4,Print quality is good for home usage. Setup was easy but take a long time. Latest laptops don't have cd reader so drivers need to be downloaded from website. Once setup it's easy to use.One negative feedback is for seller. They sent used ink cartridge instead of new one. Black ink was empty even before driver installation
1,Printer is defective it is not working not giving any print one light of power on/off is blinking others are not quality is very bad not liking other that that black ink cartridge is not working it is dry not giving any ink i m very dissappointed with this product not expecting this from amazon kindly return it
1,Don't fall for the affordable price of the product. The cartridges are too expensive to buy and they last very little. All videos related to refilling the cartridges also don't work. At least none worked in my case.
1,"I have ordered this product but found this printer is not detectable in my laptop . Later I have figured out it's a problem with the printer hardware data cable port but everything is fine with my laptop . Such a sheer waste of time , effort and money."
1,This is a waste printer.I hardly took 8 pages  and then the both cartridges (black and colour) were finished. A cartridge costs around 600 INR and it only lasts for about 7 to 9 prints. I don't know why canon is selling such a worst product. I request you not to buy this product.
4,Print quality is good (not recommended for people with studio profession).Original ink cartridge cost way too much so one should refill them manually with substitute ink.
3,THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD TILL THE CATRIDGE IN IT BUT AFTER CATRIDGE ISOVER THEN REST OF FEATURES DIDNOT WORK AND ALWAYS ASKING TO CHANGE THE CATRIDGE EVEN TO SCAN. SO I SAY NOT TO PREFER THI TO BUY ONLY TRY TO PREFER INKTANK PRINTERS
2,Printer cost is cheap compared to other.print quality is good.but the major disadvantage is the cartridge gets empty within 20 A4 size prints company should look into it when they claim that the cartridge last for 100pages also the cartridge prices are expensive
1,My cartridge ran dry after printing only around five pages. Replacement costs around Rs. 500. Canon should withdraw this printer from the market.
3,"After printing 35 pages it gives black ink warning. But in product details, it is mentioned that with one cartridge of ink you can print 200 pages."
5,Excellent product meets all requirements q zzz
1,"Total waste of money as I got fully damaged box in rain and broken parts in printer inside. Evidences of Repackaging done and seems used product as product is full of dust. Warranty card, product book are torn."
1,Terrible experience. Not getting installed itself. I had bought an HP printer which was very easy to install - started working as soon as I plugged it in. I feel cheated on purchasing this canon product. Useless product.
5,Printer is good but catrige ink is showing half i have taken 20black print only
5,"HP 319 ink tank printer review -1. Purchased for 9700 Rs during Prime day sales2. Delivery was done next day of order.3. Installation process is quick and easy. Many YouTube videos available. Can ho through.4. Print Quality is Excellent and great.5. Scanner is very fast. Scans and prints within 20 sec for B&W and 40 sec for Colour6. Printing speed is ok. 7-8 Prints for B&w per min and 3-4 Prints for Colour.7. You will receive 2 Black ink bottles of 170 ml each which will print minimum 8000 pages of b&w practically which is very decent. Tricolor bottles of 80 ml each will print upto 3000 - 3500 colour pages of decent quality.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 310 or 315??Because it has 2 ink bottles of 170 ml plus blue design. 310 and 315 has only 1 bottle Rest everything is same in all 3.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 410,415 or 419???319 does not have Wifi whereas 410,415 and 419 has wifi and you can print from mobile and will cost you minimum 3000 compared with 319. I dont have any use of Mobile printing and hence opted for 319. If you want to buy Wifi Printer, go for HP 419 as it is top model and 2 ink bottles of black with it as in case of 319.Why not Epson, Canon or Brother ????I liked the design and sturdiness of HP Printer and there were negative reviews and feedbacks about these 3.So i hope my review will be one stop guide for all of you.Thank You üòä"
1,Service provided by HP is very poor .don't buy this product .I bought this printer 319 ink tank just 15 days back I have got a printer with damaged color print head .HP  company is neither replacing my print head nor providing service ...I feel am betrayed by Amazon and HP company am planning to sue them I won't leave them that easily
5,Great product I love it very much. Cost saving easy handling WIFI printings gives a hassle free operation from mobile devices or from your computer/laptop even you can create a unique email id with HP and send email like FAX on this printer from anywhere in the world and it gets printed.
5,First of all thanks to Amazon to gave me a quick delivery..This printer is1.Easy to handle2.Easy to install3.light weight and reasonable size4.Easy to print and scan5.Printing speed &Wireless connection Printing is low .Totally Am happy with this advance HP419 model printer.
3,"I am using it frim past 1 year.After 1 year Printer Head will stop working i.e. immediately when warrenty ends.U have to buy a new one of Rs.3500/-.Also you need to take printouts with a regular interval not more than 7 days, otherwise Printer's head will also stops working."
4,"I am using HP 5811 for more than 2.5 years. Now I am using this HP319 from August,2020. Print Quality is same. The problem comes after a few days with Black Prints as mostly we all take black prints more than color. Still, it is surely value for money!! You can use it 2 and half years / 23000 pages yield which comes first. More I can say, It is much better than Epson Tank Printers, which I used earlier."
4,"Good things:- Looks great!- Build quality is great- Input and output tray folds inside the printer. So you can cover it up properly when not using. There is a cover to protect the input tray when the paper is not kept, this is very useful to prevent dust and particles going inside.- Spill free ink refilling- Good quality print. Photo prints are good too. But this is almost similar to cheaper inkjet printers.- Installation process is not that difficult- Makes less noise and vibration while printing- Scan and copy speed is very good.- Claimed page yield and per page cost is very less. Should be a very economical printer.Bad things:- Black print head started showing error the next day. I called HP support, they assigned the call to the local support partner who came and replaced the head in the next working day. (I called them Saturday and they came on Monday). I didn't wanted to raise replace or return to Amazon as the replacement printer could get some issue too. Overall I'm happy with the support. This is a good thing but the fault is under the bad things list.- Print quality is like any other inkjet printer, nothing special (at this price point). If you need the best quality black prints, go for laser printer. Not a bad thing but I just want to set your expectation.- The driver and main printing software called ""HP Smart"" is only available through Windows Store. In one of my laptop the Windows Store is not downloading the app (not sure what is the issue, I tried tons of troubleshooting steps but none of them worked). From HP support portal you can download basic driver and printer software but the experience will not be the same as the HP Smart.- Ink Tank printers are expensive. This is similar to any Officejet printer with an additional tank and ink flow mechanism till the print head. Wireless models are too expensive, Rs. 3k extra. I wanted to buy the wireless one but paying 3k is not worth it. If you are someone who use computer all the time there is no point of buying wireless one. You can easily connect the printer with USB cable and print. Wireless printers have mobile printing feature which can be useful for some people but not for me.Recommended things:- Use good quality paper. Cheap papers can result in ink bloating at the edges of the lines or texts.- Keep the printer covered properly, save it from dusts.- Use the printer regularly. These kind of printers are not recommended to be kept at home without using it for long time. The print head, ink pipes etc. will get dry and you need to spend on maintenance.- Use HP original inks, those are not too expensive."
4,Light weight.. easy to use .. perfect for personal use.. print clarity is awesome.. only one issue it doesn't have a software installation cd. If you are unable to download the hp smart app in ur pc follow the instructions by support. Hp. Com
4,"The printer seems to be good, easy to install and quality of print is also good. It has been a month of usage, and so far no issues.I had purchased it for 10.5K in May 2021 and installation was done based on video shared in WhatsApp by technical support team. I am able to take printout via OTG connected to Android phone as well. It also works with windows laptop connected via USB, I am yet to try with Mac laptop. I am regularly using it as ink tank printers have to be used regularly on daily/weekly basis.Pls go through your current & future needs and based on that purchase the correct type of printer - inkjet /advantage, ink tank or laser"
2,"Initially Installation was a problem. The Guide given alongwith the Printer is wrong so wasted lot of time in installation.Whenever giving print command, after 7-8 pages of print, paper gets stuck. After pulling paper out, printer does not give remaining prints. So has to give print command again for remaining pages.Many times gives blank paper in between."
5,Really useful Printer forlow cost printing.It does not take too much time while you are doing print text/documents whatever may in Color or Grayscale.For this thanks to Amazon and Seller and off course delivery agent for their wonderful job.
4,"As per first use it's easy to install and quality of print is good, see after more use how the product is responding and the performance.I got 2 blank ink 170 ml and 3 color ink 70 ml but the printer whire is very short hardly 1 mt it should be 2 mt minimum. I not happy üò¢ with printer usb cable very short rest all is good.Thnks hp and amzone delivered the product on time."
3,"It this range , printer should have at least 10 pages tray.. what is the point in putting each time putting single paper .. I take 8-10 prints every day but every time I need to stand near printer to put single sheet üòü"
5,"It‚Äôs a wifi printer, No duplex scan, you need to perform scan manually.Ink tank printer, clean print quality, value for the money.I was confused with Epson,but HP 419 has a small screen to give info regarding the print.Best for home or office usage."
5,"I'm writing this review after 1 month of usage. I'm a Property Lawyer and have to prepare lots of bonds, deeds and other legal instruments apart from this profession, I'm a photographer by Hobby. So I was looking for a Printer that can print office documents as well as sharp photos and after so much research I bought this. Fully satisfied with the product. The difference between 319 and 310 model is that with 319 you will get two bottles of black ink that will serve you for 1.5years while with 310 you will get only one bottle."
2,Poor print quality for photos. I purchased one week before and was very eager to print passport size photos and other photos at home. It disappointed me unconditionally. All my room decorating plans with photos collapsed. Please go for epson or canon than chossing hp
2,Colour print is not fulfilled expectations { money waisted } and less printing size options are available  . For color printing it is talking time  in between you can go and take one cup of tea in same time. Very Bad experience I had after 6 months please don‚Äôt waist your money
4,The product is good. But at first driver was not installed from Windows store. In that case you have to download and install driver manually from the hp website. Next point is Pathetic quality in phtocopy resolution is too poor in this case. Default scan resolution is also 200 dpi. If you want to sacn in 300/600 dpi you have to change the settings every time. Print quality is superb. I am missing my canon mg 3670 for auto duplex printing.
4,"The printer is really good as per my initial impression. Very easy to install and use. Talking about the features - A4 size printing and photostate, color printing quality is good and printing output time is very minimumal (approx 5 to 15 seconds. Just one thing is missing on this price range which is WiFi printing as one always need to plug in USB with printer on Laptop/Desktop."
3,Cons1) Prints 3-4 pages in a minute.2) Scanning a page at High resolution takes almost 3-5 minutes.3) Copier is also slow.Go for Epson wireless instead.
4,Overall satisfied..... Good product... looks wise very cool ... light weight.... easy to fill ink and easy to install printheads ..... but if u are not tech friendly or have no knowledge of PCs laptops then it could be difficult for u to download and install software and its drivers.... though tge guidelines are very clearly mentioned in guidebook.... now coming to print quality its ok ok... if u are using it for small scale purpose then i would recommend but if u gonna use it for printing photos then the quality is ok type... rest budget wise review i will update after using for sometime...
2,"think 100 time before you place the order online.  I brought this product, later I realized that this product has no wifi connectivity. I understand that it's not there in the product description.  I tried to get it replaced with the model with wifi but replacement is allowed only when product is damaged."
2,If someone buy this product. it prints is good. but its head ink supply pipe is many times gets air bubbles and facing irritated .be careful bought this product.ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
5,I like HP printer .printing quality is very good nd easy to install ..but this not a good quality photo printer .scanning is also good .
4,"After the usage of 3 months I nearly printed 700 pages, ink tank of the black colour reduced to half,I doubt that company can meet any near of their claim of 15000 B/W prints.It is quite possible that they are having the claim of 75 dpi print while 300 is very good.If you are printing in 600 dpi then it will use a lot.1200 dpi print takes very long to print I observed around 5 mins for 1 print."
1,This printer was mentioned as wireless. On installation it was found to be USB. Scanner is not user friendly. On the whole I am very unhappy .
3,"Printer head problem , in two years I hv replace it two times."
1,I searched for Wifi printers. This printer came up as result. I ordered. On receipt I found that this printer is not wifi capable. So disappointing! üò¢üò¢
3,"Everything is Ok with the Printer, except for PDF documents. It does not open up directly. We need to go through Adobe. This printing service was available after HP rectified it online."
4,This is my 3rd printer from HP over last 20+ years. This one was easy to setup and use. The printing quality is good and works very well.
5,"Very good buy. Didn't get any discount,thats the sadest part.Print quality very good. Since July I have been taking at least 10 pages every week and could not detect depletion in ink level."
5,Easy to setup.Scanning and copying is good ;printing is a little slow but good quality of printouts.Arrived earlier than expected so Yay for Amazon!
5,"le lo bhaiyon, saste waale se zyada peace of mind rhega (na ink cartridge khareedne ki jhanjhat na hi ink sukhne ka darr).. 1.7 saal se ink hi khatam nhi ho rhi iski aur abhi bhi ek bottle black ki bachi hai. I am preparing for Upsc so printing acchi khaasi ho jaati hai 1200 approx pgs print ho chuke hain till date."
2,"print quality good and paper feeder take 5 to 10 sheets ata a time. also no wifi ,not value for  oney,its a shame to hp"
1,dont take printer papers not taken print worest printer hp in world
5,It is a good product. You have to follow instructions to install it yourself else call installation service. I was able to do it myself. Print quality is good and can give a lot of prints based on volume of ink provided.
3,"There are 2 main problems1) Connecting wire from printer to computer/ lap top is very small, should be minimum double then what is given.Co should send bigger one to us as it is making lot of problem.2) Receipt given with printer is not clear, Should send new clear receipt"
1,Printer needs to replace colur printouts are not coming and Amazon refused to replace
3,"The supplier has not provided the installation CD apart the printer is good, but without cd installation sucks....print is good n print is performing upto the mark"
2,Text smudges away when highlighted.. Photo paper print left ink marks on my hands even after 24 hours.
5,The machine has more RAM than comparable models. Hence it is able to print faster.The scan functionality is supported by a good software.It has a cover for the feed paper so that as to protect the paper in the tray against dust.The machine also turns on fast. I have used models from another popular brand and find hat this one performs much better.
5,I got this before 9 months i am using it form my small office business. Trust me this printer is perfect in every way. We take every day 3 to 4 copies. 8 to 10 prints and 3 to 4 scanning in a moths. very clears prints. i refilled 1 time
4,the printer is a bit heavyDoesn‚Äôt need much space to place the printerPrint quality relatively very goodFast printingEasy installationNeed to down the user software from canon websiteEasy onlyGot it a bang on deal for almost 10.7K
3,the profile on this page says that this printer is duplex (both side printing) but in reality I am unable to print both sided so could you either explain me right way or change the information already provided immediately
1,"It was a very bad experience faced with the Canon MF 3010 Printer. I could not able to print after my 64th Paper.Following are the issues I faced after that.1  Faded prints came for near 10 pages after that nothing is printed.2  After the advice, I tried to change the Toner Powder, No luck nothing is printing3  I have been asked to change the drum as well. But the service team is not confirming that even if I change the Drum.4  I have been asked to change the Catridge itself for the new printer.Asked Amazon Agent about the product and they are not ready to solve it."
1,I received it this way
5,I have the same model and using it for thirteen years without replacing any spares. Excellent printer from Canon. No paper pickup problems or paper jams. Please keep the printer protected from dust and other foreign small particles like used staple pins which if accidently get inside may cause paper jams. If paper gets stuck please follow instructions by the manufacturer to get it out the right way. Pulling the paper the wrong way may aggravate the problem. The paper pick up roller should be cleaned when necessary. Printers are electromechanical devices with sensors attached to perform the necessary functions. Dust and moisture are both enemies which may cause problems in the long run. So avoid them as much as possible. Careful occasional vacuuming and blowing will keep the printer in good condition. While changing the cartridge be careful. Do not do anything by force. The cartridge should gently glide in the rail without any obstruction. Recommend the seller as it was delivered on time and in perfectly packed and new condition. The price could be a little discounted.
3,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.
1,Damaged product
1,Its all you can aske for in a Monochrome Laserjet Printer. Simple to operate and good quality scan and print. Let us see how many copies the cartridge gives as it's shown as 'Starter'. Felt cheated in the deal though as the Output as r product description is shown as color. whereas it's a MONOCHROME printer. Didn't expect this from a Canon Dealer.
4,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."
3,Very difficult to install by searching different videos on YouTube. Still i couldn't do it. Not started using after trying a lot.
5,I have been using this printer for several years now and this is my second purchase. That should explain what I think about it.
4,Printer is good.. but is makes lot sound while printing.. .. 10 k is ok for this product.. for 12k it is waste
1,"No colour options, not suitable for my requirement, if I want to replace with other models which has colour options, Amazon says not possible. Waste of money."
5,"So far my experience product is good. Price is really low.It is useful for home & small office use. print quality excellent. Packaging is excellent , I expect more good products from Amazon.  transparent & hassle free service  .Also I will recommend for friends & relatives to buy product from Amazon"
5,"- Printer doesn't occupy much of space .- Prints Efficiently & prints are crisp & bold even in Toner Save Mode .- Start-up or warm-up time is less than 5 seconds .- Easy to setup like '' Plug & Play ''All features - Print , Copy & Scan work efficiently .However if Wireless Printing could be provided , it would be cherry on top .If you want to buy a affordable multi-function printer , this is a safe bet ."
3,Printing problem occurred after 6 month of very normal use... Print speed is fast but does not print properly.
5,Excellent for rapid mass monochrome printing.  Can stand considerable abuse and keeps working.
2,I purchased this printer and I recieved a defective product. The printer prints at a very light copies. Also I am not recieving the service for the same. #Pathetic Canon..
5,Hood
1,Installing problem
4,The printer is very good but if you are planning to make it wireless with your raspberry pi then you will run into issues. Canon ones aren't usually supported by CUPS printing service and its a night mare to try to setup.So take this if you are plannign to use a separate print server or as a standalone printer. Doesn't work with raspberry pi.
1,It seems that it doesn't support legal size
5,As expected the printer met with my requirement. Found user friendly and value for money.
5,Everything of the product is perfect but the courier takes too much time to deliver the product and the service support of canon at Bhopal is fabulous.
4,Nice
5,Good product
5,Good product
4,Only 100 pages print with and again refilled
1,Your deliveried printer is not working. Loss for money. This is very bad
5,Best in market in this price range
4,Print quality is very good but print quantity is not so much refill  it every 6 to 700 pages.
4,First class but wireless connection is not there
3,The printer we received within a span of one week itself we have to refill the cartridge and then its showing a drum problem that also we already replaced... The item is not meet our expectations....
5,Perfect home office printer; great deal from Amazon. Super performance; printed about 700 pages in one go and worked like a high end heavy duty document printers.
5,Good  Experience best quality print
1,It didnt work since the input of first pageThe very next page got jammedReally had a bad experience with it
5,"Printing , scanning quality all are top notch.The setup is easy build quality also is premium. Highly recommend."
4,Very good and useful.
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
1,"I've tried setting this printer up over Wifi and USB cable. Through my Laptop and my smartphone. No matter what you do it won't recognize or detect the printer. It is unusable.Ridiculous for a Rs. 18,999 Printer. Completely useless.Update: Just to give you an idea, to take scans on this printer, it asks you to enable your location (GPS) on your smartphone, and create an account with HP. You have to wonder why. Throughout the setup, it keeps asking for your location. After over an hour of struggle I managed to set it up on my smartphone, but no matter what I do, my laptop cannot use the HP Smart App to connect to this printer regardless of whether I use the Wifi or USB options. If I try to log into the built in web server on the printer, the password I am expected to provide is wrong. This is so ridiculous - because I am connecting to it over USB!!Don't buy this printer! if you must buy one from HP, by a different model. My 10 year old printer works effortlessly, but this is a piece of junk. I didn't have a great impression of HP, but now its hit a new low.Update: part of the problem is there are limited instructions, and some of it is incorrect. This printer says it supports 5Ghz networks but actually it supports only 2.4Ghz. If you are trying to set it up on a 5Ghz network, it will never detect, and won‚Äôt even tell you that is the reason. If setup with the HP app doesn‚Äôt work, just use your built in software. Their app isn‚Äôt needed except for mobile devices,  and I feel they mainly use it to collect data on you üòû"
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"

1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn‚Äôt work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,"I installed the printer today post delivery, realised that the WiFi receptivity is WEAK relative to my earlier printer. Luckily I have 2 WiFi connections at my place, it eventually got connected to the second WiFi Router (the routers are in the next room). The printer has reasonably good Scan and Print quality. This is my preliminary feedback. Will update after few days of working. I have by now tested every feature except FAX in this printer. The SCANs are just beautiful and quite fast. TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY .."
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
3,"Printing quality is good. Printing 2 sides of paper option not able to findScanning feature is not great. When scanning from hp Application on Laptop gives hard time. After  clicking scan button, we need to push paper little bit, how accurate we keep papers before hitting scan button it doesn‚Äôt detect, little move is mandatory after clicking scan button. And scanner is also very slow in scanning papers. Recommend 60% to others."
1,Cartage is too costly.. don't buy
1,Within a month toner low indication. Catridge not available in local market. Original catridge cost around 4.5k. Dont buy. Dont buy. Waste of money
2,"Printer cost is cheap but maintenance cost is higher than other printers. It is not for official purpose , it is used in home for kids project."
1,"Printer cost ‚Çπ17,500. Initial toner was exhausted within 50 print out. New toner is chip type for this model and cost ‚Çπ4500. It's kind of trap from HP to keep chip in Toner. B/W Print/ Xerox  cost ‚Çπ5 per page"
1,"The worst printer that I have ever bought! Right from day 1 issues, service is bad, support is bad. Very truly bad experience. Paper Jam issues, could not print even a single page. Used other printers, never had even a single issue. Don't recommend, stay away from this printer. Utter waste of money, down the drain!"
4,Scanner and all other functions work well. Wifi printing also works well.Duplex printing is not automatic ‚Ä¶ papar needs to be feed again‚Ä¶Paper tray not fully covered. This may cause harm in long run.
3,"Poor build quality. Too much paper jams. I brought it just for the ADF, that works fine. But apart from that the, paper jamming and all its irritating."
5,Not send warranty card
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."
2,HP should have given auto duplex printing in this model. People who are buying beware of it even-though ADF is mentioned in the spec. Such a basic feature is not available.
5,Product is good quality no doubt but some time I face the problem to connect with wifi.
5,Excellent
3,"It does not have automatic duplex as claimed on Amazon site. Also its all features like booklet printing, two sided printing, customised page printing cannot be availed on Mac. Air print just offers basic printing"
1,Please do not buy this printer.  Because when the toner is completely exhausted you have to buy a new one.  Toner is expensive.  This toner is fitted with a chip. New toner is not available in the market to buy
1,I bought a new one but still the printer is printing half prints and tearing the pages I also clean the cartridge several times but still is not working well I bought a month ago hardly I printed 10pages yet
1,Worst printer please don't take
1,The printer doesn't scan its cartridge and giving the same error again and again.This is the condition of a new printer. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,I did not get it my USB cable and all with printerOnly power cable i got it
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
5,"Does what it says, cost effective"
1,worst product hp brake my trust in three month printer is not working properly and the are not giving us service they told me to courier the cartage to bhopal i talked to bhopal service center they told me it may take atleast 15 day i m getting suffered a lot
1,Only positive is easy to fill.But print quality is horrible. Tried all diagnostics mentioned in document. HP support is also very bad.. at the end they will say you are not using authorized ink fill. Very expensive print..Don't prefer at all..
1,"Printing issue every month. Bad printer. Every month we need to call customer support and get imaging drum replaced. The servicing is also pathetic. It takes 7-20 days for the issue to be resolved and that too during warranty. God knows how bad it will be after warranty. That's not all, you have to follow up on the complain multiple times to get a reply and then again follow up to get a resolution. If you are really interested in this, please hire someone (to manage and follow up with HP support for all the problems you will face every month) while ordering this"
5,"The build quality was fair, but value for money. Print quality is good. Wifi connectivity is good."
2,"Our purchase date is 22-06-2020, so the waranty period ends on 22-06-2020. This printer is not functioning properly currently and we had contacted HP customer care for the repair and came to know that the warranty period for this product has expired and we were informed that any service from their end will be chargeable. This is very surprising to us as we had purchased it on the above date. We were informed by HP that this product was not updated by the seller ( Amazon ) and because of this we are facing such problems. You are asked to update HP about this product immediately, so that we can receive their free service within the waranty period. Please send us your confirmation after this is shorted out and also take necessary action so that in future your customers does not face such problem"
5,Xyz
5,"I was pleasantly surprised with the performance of this printer. I was earlier using a Deskjet printer and in comparison, this printer is a lot faster.I typically use printer to print office invoices. It used to take me hours to do this activity on my old printer while now it takes me hardly a few minutes.Printer is very fast and print quality is great. Setting up the printer was quite easy and the HP Smart app makes it very convenient to setup and use the printer."
1,The driver cd is missing
4,"Printing quality is very nice. But installation was not so easy. Amazon should allot service for installation or better you can buy in offline store. Ink filling was little risky and it's very hard to remove the cartridge. But you can get help from HP customer care by an video call like me.Worth for buying.Good for billing or single side printing.Looking for laser printing then you must try this.A quality product. Go for it, highly recommended."
4,"The printer build quality is OK. Not heavy duty and we need to take good care of it. At this price, its a bit expensive. HP should include a proper sized printer cover to protect it from dust. Wifi based printing and its setup is super easy. Once you make the printer discoverable on network, you can print it it with almost any device anywhere in your home. No dependency on physical connection apart from power."
5,"Its compact in design & print quality is sharp & clear. Tried for grayscale & B&W photos & text as well. However, printer setup is slightly confusing to start with as I had to decide whether I want to use over wi-fi or USB. However, I wanted to be used over both. With some re-installations & some setting change, I am able to use with both at same time. While reviewing, I haven't taken many prints, so mileage is unknown."
5,Easy installation and works very wellIntegrated feature to  add toner powder from top without having to dis-assemble anything (instead of having to change the whole toner cartridge) marks this model from others in this price bracket.
4,"Although I just bought this printer a few days ago, the warranty shows only nine months are left. I have no clue on why it is so. Amazon should keep a tab on resellers and ensure customers get the full one-year warranty. Otherwise the printer is quite good."
4,"The printer is really good and easy to install the instructions given are really easy to follow and it can be connected to different devices too. The printing quality is also good. The warranty and ink cartridge can be available by scanning the code which is attached in printer's body, so it's easy for us in future too. Like this product"
4,"The ""best quality print"" Feature does not work. It's economical n fast because of the cheap refiling cartridge made available."
5,Easy to setup. Amazing quality print. Though this is only one day after the use. I hope my perception will continue on this product
3,There is no toner with this printer. But customer questions-answer section has confirmed that it will also have a toner.
5,The best feature of this printer is ease of use and easy to fill ink . Print quality is good and speed is fast
5,"It's such a relief to have a reliable printer....After past experience with a cheaper, well known brand of printer that constantly let us down, this printer absolutely brilliant. It was easy to install too!"
5,"Works well as per promised, nice quality and fast too."
5,Best in this range
1,Installation difficult.Attention Light kept blinking for long. Stopped after very long by itself.The Top cover is not fittingNo prints are coming on paper.
5,"No need for  transfer documents received in mobile  to laptop or pc,can easily print them over wifi or via google cloud print"
5,Good printer.  I did not use for 3 months due to corona. Still no issues in printing. Good product. Print quality is good
5,Overall good product one of problem no customer support on phone. They offered only virtual support
1,The extra toner cartage is missing
1,Heavy printing cost.
3,the outer box of the printer was in very bad condition when it came. The printer is good but has some printing issues when comes to printing labels.
5,Started using it with my Macbook pro..Wifi wireless command for print..easy to use .. print quality good
5,Good one
1,Worst printer ever expensive printing rs 2 per page
5,Good easy to Use üëç.
1,Don't buy
5,Good printer with WiFi
2,Only 500 prints and ink level has reached half.Fake promising of 5k prints
1,Fast time hp said that no of print 5000But actually it's print 1000 so costing is high.
2,You are really chiting campany in hp printers 5k no printer500 page in one toner very badAnd very cast one page
1,"It worked fine for around 2 months. After it has printed around 500 pages, the toner level showed half and the prints started coming out very faded. I thought perhaps we should refill the toner. So I bought the genuine toner refill from HP website  and refilled the toner. Instantly the ink level showed 100%. But the print quality remained the same.I called HP support and after 45 minutes of call, the engineer said that the print head seems to be a problem and an engineer will visit me.I waited for 8 days, no one showed up. I called HP support again, they said contact TVS Electronics in Jayanagar, Bangalore. I tried calling them at least 200 times.. on various of their phone numbers listed on HP website and google. No use.I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!I wasted 20K on this printer, just because I trusted the HP brand. Another printer service centre ( who doesnt service HP Neverstop ) told me that this is a bad printer .. most people have print quality issues with this printer."
1,"Printer is not giving 5k print. Don't buy this. Nearly 500 pages comes out which add cost of ink too much in later stage. I believed in Hp promise but its fake. Within 1 month , i have filled 4 times. 500 pages per 1 fill.. Don't buy this."
1,"False claim of 5k prints,but in reality only 300-500 prints.Toner is also very expensive."
5,"Looks like a cute mini photo state machine.Need Windows 10 minimum for Desktop Computer. You must have a router and a Wi-Fi dongle in USB of Desktop. If you have Router then It is good else Windows 10 can start Hot spot with wifi dongle. You can buy dongle from near mobile store or from Amazon. An active internet Connection is compulsary to install setup files. Little bit network technical knowledge is needed.Just type web url for desktop and scan QR code from mobile camera. Link and QR code are printed with books received with the box.This printer can work as photocopier, scanner and printer. Only black and white.Extra cartridge not found but one cartridge within printer with full ink found.Value for money."
2,false promises of 5000 pages only 2500 pages print.this printer is good in quality and system but company claims first purchase 5000 page print. But printer print 2500 pages.
1,I purchased HP Neverstop laser jet MFP Printer - which NEVER WORKSand there is the POOREST SERVICEIf HP wants - I can donate it to them free - Its unused - they can fool someone else tooShekhar Patil -70 year old - have lots of experience with printers in my life9820212303
5,"I have been using the product since month.It is genuine, brand new and good quality printing.Very simple to start with wireless access in this price range which is very accomodaing."
5,Nice product üëåüëç
1,Horrible...... only one page is print and need to restart for printing every page...
5,Best multi purpose scanner printer.I am using hp printers for 20 years now.Now hp is in less plastic movement so this printer do not need to change whole cartridge. I can just refill it. Original refill pack is so much affordable now.I bought this printer for my office last year. And now bought it again for my second branch office.
2,this printer is good in quality and system but some ink problem one tonner can't print 800pages
1,Ink refil pump missing and CD driver
1,"This is very worst product from the manufacturer of H.P.  I never seen this type of bad functionality.  From day 1 it created problem.  Print quality and functionality is worst.  I request every customer not to chose this product.  All expectations were collapsed.  Seller not accepted to return back even requested immediately after purchase.  HP Company never provided any technical service.  I lost Rs.18,000/- for purchase of this printer.  Print quality is too much bad.  Seller advised to contact HP customer care, but Company of H.P. never responded to provide customer service.  This is very very very very bad and worst product of HP.  My rating is 0 star to this product"
4,"Taking print-out from android phone was flawless and very convinient. Establishment of wifi connection between phone and printer is very smooth. No specific app is required for printing from android phone. I have used Samsung J7 & Samsung A7 for this.But it was very difficult for me to install HP software in my Lenovo laptop having OS Windows 7 ultimate-64 bit via USB cable. Not a single software downloaded from official HP site viz Install Easy, Full Web Version, Version for- IT person only was successful. Later it was automatically installed by Windows update. No customer care mentioned in the documents are correct. I have received no call from HP regarding the setup/ installation of the item."
3,"This printer arrived with a leaky drum. What's more, the page count seems to be 24 more than actual (either zero not set correctly or used before shipping). The drum eventually got replaced through HP customer service, but getting through to HP and getting decent help online was a frustrating experience. So well over a month after purchase (of which the delay from my end was about 10 days) the printer is now set up and functional. And satisfactory so far. The ID printing option is convenient.Two disadvantages:1 The paper tray cover is very difficult to put in place and is really really irritating2 it does not print legal size (contrary to what the HP customer service told me on the phone). There is a range given for paper size but essentially you will be using only A4."
1,"I DONT LIKE THIS PRINTER SCANNER, THE PRINTER IS GOOD BUT SCAN QUALITY IS VERY POOR. AND IMAGES ARE CROPPING IN ONE SIDE. MEAN FULL IMAGE IS NOT SCANNING. I AM GOING TO BACK THIS PRODUCT."
5,"Good printer. Works well out of the box. I had some issue with wifi as my router didn't have a wps button. I was able to setup wifi printing by connecting to the printer using usb. Prints are good. If you don't need color, this is certainly a great printer. Able to print well using phone and windows laptop."
3,"Pros:PrintingSeamless setupCheaper refill costCons :It‚Äôs missing Ethernet ,Lacks auto duplex printing (not claimed, but still saying to clear if someone have doubt),comparatively weak WiFiPoor picture printing (might be due to wrong type...but not that great )Google cloud printing support is going away in Dec 2020"
2,"I don't have issue with the product only that I think I received a used product, as I'm trying to register for warranty but it's says already registered 4months  back ago. And the toner indicator shows already half have been used."
4,Very safely amazon delivered the product to my home... relieved my apprehension.
5,"If you are buying this with cloud print in mind google is removing its support for google cloud print for windows after December 31, 2020. Check google cloud print for an alternate solution. If u have apple products you can use air print with this.Other than this if you want to print directly with wifi direct it works flawlessly."
5,"It is almost an year now since I purchased. For people looking for black and white prints with reasonable good quality and affordable price, this is the printer I recommend."
1,"I am sorry to say that I am unable to use to this product due to there is no driver in the packet. As per written life-let I have to download it from Hp support, the website provided by HP for solution and supporting. I have tried so many time but even fruitless I am at the present. I need help to set up this printer in my desktop to use it.Thanking you."
5,"I HAVE SMALL BUSINESS, AND I FACED DIFFICULTIES TO CHOOSE A PRINTER BUT FINALLY I GOT GOOD ONE.. THANKS OTHER REVIEWER AND SELLER DESCRIPTION ..."
3,After refilling with original HP toner the printout is not good at all once it is refilled.
4,"It was said that back to back printing possible,but only manual possible.Anyway it is possible to print back to back.Black cartridge is not available in the HP store"
1,Printer is not good and so customer support.I complaint about bad printing 4 lines are printing at horizontal layout . Not solved until now
1,"The product has decent print quality, but as with every HP product in the market, refills of toner and cartridge are not available. Please buy printers where you can get a refill easily."
3,Ye printer jis usb port pr lgakr first time install kiya jayega usi port pr chlega otherwisw nhi chlega
5,"I love this product. print quality is good, non-erasable. fast printing."
5,Easy to install and use.Good quality bill prints for our POS software
4,Printer is very easy to use and worth for value paid
5,"I love this printer. This is the 316 All in one. It doesnot have wifi,so it's not a wireless printer. But the best part is that you can buy a small connector OTG for connecting your android phone with this printer, download the HP Print Service Plugin app on your phone and get to printing directly from the phone. The print quality is good. The print outs don't come out at the same speed as they come out of a laserjet black and white printer ( i also have a Ricoh black and white printer/scanner/copier). One coloured print out takes almost 40-50 seconds. It's small in size and the coloured bottles come along with the printer. The 310,316,319 series is a series of non wireless printers with not much difference in their functions but instead difference in the amount of colour bottles given with them. The 410 series is truly wireless and you can buy those only if you have much use of a coloured printer daily and you want to invest over 10000 bucks. You need to take a printout once or twice every week for the printer ink to not dry. I have been using this for almost a month now and it has been working wonderfully. The only thing i have been not been able to resolve is that i can print not directly from my Gallery of phone but i have to use Google Photos app to get the print option. I got this for 8100 rs in prime day sale so it's totally worth it.. delivery was smooth and fast and the printer was received in very fine condition. Good job Amazon.Edit after 2 months of use: The printer started showing paper jam error. We followed the instructions on the HP page to resolve the problem but there wasn't any paper jam anywhere. Called the customer care number after sign in with the email id and they promptly sent an engineer to resolve the issue.( In actual the cartridge was jammed.) He told us the paper roller is not working,placed an order immediately and within 2 days the new part was put in the printer, with the printer working properly again. So full marks to HP for their customer service, although I didn't expect the printer to develop a snag when we have been using it very carefully."
4,Installation is quite tough. The software and driver's not available online for this printer and when I connect through HP Easy Start it detects HP ink tank 310 instead of 316. No proper instructions given in user manual not clear pictures to remove dummy print head and how to insert color/black print head.. otherwise it's good products..print quality is not up to mark but that's ok for this price..
1,"This is worst product i ever purchased from hp.First of all my old ink adavantage 3545 cartridge based inkjet printer prints much superior quality than this and with faster speed this printer prints 50 pages in 90 minutes.Ans also company claim of 4000 black, 6000 color pages goes wrong i have printed 1500 pages and black ink got depleted whereas color ink got half. (was printing a book only)Duplex printing is a joke. When u trying to do so, started with ok but later random pages printing."
4,Verry verry good product.Cheap in the best.
4,"I really liked using the HP printer printer. I bought the printer for 8499 rupees.And this model of HP is the new model.And the black ink bottle that is given here has ink here 170ml which is what other HP printers have 135ml I am getting a big benefit here I am getting 170ml bottle here.And with that I got two little books. It was nice to use, but it would be better to use it for the house.E-print is a picture that takes a little longer to print very well but the picture is very good. I printed my family album in this HP printer and it is printing very well with  inkjet photo paper paper. But one complaint I will make here is that HP Ray is commenting that our color ink can be printed in 8000 and black and white can be printed in 7500. I think this is a complete lie. It is impossible.Another thing I don't like though is that or this problem is with every printer. If I don't print for several days then the print heads get jammed. That's a big problem. I think the company should fix something.............. have used this printer for 20 days and I have shared with you as much as I can find out about this printer using these twenty days. Thank you."
3,"Previously used canon ink tank printer, which was far better than hp in colour production,not satisfied with scanning quality also, feeling bad for not opting canon again.Yhink twice if can't compromise the printing quality"
4,"Good printer for document only , not for photo page, you can also take print from mobile through OTG cable , I already tested with android device using type C OTG cable"
5,"I am writing the review after using it for a month.PROS:Reasonable CostEasy to use - I tried by connecting to the system via USB and connected to mobile via OTG cable. Both are working fine. I am using third-party software when connected via OTG and all is good.Black & White print is good. Clear, crisp print without any markings.The color print in A4 size paper is really good.Color Photos using 200 GSM 4*6 are good, but not as effective as photo studio print. The color is touching the hand when I selected the best quality, but the photos are looking good.Left unused for 15 days and the printer worked without any hassle.CONS:Unable to get a printer cover, but didn't find any so far.When connected via an OTG cable, HP software is not working.Need to place the printer in a proper place as the color tank is attached as an extension to the printer.If you can spend some more money then go for the WIFI model so that you can do print from anywhere.This printer is not having Auto Duplex printing so need to do it manually page by page."
3,"Really difficult installation process and no one helps. Sent many messages for HP, emails and phone call. But no one helped and I actually had to do it myself."
1,Worst printing experience. 1 out of 15 papers get stuck inside the printer and we have to open the printer to find torn paper. Don't waste money buying this printer. HP support is complete waste of time and they don't give you any resolution. Stay away from this printer at all cost.
1,"i bought the printer two months ago & it stopped working all of a sudden. I have raised case with HP, however there is zero response from the HP. every time i call support center they says i will get a call within 24-48 hrs, and guess what.. u never get the response from them. I 'm regretting, so dont want you guys to fall on the trap. HP has worst after sale support, pls go for canon or other vendor."
5,"Sorry to add this review after a week but this is a must buy product.I love the printing quality of this printer.I have received my printer in just 4 days. Packing of the product is same as you buy from a shop it includes everything, Wire, ink bottles , instruction manual. Although the colour ink bottles will fill your tank only once and If you fill full ink tank then bottle will get empty in one go but black ink bottle is bigger then coloured ones so you can fill your tank twice. Installation is also easy you can watch the installation on youtube videos.All an all i love the product."
1,"This product has unreliable wireless connection, which maybe lost if you are not paying attention. Once lost, any print commands you may input are met with an error and would not be cleared unless you restart the printer, else printer status may appear busy perpetually. This was about the frustrating operating experience, 10 pages took 2 valuable hours of my life.Now considering I had spend 2 hours of my life of a few pages, the least I could expect is a good print quality as a reward for my tiring efforts. Alas! The print quality is mediocre at best. I've only been able to print out 10 actual pages, but my ink tanks are already 20% gone! Why? That's because of all the mistakes this dumb printer has made during the printing process. 2nd half of the page disappears! And not to mention the whole bunch of ""test"" pages I'm stuck with, which I didn't even ask for! I could've even printed a whole novel with the ink and pages that I have wasted with this printer.This review marks the end of my short relationship with HP products. Adios."
5,Very good all in one. Got in the sale at 9499 less cashback. Colour and bw prints are very good. Scan takes sometime but result is very good. Can buy for home use.
5,Pros:  Cheaper than other 310 series printer  Good print  Delivery was fast with in 3 daysCons :  Made in CHINA  No wifi
4,I'm writing review after using 10 days well it's money worthy and also the quality is very high but I have faced little problem while installing the driver and search for driver on website because it not comes with CD. And this is easy to use. But I'm waiting to see will this print  6000 to 8000 pages as written by manufacturer.
1,No installation support by HP
5,"Very Good Printer, print quality is excellent, easy to install, no sound during printing.Fully satisfied.One can always rely on HP brand"
3,"The printer takes a lot of time to print, oreven take a copy, the print quality is not satisfying. Just because it's an ink tank, the price is fine but the print quality is really degraded. I have was using an HP printer earlier but it's quality was much better. Regret buying this. You can buy this if you want to Compromise on quality."
1,The worst thing is that about this printer its very slow have to wait for 50 sec. For one print. Not recommended for bulk print.
1,will never deal with Hp one of my worse experience after buying printer.please urge people not to go for HP
1,Horrible experience plz don't buy HP printer of this model. They don't support for home installation.
5,Excellent product. Watch print head installation and ink filling on YouTube.
1,Rcvd a broken printer. Its ink tank is attached awkwardly. It was broken during transportation.
4,Reason for only 4 stars is this printer isnt plug and play for windows 10...Need to install drivers which is slightly a hectic job when all rest of the companies provide plug and play drivers
5,"It works well and very fast enough to make question paper at affordable cost. But, only thing I don't like about it was that it do not comes with wi-fi connectivity."
4,VALUE FOR MONEY.... I THINK IT IS BETTER THAT EPSON INKTANK PRINTERS  COZ IT  IS MOST CHEAPER ITS HEAD IS ALSO BETTER AND AVAILABLE AT LOWER PRICE THAN EPPSON
1,"Received Fake HP printer, I came to k ow about the same after 11 months when the serial no of the printer didn't match when I have to service the same.Even Amazon didn't supported me."
4,Printer is good. Mobile printing via USB is too slow like a snail. Colour print quality is average.
1,Scanner in product is worse
5,Printer is the best from best choice when you buying a ink tank printer under 11000
1,Don't purchase this printer...1st of all very slow then sometimes it just forget about the pending prints. Then you have to restart & again commend the print for your requirements.
3,Paper stuck during printing. Speed is slow. Cost is ok
1,"Within 2 hrs of purchase i realized and experienced that running cost of 6075 is BOMB. In a rate of if you keep printing 10 pages Blank and white and 5 color daily., cartige will drain out in week. So, maintenance Cost would be 6,000 Rs per month., as good as buying monthly printer.Other issue:Makes lots of noicePrinting is not crisp, has shadesSlow printingDemoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast."
4,"It was easy to install. Took just 15mins to complete the process. Print quality and speed looks okay.They provided only starter ink cartridges so I suggest people to not judge the printing cost per page by using starter cartridge.Need to check after using originl cartridge for the cost effectiveness.Overall, I found this printer good. It is the only model with auto duplex (2 sided printing). So I am happy about it."
1,"Cartridges are outdated (just like filament bulbs in the age of LED bulbs). Check the cost from HP itself:Cartridge: Rs 5 per page (see below for more)Ink tank: 18 paise per pageThere is no comparison !!The above cartridge cost as per yield of the HP 682 cartridges ~ 480 pages (Black & White) & ~150 pages (Colour). This is like a petrol car giving 30kmpl in city traffic. It is less than half. If you get 200 pages (black - Rs 792) or 75 pages (color - Rs 972), you are lucky.HP is fooling people by still selling the cartridge printers. These are best seen in museums.~*~"
5,"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done."
1,"The printer looks fancy, but thats it, never expected this kind of cheap quality of printer from HP ever.1. Printer says dual band refused to connect to 5G network, it would find it but wont install/ configure it. Finally connected with 2.4G network.2. Scanning issue- sometimes it will do it sometimes it wont respond, as if it has a mind of its own3. Software/ firmware issue in the printer, checked through its EWS page and firmware seemed updated still the printer will just become numb suddenly, in 3 days i faced it 3-4 times, the power button at the back will not work as well and it just sits tight. Only option is to remove the plug from power outlet, then reconnect and works well but again you dont know when it will stop responding.will not recommend this to ever, the paper extender to hold the paper is quite filmsy and the paper will fall on ground after it complete this printing."
2,"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel"
5,"I ordered HP DESKJET PLUS INK ADVANTAGE 6075 yesterday (July 26, 2021). Got delivery today from Amazon.Came in a nice box, the overall quality for HP Box was decent. But, Amazon wrapping on top was a sheer disappointment as it was partially opened. Hence, I recorded the video while unwrapping.Installation took about 10 to 15 mins.Had to be careful while Installing the cartridge, as the second lid isn't intuitive enough to open. Thought I might break something.Works very well via wifi connectivity, as well as USB. I prefer wifi as there are several devices at home.PROS:Simple to installVery good quality of scanning and printingThe HP SMART app is superb - simplifies workflow for PDF creationVery cheap cartridgeAccepts various paper sizes also good for photo printingAutomatically goes in sleep mode, if idleGood wifi rangeCONS:The cartridge which came in the box seems to be running out quickDoesn't support wifi 5 GHz"
3,"This is sort of a ""fancy"" printer overall, but its performance on printing speed, color print quality etc. are just average. I tried to take a color printout of a picture and it took more than 4 minutes to do so. For black print also it took irritatingly long time. Though this printer looks ""modern"", it's the slowest home-used category printer I ever used.One big gripe(atleast for me) is that a long print-paper cannot be fed inside the sheet-feeder(picture attached) and hence the feeder can't be closed and so can't be printed. This is because of the sheet-feeder design & its size of this particular model  unlike conventional top-loading sheet-feeders of other printers where long print-papers can be kept in the feeder and printed."
1,"Worst product from HP. Even though I managed to print 3-4 pages, the printer failed to initialize right from the moment I switched it on. Even HP engineer visited my place that too AFTER 8 DAYs(lodged complaint on 9th Nov 2020 and he came on 18th Nov 2020) of complaining and gave up on it saying we'll issue a DoI and take the product back."
4,"I had an HP printer in the pre-historic times of deskjets - more than 20 years back & am aware of the ""perils"" of owning one - ink drying up, dusk magnet that eventually clogs up the printer assembly, very high running cost.Anyway, necessitated by the vicissitude of the current time, decided to take a plunge.Was primarily looking for a WiFi printer and found this to be best reviewed and among the most affordable range.Here's the review after using for a month:Goes for it:*Very compact and relatively lightweight*Excellent integration of printer functionality on application that you could install on phone or via PC*As some other user had commented - a ""drawer for paper"" is a good idea*Printer functions on expected lines - nothing stellar but gets the job done - for printing, copying and scanning*Found the scan to print feature helpful for scanning multiple pages - also has a Bulk Scan job feature which I plan to use in futureGoes against it:*Printer set-up esp. the wifi connection bit was clumsy and definitely as per the set-up guide script so users have to be careful*WiFi connectivity is clunky to say the least and the connectivity often goes off*For connecting via USB to a PC, one needs to delete the WiFi Printer set-up first and start over"
4,"After reading the mixed reviews about print quality ,installation and catridge issue, I was a bit skeptical to buy this printer. But after using the printer for a week now, I can say it is the best choice I have made for my needs of home printing. The printer is  very nice, sleek and is light weight. Installation was bit of a struggle as there were no clear instructions and I had to google to figure out the steps after the app is installed on phone. But once it got connected it has been running smoothly. I have used all the functions - printing, scanning and copy and all are working smoothly. I would recommend this printer for people who wants a printer for home i.e for school project/ scanning/ copying few documents. It occupies less place and not very huge as compared to other printers."
1,"I was delivered HP 6075 printer with only one black cartridge installed. The colour was missing. A brand new hp printer does not have cartridge installed, else how will we know if the cartridge inside is genuine not refurbished. Amazon support team is excellent in helping with return. But this kind of experience is bad. Eventually I will be buying offline from one of the malls."
3,Bought this close to 10k rupees. Overall it‚Äôs for home purpose only. Print quality is good.I went to high price just for duplex printing.Con:Scanner is just ok. I say it has bad scanning capability. 300ppi scanning is good. 600ppi takes 40 seconds. For 1200 ppi one must die and take rebirth to see it.Don‚Äôt thing scanning is fast like what we see at xerox shop
4,The printer does the job as in the description. The reason i chose this model was only because of the auto-duplex feature which saves a lot of time and effoet. No problems whats so ever. Had a complication in setting up the printer for wireless access. The connectivity is not consistent. You need to assign a static ip address to the printer for it to work properly. Apart from the wireless connectivity there are no other complaints I've.
5,"This is the ideal printer for home use, I print about 5-10 pages a week. Very easy to setup wirelessly and the functionality of remote printing via mail attachment works flawlessly.With the right print settings, the ink consumption can be minimised and you can stretch the output of number of sheets.Paper tray, wireless connectivity, remote printing, Smart App are just some of the features that are very functional and useful."
5,Package was perfect üëçüèª and very easy to setup. Scan the QR code and all install the app and register. And The rest of the job done by itself.Coping checked ‚úÖ scanning ‚úÖ photo printing ‚úÖ photo coping (xerox)‚úÖ
5,Installation was smooth and didn't take much time to sort things out and make it working. HP smart app is pretty user friendly that way.4.2* from 328k reviews does say the app is good enough to do what is expected out of it.My 5 stars is purely on the value for money it carries with wifi and auto duplex features.
1,It's printing cost is very high.It Cartridge cost approx INR 800/=each (Black & Tri Colour).Company wrote that u can print 480 pages from Black Cartridge and 150 pages from tri colour but it's not true. After 200-250 print app will show u very low on ink.I will not recommend any one to buy this product.
5,Pro'sThe size is very sleekThe light indications for various events and errorsThe paper tray has a yellow light indicating the tray is not closedDuplex printingGood quality photo printsEasy to Print using phoneCon'sThe cost of ink and prints are bit expensive but that a case for any inkjet
1,"I thought the low cost printer, might be equivalent to 4279 printer. But this one very downgraded model. DO NOT BUY and DON'T GOI Feel bad  why brought this mud boxits worst both catridges gone with in 180 pages :( worst .. don't gooooBetter go for INKTANK printers"
4,Good print quality and easy to print.The main disadvantage with the printer is its very hard to install/Setup. Got no installation manual with the printer..and the one available online doesn't help.with the wifi set up. Had to do lot of trial and error methods to make the printer work on wifi.Also no specific set-up videos onYou Tube for this particular model.
1,"Warranty mentioned in description is 1 year but actual warranty is 8 months on HP site. HP will not correct warranty detail even if you provide all detail like invoice copy and GST bill, they will register your case but will not act upon it.About printer: Average print quality but printing cost is too high. After printing 3 pages HP smart app started showing warning to change ink."
2,"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two."
1,Had to return because the product was damaged and had black ink marks
1,It's Very Bakbass Product I Ever Purchased From Amazone. The print Quality is very Pood.  It's had not All colours. Bad Product. Plz donot purchase it. Go for another lazier prienter. I want my money back
5,Received the product in good condition.. Packing was good.. Print quality is also good.. Fully satisfied with product.. Would recommend others to buy Hp products...
5,"Wanted a printer for home and home office use. Max usage of 200-300 pages per month. Delivery on time, setup/installation was simple and without any hitches. Printing smooth, already printed 200 pages with the cartridge supplied along with the printer. Overall satisfied."
4,Please HELP!I need a cover for the printer HP Ink advantage 6750 I just bought from Amazon. I dont see a compatible cover online for this printer model.
1,Never buy inkjet. You will keep buying ink cartridges too often. Buy laserjet or inkfill.
5,"First day usage review:Got early delivery. Thanks to Amazon.Packaging was good and device is very light weight.Configuration and setup was very easy.Tested colour, B/W printing - working fine.Tested photo copying - working fine.Tested scanning - working fine.This works fine with USB cable and WiFi on Windows 10 laptop.Working good from iPhone mobile too.Thanks to HP and Amazon."
3,The cartridge printed only 20 black pages before starting to display that printer is low on inksThis is suprirngly odd as I bought same printer for myself 1 month back - and the Catridge is still running good despite being printed 200 pages.
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
5,"Good Printer which is very easy to install and given by many videos  online. The process is very simple to install and completes in 15 mins. Its perfect for the home printings with kids online classes and work from home prints.Pros :- Excellent print quality - awesome color prints and black and white.- Excellent Wifi connectivity- Awesome ADF - can scan the 40+ pages in one go- super easy ink refill, and no spilling of ink- HP Smart app was easy to set-up and use"
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
1,I BROUGHT HP 530 INKTANK PRINTER ON AMAZON SITE. THE PRINTER PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGNING. SO MANY TIMES COMPALINT RAISE. NO USE. ONE OR TWO TIMES SERVE TECNICIAN CAME AND CHANGE CARTIDGES BUT NO USE . AGAIN AND AGAIN COMPLAINT. NEXT THE TECHNICAIN CAME AND REPLACE PRINTER. BUT FEW DAYS OK AFTER THAT PRINTER PAPER JAM AND PAPER TORN. AND NOW THE PRINTE TOTAL DEAD POWER NOT ON. AGAIN COPMPALINT RAISE. BUT TECNICIAN NOT COME.SO HP SEVERVICES IS SO BAD.It's their job to buy HP products by mistake
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
4,"I have upgraded from a Canon printer and I feel it is worth the money spent.Overall:-  Print quality is very good for normal printing. Documents color and b/w are extremely good on normal quality mode.- Photo print quality is good for personal use. It is comparable to some of the prints I have received from photo-studio. However if you are looking for high quality professional photos, this may not meet your expectation and those printers are quite expensive.- There are review comments about ink not drying on photo paper: To avoid this, you have to set the paper type as ""HP Photo Paper"" or ""Other injet Photo Paper""  depending on you paper while printing. Also ensure to use good quality phot paper.- There are few review comments about paper falling off after printing: Again I have found that the out paper tray has two stop options, if you pull it max, then paper does not fall-off.- 2 sided printing and 2 sided scanning is available, but the paper has to be loaded manually after onside is completed. This option works only from desktop, HP smart app on mobile does not provide this feature.- Online HP support is quite useful. The executive tries to help you over phone and if required can take remote access of your system to provide support.- Noise is not too much. If you still want a silent printer, there is quite mode, but the printing speed will be very slow.Printing Speed: Not as advertised but should be quite okay for personal use.Fist attempt - A4 color copy in normal quality took 1min 10 second. and Normal quality color print on photo paper took 4 minutes.Second attempt after cleaning head and alignment: 30 seconds for A4 size photo print in best quality (photo paper)Wifi connectivity: It is quite easy to setup wifi, however I had some initial glitches where the printer was connecting only to 5Gz and not on 2.4GHz. Connected with HP support, but they could not solve the issue. I reset the printer to factory defaults and after that the problem got sorted out.HP Smart App has good option on desktop, but on mobile it has very limited option for settings. This could have been improved.What I liked most:1. ADF allow me to scan/copy bunch of papers together.2. Printer can connect to both 2.4 & 5Hz network simultaneously3. Wifi-Direct option allows to print direct without connecting to network4. HPePrint option is useful if you want to print document from a remote location."
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
5,I bought this printer for 16200rs at sale with card discount. Printing speed is good.First day I had to print around 250 pages (2 sides).It costed me around 200rs approx If I had got it printed at shop It would have costed me atleast 500rs.Two issues I had noticed so far.1. For 2 side prints we have to print one side for all pages and put it back into feed. During this process I once got mismatch front back print because 1 of the first side print had 2 pages stuck together because of which mismatch happened while printing the second side.2. I have two laptop both running windows 10 out of which one laptop was able to install hp printer drivers easily but the second was not able to download the drivers. Not sure what the issue is.If you are looking for printing duplex(2 side print) in large quantity then I would suggest you to go for printer with proper duplex print where you dont have to manually print the second side.I haven't tried printing from mobile but will update once I do.Hope you find this review helpful.
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
1,Almost using the printer for 6 months and the problems are1.always showing paper size mismatch2.every time it has communication error ...al the print command stored in que and suddenly it prints all of them at once3.Takes lot of time to boot up4.Worst service of HP .....At least booked call for 5 times no body reaches and the complains automatically closed.
1,Prints very slow.Print quality is very bad in both color and b&w.Doesn't maintain proper margins on A4 paper. You have to select Letter for proper prints.Body paint peels off. Brand new printer looks like a three year old badly used printer in a week.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I‚Äôm already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn‚Äôt have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
5,"Value Product. Don't think more, just go for it. Printing is awesome and very easy to install, but you also contact hp care for installation i.e. free.Most important Amazon (Appario Retail Private Ltd) have done a wonderful job in delivering the product."
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
2,At this price segment this printer is waste of money I am totally unsatisfied with its printing and scanning quality. After 3 to 5 pages print I mark that little much ink is flow around the text and also during the scan it's pixel density is very low
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
5,Excellent product however vendor has to be bit carefull while package such crtical device. Packing was not good and high chamces of product damage during delivery. Otherwise delivery was on time.. I am happy with the product

1,"The printer was purchased on 21 July, 2020 but became defective just after 5 days of installation. We could just print about 20 pages on 2 ocassions within a span of 5 days on receipt and installation. On 3rd time on 04 Aug, 2020, it failed to switch ON and gave error message of system initialize problem. HP service engineer visited to repair it and suspects major problem in internal components but the company has refused to replace the printer, as whole.Item not worth purchasing and I feel let down by the brand name of HP.Example of poor customer care/regard by HP."
1,"It's just a wired printer, not working for e print , google clouds print , apple print . Cheating customers by giving wrong description.Don't buy there are so many other options available with low price"
5,"First reviewed a lot on HP laser printer for home use, purchased this and, fully read the manual, enabling wifi or wireless use for printing and scanning is very simple.  Unless and only if manual is followed in order to configure then only everything becomes easy to use.will update later"
1,"The product is ok. But Amazon has provided partial information about the product. Its a manual duplex printer and not an automatic one. And this information is nowhere mentioned in product description, while all the gazillion other details are there. I found out about it only when my 10 day return/replacement policy on the product expired and AMAZON clearly refused to help me with matter. Neither did they owe it up to their mistake of providing partial information. Will NEVER again order anything expensive from Amazon. Customer care is pretty useless."
5,"Best part : manageable size, acceptable print,scan and Xerox. No Hassel of ink drying if not in use like inkjet. Excellent WiFi connectivity using HP smart App. Recommended when you suddenly need prints /scan and Xerox sometime and no use some time.Not an color printer. Laser color printers are not proven at these price."
5,Great product
5,I use it for home purpose. very easy to use. design is subtle and simple. and i am impressed by brilliant packaging by amazon. i received it in very nice shape. only problem is digital screen is small and has no light in background so it is little bit hard to read. still this printer is amazing.
1,Good evening sir. Instead of laser M1005 model I forgot to by this. Kindly change it as soon as possible sir. Very few days only I used this printer. Kindly take bake and change Lacer M1005 model sir. This is my humble request sie
5,Very easy to install. Has great print quality.Scan quality is also not bad. You just need HP account and an app then you're good to go from any device. Just keep in mind you remove all the packaging even inside the printer next to cartridge. It is plastic n can melt if not removed.
5,"USB & WiFi Direct is working excellent.But when we connect laptop give print, error message will display (use USB). After reinstall of software working fine, but everytime can't do the same. Once switch off & on it will appearing but not able connect laptop with the same WiFi network."
1,waste of money always showing low tonner even after filled also
1,"Sad to write neither Amazon nor HP does bother to help in giving a demo on how to connect and use.Thanks to COVID restrictions , HP is enjoying on poor service."
5,A versatile laser printer at an attractive price point for those who have low to medium printing volumes
5,The product meets the quality and specification of a branded item. Very happy
5,"The Wireless facility and Mobile printing is very useful. Easy to print anything in your mobile like whatsapp documents, photos etc..etc..using HP mobile app. Scanner and copier also useful to reduce our stress"
1,Product is too bad and after purchase their service is too bad
4,Good product for printing and also scanning. nice product but I received only few days . You can also not buy this product.
5,Good Printer... Let's wait to see it's cartridge printing and refilling cost and other maintenance...
1,HP has one of the worst Customer Support. Instead of sending somebody and resolving the issue they have wasted previous Business hours.
4,this printer is amazing easy to used .printing speed os pretty good and sharp print details üëç
1,Hp not any support .. very bad quality printer don't buy hp any product .
3,Printer sims to be good but not that is showing the image.Also not known why the warranty is only for 7 months ?? Please revert on this point ??
4,Overall good no doubt
5,Have had a positive experience with the product. It's quick and neat!
4,Colour print is not availableImprovement needs with apple devicesToner replacement cost is high
3,"Product is ok, but HP support is pathetic, you have to approach several times to get the work done. Not expected this from HP"
2,Toner cartridge dry and not working. So no question of rating a printer. Please supply a functional one immediately.
5,Use very easy
4,Printer cost would have been a little low
5,Nice
5,Great product with indeed a impressive performance.
1,only 300 paper prinoutwifi connectivity is very poor
5,Great

5,"HP printer works efficietly, it is value for money."
1,Local tonner in the printer. Never buy online.
3,Two side print experience is very bad
1,Beware. This printer has no scanning & photo copy facility. It's not compatible with Apple operating system
5,"Received in very good condition, package Box doesn't  have any dent or scratches, printer, cartridge, usb cable, power cord and driver cd all original and sealed condition under the Canon card Box, all items working smoothly without any issues and till running... high quality cost effective printing by Canon... Just go for it"
4,The Installation driver CD received with the printer in the box was physically damaged/ broken. so I had to download the driver from the printer company's website to setup the printer on my laptop.
1,"Worst experience, it doesn't support even manual duplexing, which is available in all brands selling same feature printer at this priceIt just requires a software upgrade.But company officials denied just by saying that we cannot provide it.In the era where everyone is trying to save paper, Canon still thinks that printing on both sides is not that important.They want us to sweat if you want to print on both sides of the page.Really a deal-breaker for me, but sadly I purchased it, and now I'm stuck with this printer.Go for HP 1020 Plus, it is much better option at the same prince range"
1,"First of all, I want to confirm that, this is not imageCLASS printer it's Laser Shot printer, the seller has mentioned the wrong information on the Amazon. I don't know why Amazon allow the seller to publish their product with the wrong information.Second thing, print quality is damn lighter and image printing is the pixelating event not clear as is should be with a laser printer, I'm using another laser printer which is much cheaper & print quality is damn awesome.I consulted with my IT person he briefed me that, the toner which I've received with this printer either not original one or a copy of this toner, as my printing is very lighter, whether it should be sharpest and darkest with the original toner.I must recommend you to purchase any printer locally instead of online. because if you persist any issue you may contact your local seller and can get the instant support for this. I know, It may be a little bit costly in comparison to online but you'll get instant support."
5,Superb... I‚Äôm using it for the past 6 years .. simply the best for bulk use ... 30 prints per day for 6 years .. just replacing toner cartridge or filling .. drum and other service done one or two time ....I‚Äôm now having three lap2900b printers ....I suggest to buy this one ... no brand or model match this one ... too good
5,Pros. 1.best print quality n low turn on time2. Easy n quick cartridge replacement3. Easily available refilling service; thanks to model's popularity4. High re-sell valueCons. 1. 10-13 ppm. Low ppm for bulk print.Overall good investment for small business.
5,"This review is after 2 years of purchase. I bought this out of my first hand experience in my institution. Still smooth, nice, no single printing has gone wrong. It is all about care and maintanence. Don't keep nearby windows and expose to broad sunlight. I am happy so far."
1,First the packing is not good. It is cello taped. The cable donot have a cover.  More over the in stallion is chargeable at 590 rs. Will be intimated after you raise a ticket through canon support
5,Good printer writing a review after after 2 weeks of purchase. It's good for less frequent user as inkjet printers lure you through low pricing but puts holes to your pockets in maintenance if not used daily whereas on the other hand laserjet printers are little expensive but are worth.
5,Price worth for this product. Good Model past 10yrs.
1,the above printer is not at all compatible with Mac . Amazon didn't specify it. its a pity there is no return policy only a replacement one. Amazon should at least give an option  for the buyer to upgrade the printer in case it does not fit the requirement. For this product replacement does not help !.
4,The most efficient laser printer if you don't want copy and scan option. The. Cost of this printer going up from 9000 to 15000 talks about the demand this printer has in the market among buyers
5,"I have used an earlier version of this same printer model and now this new version. Its a no-frills-attached printer, but is excellent in doing its basic job of printing. And it lasts. Durable."
4,"Well, today I received the product with fantabulous package. More than the product, I fell in love with the package.  I received the printer and CD in a very good condition even without a little scratch. Delivery is as expected within the deadline. Btw, after using the product, I'll post review on the product in detail. As for now , am very happy with the quality of product I received.  Thanks Amazon."
5,I have worked with this printer from 5years in my office with out any trouble. Now I have purchased the same  for myself.  Very useful in business or official works.
5,Zero worry installation. Product as expected Sturdy and built for the long term. Quick boot and print ready. Can print from mobile as well with USB converter and appropriate app
4,its is simple and small in size. so easy to carry and refill. it is  cheap in refilling 250 to 300 rs and every where we can get refill option even in small towns. each refill you can get 600 to 800 prints.
5,"Functions smoothly, no unnecessary appendages or confusion. Smart and efficient."
5,I am using it from more then a 1.5 years now its works awsome never had any problems with it go for it amazing product
1,Needed to return this product cause it is completely useless. Canon's staff didn't help one bit. I'm going to sell it off on OLX if anyone wants it.
5,It took 3 hours to install it on macbook air running big sur..Finally found patch for it in apple discussion forum..Best quality leser printer.. loved it..
5,"I've owned this printer for 4 months now. No issues. Easy setup, even easier to print."
5,Product is very good I'm so very happy with amazon delivery before given time.
5,I ordered this printer about one month ago and i had printed many papers. This printer is very useful for home purposes. I am satisfied.
2,Print Quality is too poorlining comes left side on the top
5,Yes I like it but double side printing is quite tough and the driver doesn't have  double sided printing option which many others have.
5,"Excellent team support of amazon. Even though I received broken CD of drivers, amazon team supported me great. Thankvu so much. Printer is working excellent"
5,"This canon lbp 2900b is awesome printer, this is my second printer i am using this printer past 12 year awesome print quality, less maintenance"
5,Good to possess for home  & small offices
4,"Great printer with USB connectivity. Even able to send prints via mobile too... Value for money... Yes, print speed is little low but is well..."
5,Thanks for the item and packing are good
2,Paper jammed in every 3-4 paper printing.Cartridge get  ill- responsive only after printing 700-800 pages.
3,Price is too much in amazon.in..please check the local market but the quality of the printer is very good.
4,Value for money
4,"Product is all good, but I do need tax invoice of my business purchase to claim ITC , please let me know how to get my tax invoice, have not got same with the product."
5,"I didn't get the warranty card , otherwise the product is nice. How will I get warranty card?"
5,Good delivery.. I brought that on Nov2019 still now there is no issues.. Easy to use and shift..
5,"This is the best laser printer in the market. And price is also very affordable. Thank you Canon, Amazon and the Seller."
1,"After 2 days of installation, the printer stopped functioning out of nowhere. Worst experience ever. I wish if there could be a technician from company to help me with it."
5,Really easy to use. Easily install to the pc. Print quality is so clear.

1,"Oct 24, 2019: Printer seems like a waste of money.Tri-Colour print head seems to have failed in a new device purchased in Mar 2019. No way of emailing HP product support. One of the ways I seemed to have done it from HP site (from my login there) never got me a response!=======The printer works extremely well & silently except for the following (note: All my devices are either MacOS or IOS):1. This printer was purchased from Amazon in March 2019, the warranty for the product (as per HP site) had started in December 2018!2. It does not switch off automatically in 2 hours - as per printer web-page this feature is pre-setup & cannot be altered3. No instructions on how to make the Manual Duplex feature work from a Print option (at least on MacOS)4. Knowledgeable/ trouble shooting guides have no information on this5. Due to Ink-Tank feature, it is not easy to just ""pick-up"" the printer & carry it - it has to be kept horizontal to avoid ink spills, so carrying to an HP service centre is out of question.6. The Chat Bot on HP website cannot answer anything that you cannot read in a manual - it is totally useless & does not even recognise that it should redirect the person to a human.7. All support information is for Windows devices - not help for Mac OS is available8. Still trying to figure out how to talk to a support representative as they are available only during my working hours or shorter & I have not been able to find an option to leave a message/ email for help.In short - very good product when it works, but support seems to suck. Also, some problem of seller (assuming warranty start date is their issue), published features (switching off - everybody is now lazy to switch off a shared printer/ Manual duplex) do not always work."
1,First of all it's not worthy for the money you pay!! The color prints smurge. The plug is not stable to put in the socket . To print off it asks to install plug-in besides HP smart app.it will take time to print . sometimes it doesn't print at all and the paper comes empty . I just got fooled by the good reviews . Even after the ink dries up it smurge .waste of money
5,Excellent product.  Bought it during Diwali offer...
5,"My Views:LIKE:Faster print than earlier inkjet HP printer, wireless connection is easy to configure.Print quality is good with the speed of Print.Resolution of scan is acceptable.HP smart Print or scan feature is icing on cake.Very good facility of Scan n share with mobile HP smart app.Same day of receipt from Amazon, HP Engineer did Installation ..Great work.Spare Ink bottle would be sufficient for atleast 1.5 years for my printing need.Packing condition of Printer was safe enough..DISLIKE:Manual Duplex: need to feed the paperNot sturdy built quality but ok. Need to keep it safe.Protusion out of Ink tanks from main body of Printer.Conclusion: Recommend to buy"
5,"So,let me give you  true review. Packing by Amazon was awsome. Let me directly tell you about best , best , best feature about this printer 1) wi-fi direct, you can directly take prints wirelesly using smartphone , pc , laptops. No need to use datacable, pen drive etc , this device is completly wire free.Another most most amazing feature is, you can even scan docoments using smartphone, laptop ,pc. Scaned copy will directly be sent to your device wirelesly. Print quality is awsome, and fast."
4,"I am writing a review for HP 419 AIO printer. Package arrived early, installation was quite easy, did it myself.‚Ä¢ Wireless connectivity works well‚Ä¢ It's not that heavy, comes with 2 black bottles and 3 bottles (cyan, magenta, yellow), they were spill resistant, didn't cause a mess‚Ä¢ Got printheads, easy to installOnto print quality‚Ä¢ It's great for text‚Ä¢ Photo prints are alright, if you only want to print photos, I recommend not going for it unless you use high GSM paper‚Ä¢ Scanning & copying is great, works pretty wellOne thing though when it printed out the guide, it said HP 410 printer, so if you want to spend lesser money, go for 410, it's literally the same except for having an extra black bottle that you can purchase for less than the extra amount I had to pay for 419Overall, it's nice. Go for it."
5,"HP printer is very good product.  But the HP dealer/service centre of Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands is not supported for service.  They are shown the HP company letter that if HP printer purchased from online is not covered warranty.  I was purchased HP printer 410 which is warranty period is upto 28 December 2019.  But they are not accepted the warranty and charged for Rs 3000/- (Rupees three thousand only).  So it is my advice to customer don't purchase HP printer.  The warranty period showed the online is making fool to customer.  PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE HP PRINTER"
1,"Lot of instructions and still difficult to install. When I called their helpline, the agent told me I am not supposed to install by myself!!!! Like, how is anybody supposed to know. Once you open the packaging all it says in big font is instructions of how to install. The printer head gets stuck when you connect to power. But why???  And amazon pickup guy canceled thrice. But why???  Overall not a great experience."

1,"Used printer with empty ink bottles and two empty packets of system printhead sent in the box by Appario retail pvt ltd.. The actual parts were missing. There was ink leakage everywhere. Amazon said to wait for HP technician to open the box, we registered nobody came from HP and Amazon is not ready to change the printer though we are a prime customer... AMAZON SUCKS... SO DOES HP..."
5,"After using this printer for a long duration, I'm writing this review.1. Sometimes the paper print was not coming out completely, only half portion is getting printed2. When printing some bulk pages say 10 pages, printing was getting stuck in between and getting hanged up. We need to cancel the job and print the papers one by one3. Color and Black and white print quality was excellent when we select the properties of the printer of the print quality as High before giving a print out"
1,"I purchase this printer for my father office, but since it arrived its not working properly. I setup my father office after 10 days printer arrived so return window closed.So I contact hp support but from there also 2 times enginner comes but nothing works.I got defective product from seller himself so I Would say purchase from offline , you can check other reviews mostly all negative I make mistake so be carefull.whenever I print all pages stuck in printer. I wasted my 13000 Rs Wanted to sell at 5000 also if someone ready. so much tired from this garbage."
1,"It has lots of disadvantages1. Printing speed is very slow, it will take approx. 5MINS to print 10papers2. You can't continuously print 50 or more papers, as it will either show error or stop and start from beginning in-between.3. Printing on both the sides is good on single paper, but if u do on 10 papers it will forget the numbers in-between and start from beginning.4. Photo print is not good on normal A4 paper. Didn't try on photo paper.Advantages1. Scanning and xerox is good2. Easy to set up, but watch video on YouTube if you wanna do yourself. You will also get support from hp.3. Debugging on wireless setup is also good. Provided on hp website.Overall this is over priced and not good printer."
5,Great product and the printing speed is much better than Epson tank printers
1,The printer turned out to be one of the worst products I have purchased from Amazon. It does not connect with the laptop leaving no choice but to download everything on mobile and then print. Further it only prints pdf and does not support other document types.The printer does not support double side printing. The cartridge leaked and now it gets stuck in every print.On top of it HP offers the worst support mostly through bots that are good for nothing.Yours sincerelyA disappointed customer
5,"I got this printer yesterday and it is working as expected. Do not see any issues until now.Also, got two Black Ink bottle along with colors bottle. And black Ink bottles are of 170 ml while the ink tank capacity of the printer is 80 ml. So even after filling the ink tank, I have half of the ink left in the opened bottle and another unopened bottle. So definitely I can do a lot of printing before I need to buy ink bottles."
5,I bought because my sister using it for 1 year and is showing excellent prints and no doubt you can buy it .... and installation done by myself using YouTube videos as I don‚Äôt want to invite an anonimous person from ho for free installation and the installation for this very easy .. just followed the YouTube videos .. and it‚Äôs been working good ... don‚Äôt follow the low reviews just buy it ... and you yourself can install it not a big problem at all ..
4,Overall good only for home use . Inks used are cheaper compared to toner. Easy to install and just need to be carful first time while installing header. The biggest draw back is its take more time to print the colour. secondly be careful to give number of copies while shifting between colour or black/white. Rest good if you can bear with your time.
5,"I am more than satisfied with the product. once installed with guidance mentioned in the user manual, it's all easy to take printouts, when ever you need that, either from your PC or mobile.Now my 7 year kid to find it straight forward to get a print for his school projects."
5,I ordered this printer after tatacliq couldn't deliver after a month . This came within a week of ordering. It's easy to install. You can either refer to the manual provided or you can see installation videos from youtube. Took an hour to install. It's easy to use. Print quality is good. It's WiFi enabled also.
5,"The feedback is after using for 2 weeks. Very good product, easy to install in all the devices, be it laptop or desktop or mobile. The User interface (UI) of the app as well as HP smart is smooth. However, it time lags a few seconds in the mobile app. Print quality, scan quality is equally good. Now the number of pages printed has to be checked to arrive at the per page cost as claimed."
4,"The printer is quite good with relatively fast printing speed and better print quality. It's easy to install if you follow the manual thorougly or watch some YouTube videos and once connected to PC/Mobile app, easy to use too. However, I don't like the fact that the ink storage tank is protuding out of the main body which makes is vulnerable to impacts and, HP's policy about the phone app is absolutely nonsensical I don't see a reason why I need to sign-in with my email in order to print my private documents via my private printer in my own domicile."
5,"Print quality is amazing , a durable product and installation is also easy"
1,This has to be the dumbest piece of machine I have every come across. I have been struggling with this even after weeks of purchasing it. Even I connect the USB cable the HP smart app cannot find the printer. Connecting with wifi worked fine for the first few days. Now it takes many minutes for the printer to come online after I switch it on. Real waste of money!
1,"Printing takes a lot of time. If we insert more papers in the tray it will not print smoothly or the papers not going orderly and getting jam. The worst thing is the photo print quality. I used best quality photo papers, and the prints getting with a light scratch mark. Very disappointed to buy this at this high cost. Better to have a low cost printer. If we try to contact customer service there is only a virtual agent and it can't get our actual issues and can't help us. Very poor service."
1,"Totally harassed to operate the printer, wifi not working properly, both side printing not performing, paper cost raised caused to interrupted printing and damage of papers. searching alternative. very unfortunate. HP make me offended by through this printer."
5,"Printing is so smooth and easy.Color prints (kids school project) were good enough. I haven't tried to take photo printouts yet . Many have complained about paper Jams , let's hope it doesn't happen :).  So far I am loving it for the economical prints and the ease of refilling ink in the ink tanks. I would recommend this printer to others."
5,"I have been using this printer for couple of months now.Installation steps are very easy except pouring the ink that takes time and setting up the cartridges that must be fit in exact slot.Using the printer with laptop, smartphone is extremely easy and it hardly takes a minute to get started.I have tried printing office papers, kid's school cards on 230 paper and works like a charm"
5,"Printer is very good. Quality of printing is very good. If it is black and white print out time is as fast as a laser printer. If color printer, it takes time (less than a minute anyway...)Installing print heads is tough. The manual is not enough to do installation. I watched in youtube to get better understanding of installation.Ink bottles are costly. (you will get 1 set free anyway..) And printer seems to use more ink ...inks are getting vanished faster..!HP smart is very easy to use and great way to use. WiFi options is too good.Overall...go for it...very very good printer in budget."
2,It is 4 days from delivery and HP engineer is not turned up for installation. Service number is 166244.  Need urgent support to get this installed . Then only quality will be rated.
2,"Well...bought this printer as a mistake and totally regret the decision. Print quality is trash duplex printing doesn't work at all and really slow. Overall just a really really bad printer. Please go for Epson or cannon, trust me this has been a waste of 15k rsCustomer service is also bad they take min 30mins to respond and iam not able to get product support for this issue.Really disappointed with hp for this one"
1,This is the most worst product I have seen ever..
5,"Its been more than 8 months after i purchased this printer. I am writing this review after using it. If you are planning to buy a printer that would provide cost effective copies, and a wireless connectivity this is the best choice. This is not recommended for people who use printers ver rarely. This printer should be used atleast once in a week ro avoid issues. The print quality is 90/100 and value for money is 95/100. The number of copies per cartridge (yield) is same as its mentioned product description."
5,Only issue is a print sent to HP Email address. Takes like about 5 minuted for a full page. Very slow. Anything connected on the network or directly with a calble is very good and fast.Dint try printing photos yet... shall try ot soon and update the revire. For now.. i dont see a reason to remove a star off.
1,"Pathetic... I have Neven seen or used such rubbish item in my entire life. This printer does not work properly. You will give some other command it will some other. It is worst while printing on both sides..you please even don't expect from this printer. It does not connect to your gadgets easily, you will have to pull your hair out here. Hundres of my pages go in vain because it does not work properly."
4,"You will have to watch youtube videos to install it perfectly by yourself. But once successfully installed it is a good buy. To register you have to search product no which is inside of front cover lid. Must register the product. While print quality is good , there is no duplex printing, no duplex ID scan (available in bro printer) and no paper tray, which is a drawback."
5,This inktank hp 419 printer is good enough for home use and office use as well. It has a fault when you print many pages such as 20-30 at a time it takes a time gap after printing 10-12pages and automatically print the remaining.  Otherwise this printer is low cost both black and color print.
2,We ordered the printer and it was delivered properly. Installation was done by us as no one from HP called for scheduling installation. The network feature does not work. There is no installation guide on how to use it with HP App or how to set up on office wifi networkPrint quality is OK. Must use regularly else ink chokes the printer nozzle.
2,"Document printing is up to mark.but don't expect pro level photos prints. The biggest issue with this printer is setting up wireless printing (hp 419) .I tried everything I could to set-up wireless printing but failed. I called the customer care and they tried to remote assist and set up the same and they failed. Then they literally said that I have to use USB printing as they are not able to set up wireless printing.So , DON'T BUY THIS WIRELESS SERIES HP PRINTER.  Opt for usb printing or if you really need wireless printing then go for other brands.Such a disappointing experience."
1,"Please do not buy this because  installation local team is very poor,After so many follow up they just came start and go away.I can't able to print and i called them they blocked me."
4,"The printer was easy to install including the wireless settings and I was able to print over Wi-Fi. The catridge life was showing as 10% on the new printer which didn't sound right. So ordered another one (Thanks to Amazon Return policy) which got delivered and old one was picked. Installed all over again and went straight to check the catridge life and it shows 100% now. So make sure you check the catridge life and get it replacedpromptly. Other than that one issue, it seems to be working fine. Have tried both printing and copying. Quality is good."
5,Wish I could have purchased it earlier - I already purchased 4 deskjets/inkjets from last 10 yrs - but I don't know why they eat so much ink - I got tired of ordering its cateridges - Also my kids are in school (11yrs & 6 yrs) and they get something to get print out every second day and during exams - you can understand. This serves my black and white printouts (almost 90% of requirement) and I have HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4335) that serves colored printout (10% of requirement). the print quality and speed is great ! and energy save option is also cool - it remains on standby and whenever you need a printout from your phone or laptop - just give a command and in less than 30 secs you will have your printout :) Amazing. Hassle free. Very satisfied with the product and its features
3,Canon is not giving installation n demo serviceIt takes charges for demo n installationThat's not fair
5,"The product was delivered before time. Excellent printing and quality of the scanner is also pretty good. The machine is the latest in its class and wireless connectivity, printing from smart phone features are superb. All-in-one unit Canon i-SENSYS MF 232w is ideal machine for home. amazon.in has wide variety of products and fully satisfied with their services.Rajendra Joshi17/05/2017"
1,"This was my worst decission to buy a printer from amazon. The product which i received from amazon was a defective one. The box was wet and damaged also the print quality was not as expected so i requested a replace. The replaced product which i received was a 2nd hand product. No seal, broken plastic, used cartridges, all transparent papers removed, no driver cd, no user manual. Be cautious while getting this product as amazon has now started delivering used product."
5,I'm stisfied this has WiFi & usb interface. We can scan and print from mobile phone. No need to switch  on the computer. We can print direct via wi fi without a router connection.
1,There is no two sided printing it's major drawbackFor only office purpose not for commercial purposes
4,"Excellent quality output, i was looking all in one printer for small business with ethernet setup and this suits it. But still i see manufacturing date was 2019 and looks like old stock. Also the cartridge comes inbuilt has only 20% so you have to purchase additional cartridge. Overall product is good hope after sales service also good."
3,"Printer is good, however, getting its toner cartridge is a challenge. Canon website also not been of any help. I didn‚Äôt find their website providing option for purchasing original cartridges. Looks like this printer has to be scrapped due to non availability of original cartridges. Suggest avoid any Canon printers in India. Thanks"
5,I got this printer on 25 th August morning.  I called Canon service Center and requested for sending a person for installation.  They registered my request and on same day I got it installed from Service Center. There were no charges for installation.  Very professional service personnel.  Would recommend everyone to download Canon app register the product and call for service help.First day my rating is 5 star.
5,Decent printer with superb features like wifi features.....makes it's more convenient to be use it while placing it in any corner of room/house.Also one more thing first one have some issues Amazon as well as seller simply replace it and suggest replacement by their own means not unnecessary bothering me...So it's superb deal for me....10/10Printing quality is acceptable....Also many other features like printer screen advised every time if printing matter is outnof paper range...Printer-cum-Scanner also it's  upside...So it's highly recommended.....Canon's machine.....
5,Very good product from canon.This is not Chinese product. This made by south koria. And Japan based Company. It's Good think.Toner used 337.
4,Canon should send its person to install the new printer and sync it with our existing network systems.We had to unnecessarily pay extra Rs.1500.00 to our maintenance person.The cartridge given with printer had very short life of few days of normal printing of about 10-15 pages/day.
5,"Mass productIt does not support duplex printing.It is faster when we connect to ur computer or mobile wired or wireless.And we can make certain paper setting in the printer itself instead of doing it in ms word.There is a difficulty to setup a CD drive in computer,if u look and read the guide properly you will be able to setup .Thatsall"
1,"Print quality is horrible and the CANON customer service is poor. Raised a dispute one week before and still waiting for the response. Attached a print quality comparison for better understanding. Right side is printed using HP P1108 and left side is printed using Canon MF232w. While registering the complaint, I mentioned the quality difference. That time the customer service executive told that do not compare the print quality with other printers. I don't understand how could he say that while the output from Canon MF232w is not understandable."
1,Item is faulty and fake cartridge inside. The printer shows a counterfeit cartridge message and doesn't print a single page. Very disappointed with Amazon. Expected better.
4,It‚Äôs easy to set up and start using.  Print quality  and speed is as expected.  Spend some time exploring it properly.If the colour printer was cheaper I‚Äôd have bought it.
5,"I was little confused before I order this printer. There's so many options available claiming to be best but I chose to buy this printer. Entirely satisfied. It's fast, print quality is brilliant, cost of printing is low. Anyone without 0 technical knowledge can install it."

4,good printer only issue is that it is not auto duplex printer . no slot for pen drive for scanning. as scanning can be done trough computer only
5,I took this printer and superb and nice features. Before buying this I had tried other printer very tough to install for both Mac and Windows 10. But this CANON Printer is superb easy to install for both Mac and Win
1,My  product is not operte in first timeSome technical issuesPlease solve this in urgency
5,"Very easy for use.Nice lookVery very good productWifi connection , scan, Xerox , very fast .Thank you Amazon..."
5,Copy is late and double paper insert
1,Print quality is very poor I raised the complaint & engineer gives me illogical reasoning saying being high speed printer my not print clear. I am really annoyed & want to return it!
5,This Covd19 times with children and work this printer is very handy. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
5,Good quality print .No delay in printing.Easy to use. Quality product. Timely delivery .
5,"I am using Canon for last many year and happy with Canon. This time I ordered WiFi model, but it is not working, may be I did not configure it properly, so I will contact canon customer support for this, hope it will be resolved on call only."
3,Every functionality (print/scan) works but quality isn't matching the brand name of Canon.
3,Expected a lot from a cannon but this printer seems to be very lame and not worth the money they are charging
3,In this model duplex print command not working properly in manually print. This is not a duplex printer. But manually duplex not working also.
5,Go for it! Both printing and scanning is good. Easy to print from phone. No need to talk about quality as it is a Canon's product.
4,"There is no dilike point noticed by me .Smooth running & paper printing quality good .After all ,I like this model."
4,"No duplex prinitingWifi setup is cumbersome.Rest all is good , print quality , print speed , low noise level and usb based setup is easy.Good product for home use."

5,"Excelent Printer from Canon fast delivery, easy to use good print quality"
2,Only 500 prints and ink level has reached half.Fake promising of 5k prints
1,Fast time hp said that no of print 5000But actually it's print 1000 so costing is high.
2,You are really chiting campany in hp printers 5k no printer500 page in one toner very badAnd very cast one page
1,"It worked fine for around 2 months. After it has printed around 500 pages, the toner level showed half and the prints started coming out very faded. I thought perhaps we should refill the toner. So I bought the genuine toner refill from HP website  and refilled the toner. Instantly the ink level showed 100%. But the print quality remained the same.I called HP support and after 45 minutes of call, the engineer said that the print head seems to be a problem and an engineer will visit me.I waited for 8 days, no one showed up. I called HP support again, they said contact TVS Electronics in Jayanagar, Bangalore. I tried calling them at least 200 times.. on various of their phone numbers listed on HP website and google. No use.I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!I wasted 20K on this printer, just because I trusted the HP brand. Another printer service centre ( who doesnt service HP Neverstop ) told me that this is a bad printer .. most people have print quality issues with this printer."
1,"Printer is not giving 5k print. Don't buy this. Nearly 500 pages comes out which add cost of ink too much in later stage. I believed in Hp promise but its fake. Within 1 month , i have filled 4 times. 500 pages per 1 fill.. Don't buy this."
1,"False claim of 5k prints,but in reality only 300-500 prints.Toner is also very expensive."
5,"Looks like a cute mini photo state machine.Need Windows 10 minimum for Desktop Computer. You must have a router and a Wi-Fi dongle in USB of Desktop. If you have Router then It is good else Windows 10 can start Hot spot with wifi dongle. You can buy dongle from near mobile store or from Amazon. An active internet Connection is compulsary to install setup files. Little bit network technical knowledge is needed.Just type web url for desktop and scan QR code from mobile camera. Link and QR code are printed with books received with the box.This printer can work as photocopier, scanner and printer. Only black and white.Extra cartridge not found but one cartridge within printer with full ink found.Value for money."
2,false promises of 5000 pages only 2500 pages print.this printer is good in quality and system but company claims first purchase 5000 page print. But printer print 2500 pages.
1,I purchased HP Neverstop laser jet MFP Printer - which NEVER WORKSand there is the POOREST SERVICEIf HP wants - I can donate it to them free - Its unused - they can fool someone else tooShekhar Patil -70 year old - have lots of experience with printers in my life9820212303
5,"I have been using the product since month.It is genuine, brand new and good quality printing.Very simple to start with wireless access in this price range which is very accomodaing."
5,Nice product üëåüëç
1,Horrible...... only one page is print and need to restart for printing every page...
5,Best multi purpose scanner printer.I am using hp printers for 20 years now.Now hp is in less plastic movement so this printer do not need to change whole cartridge. I can just refill it. Original refill pack is so much affordable now.I bought this printer for my office last year. And now bought it again for my second branch office.
2,this printer is good in quality and system but some ink problem one tonner can't print 800pages
1,Ink refil pump missing and CD driver
1,"This is very worst product from the manufacturer of H.P.  I never seen this type of bad functionality.  From day 1 it created problem.  Print quality and functionality is worst.  I request every customer not to chose this product.  All expectations were collapsed.  Seller not accepted to return back even requested immediately after purchase.  HP Company never provided any technical service.  I lost Rs.18,000/- for purchase of this printer.  Print quality is too much bad.  Seller advised to contact HP customer care, but Company of H.P. never responded to provide customer service.  This is very very very very bad and worst product of HP.  My rating is 0 star to this product"
4,"Taking print-out from android phone was flawless and very convinient. Establishment of wifi connection between phone and printer is very smooth. No specific app is required for printing from android phone. I have used Samsung J7 & Samsung A7 for this.But it was very difficult for me to install HP software in my Lenovo laptop having OS Windows 7 ultimate-64 bit via USB cable. Not a single software downloaded from official HP site viz Install Easy, Full Web Version, Version for- IT person only was successful. Later it was automatically installed by Windows update. No customer care mentioned in the documents are correct. I have received no call from HP regarding the setup/ installation of the item."
3,"This printer arrived with a leaky drum. What's more, the page count seems to be 24 more than actual (either zero not set correctly or used before shipping). The drum eventually got replaced through HP customer service, but getting through to HP and getting decent help online was a frustrating experience. So well over a month after purchase (of which the delay from my end was about 10 days) the printer is now set up and functional. And satisfactory so far. The ID printing option is convenient.Two disadvantages:1 The paper tray cover is very difficult to put in place and is really really irritating2 it does not print legal size (contrary to what the HP customer service told me on the phone). There is a range given for paper size but essentially you will be using only A4."
1,"I DONT LIKE THIS PRINTER SCANNER, THE PRINTER IS GOOD BUT SCAN QUALITY IS VERY POOR. AND IMAGES ARE CROPPING IN ONE SIDE. MEAN FULL IMAGE IS NOT SCANNING. I AM GOING TO BACK THIS PRODUCT."
5,"Good printer. Works well out of the box. I had some issue with wifi as my router didn't have a wps button. I was able to setup wifi printing by connecting to the printer using usb. Prints are good. If you don't need color, this is certainly a great printer. Able to print well using phone and windows laptop."
3,"Pros:PrintingSeamless setupCheaper refill costCons :It‚Äôs missing Ethernet ,Lacks auto duplex printing (not claimed, but still saying to clear if someone have doubt),comparatively weak WiFiPoor picture printing (might be due to wrong type...but not that great )Google cloud printing support is going away in Dec 2020"
2,"I don't have issue with the product only that I think I received a used product, as I'm trying to register for warranty but it's says already registered 4months  back ago. And the toner indicator shows already half have been used."
4,Very safely amazon delivered the product to my home... relieved my apprehension.
5,"If you are buying this with cloud print in mind google is removing its support for google cloud print for windows after December 31, 2020. Check google cloud print for an alternate solution. If u have apple products you can use air print with this.Other than this if you want to print directly with wifi direct it works flawlessly."
5,"It is almost an year now since I purchased. For people looking for black and white prints with reasonable good quality and affordable price, this is the printer I recommend."
1,"I am sorry to say that I am unable to use to this product due to there is no driver in the packet. As per written life-let I have to download it from Hp support, the website provided by HP for solution and supporting. I have tried so many time but even fruitless I am at the present. I need help to set up this printer in my desktop to use it.Thanking you."
5,"I HAVE SMALL BUSINESS, AND I FACED DIFFICULTIES TO CHOOSE A PRINTER BUT FINALLY I GOT GOOD ONE.. THANKS OTHER REVIEWER AND SELLER DESCRIPTION ..."
3,After refilling with original HP toner the printout is not good at all once it is refilled.
4,"It was said that back to back printing possible,but only manual possible.Anyway it is possible to print back to back.Black cartridge is not available in the HP store"
1,Printer is not good and so customer support.I complaint about bad printing 4 lines are printing at horizontal layout . Not solved until now
1,"The product has decent print quality, but as with every HP product in the market, refills of toner and cartridge are not available. Please buy printers where you can get a refill easily."
3,I am writhing this review after using it a month. I purchased it for Rs. 8999.Pros:-1. Fast printing2. DuplexCons1. High printing cost2. 1 cartridge yield maximum 1500 pages only3. MonochroSince if you want very fast printing and duplex then go with it. But cost for this you have to pay approximately Rs 2.5 per page.And if time is not your concern then go with epson printer in the same price segment you will get all in one printer (print+copy+scan) and page yield is about 7000 page for colour and 6000 page of black. And even one refill cost around Rs.400.I am using both printer thats why I am able to compare both.
1,"I received this printer on 14 July 2019. After installing as guided i connected the printer it got switched on and immediately the fuse gone and trip off in main board. I called the amazon customer care. He advised to change the switch board. When changed it switched on again. Whenever the printer is plugged to switch, the main board gets trip off. Since the power connections are good and is three phase it is getting trip, otherwise there would have been electrical fire which is life threatening to family members. I called the amazon technical team again on 22 July 2019 and spoke to Mr.Vidhya (which is recorded by me). After putting me on hold for four times and extended the call for 30 minutes, he said he has applied for replacement and i will get the message shortly. Even after 24 hours I have not received any message. Today (23 July 2019) when I called for three times I am not at all connected to technical person. May be instead of applying replacement my number would be blacklisted. Once the product is received by us i don't think we will get a replacement. Is there anyone who got their electronic item replaced by Amazon. Please think twice before buying this product through online. Now the replacement date is also gone."
5,"I got this one at ‚Çπ 6850 , which was great in worth for these type of printer ..."
5,"Since last several years I had been suffering a color printer. And since I don't use much, the color cartridges used to stale. All color printers have 4 cartridges and in old color printer, if one cartridge goes faulty, the printer stops. This is crazy. Besides, one color cartridge costs approx Rs. 1500. Multiply this by 4 and its Rs. 6000, just for the cartridges alone. And I never used color cartridge much. but I had to buy it because without it, the Black cartridge won't work. It was an expensive affair.Then I finally decided that enough is enough. I need a printer which is for home use, minimal use, and the cartridge should survive some long period of hibernation. And since I had burned my fingers with an expensive, famous, high end printer, I was looking for a printer with a reasonable budget, preferably below Rs. 10,000.The Brother printer is truly doing good. No hassles. And no paper jams as yet. It's very easy to install. There are youtube videos on how to assemble it. I could do it in less than 5 mins. And the best thing is, you power the printer, and insert usb in laptop/computer and goto printer settings, and when you add printer, the driver of the printer self-installs. I have also ordered ""Apple Leaders Printer Dust Cover for Brother HL-L2321D"". You see I have Brotherly feelings already towards this new possession."
5,Print quality is supper.....Its easy to install......It's also a user friendly printer.....It will print only when the command is given from a computer...It will not support mobile printing....
5,"This is an efficient and reliable single function monochrome printer! I was looking for a good laser duplex printer. After a lot of search, I found this printer to be the most appropriate. In fact, I wanted to get a colour laser printer but found them to be very expensive and unnecessary as colour prints are rarely needed. The toner costs are astronomical! If a single original black toner cartridge costs half the cost of this printer, imagine the cost of coloured toners! Besides the initial cost of a laser colour printer is outrageously high. So unless you really need one, don‚Äôt waste your time looking for one. Inkjet colour printers are cheaper so you can opt for them. But be advised that they aren‚Äôt easy to maintain. Unlike inkjet printers, ink leaks won't occur even if the laser printer isn‚Äôt used for a long time.Setting up this printer was very easy and I had it running in minutes. Duplex printing is fantastic. It saves paper, time and energy. The paper tray stacks 250 papers neatly within the printer. Always use dual print compatible papers to avoid causing paper jams or poor quality prints. The toner (TN-2365) that comes with the printer has a stated capacity of 2,600 pages. But eventually the number will be close to 1,500 pages. If you use the toner saver mode then it may reach 2,000 pages. Additionally, the drum (DR-2365) which houses the toner will also have to be replaced after every 12,000 prints. The print speed is impressive. It can print 30 (A4) or 32 (Legal) pages in a minute. I have printed 750 pages at once all under 30 minutes. I haven‚Äôt had a single paper jam or any other issue while doing it and in all the 6 months use. This implies reliability.Compatible refills and cartridges are easily available for this model and costs a fraction of what an original toner cartridge (costs Rs. 3,000) would! Compatibles will affect the print quality to an extent and depending on their quality and how the cartridge is refilled, it may cause leaks within the printer. Therefore care should be taken regarding this. Do note that compatibles will void the printer‚Äôs warranty. So it would be better to go for compatibles after the warranty period. Being compact, it occupies less space. It comes in a two tone appearance (Black and Grey) and doesn't have wireless printing. The similar all black colour"
4,"Ordered Friday, received Monday, so amazing delivery right off the bat.Print quality is crisp and clear.I print a lot of documents and books hence the auto duplex. But when I gave an auto duplex print, it only printed half a page on one of the sides. Bummer!Called customer care. Very responsive. I was personally attended to the very next day and when I gave a print, the duplex worked just fine! Isn't that how it always goes?Pros:Cost, Print Quality, Customer CareCons:Expensive original cartridge, Single functionAll in all, when it comes to low end laser printers, this seems like a winner. I'll update my review after a couple of months or if I encounter any trouble."
3,I brought this in 8500 rs . At  this is  price this is the best .But I would suggest Invest some more . And you will get Inktank printer aroung 10k Which are much better than laser .printing cost is less in ink tank .Also you can get colour and other features like scan .The Toner refuling is headache for laser printer . and after 10000 print you have to replace the cartage . which costs around 2000 .But in inktank there is no headache . Easy to refiil .
1,"After warranty period ends, printer breaks down.Brother will charge 50% of printer cost to replace the circuit board.Avoid at all costs. Absolute junk"
5,At this price range Duplex printer means you put some 300 odd sheets and forget and give print command and it prints both front and back in a jiffy.I even printed my Study materials  PDF in a jiffy.Just combine all those study material pdf  and press print and rest it will do printing by itself no worry about paper reverse and all all done it itself .Just use it wisely easy to intall .At this prince range worth it .Don't worry about replacement cartridge even just as razor and blade marketing the toner is priced high .But still worth it.
5,Writing review after use of 1 year. Got best quality prints . Still not face  serious issue. Refilling is easy. Duplex printing is very fast.
1,"I have used printers from almost all brands be it HP, Samsung, Cannon etc. This is my second Brother printer. The first one worked for 7-8 months and then the printer died on us. This one has stopped working in a month. I strongly don't recommend Brother products just because of the built quality. They offer excellent value for money until they are working but unfortunately they dont work more than few months and in this case not even a month."
5,"I own several printers for my office and of each kind ink tank , laserjet , thermal etc and of every price point. but this baby  is awesome. it does the job perfectly and accurately. and those who think that its too expensive as its toner and drums cost more... you should never buy the original toner and drums. always go for a local printer shop and ask them for a refil.  200 rs is what i pay here for refill. Good day my nibbass"
1,"I received the printer day before yesterday. Yesterday I tried printing. But it always gives printer jam error. Followed all troubleshooting instructions. Checked paper tray, drum unit, back side. No paper found anywhere. Also tried different types of papers. No luck. Will try one more time today, then return it if it does not work still."
5,Bought it after reading the reviews and considering my requirements which was small sce printing of study materials and stuff..So opted for this duplex model..very fast and prompt printing..once or twice faced paper jamming issue..Must use paper thickness above 70mm..otherwisethere are sligh chances of jammingduring duplex printing ..Anyway sorting out a paper jam was super easy as there are brother's own step by step YouTube tutorials..Avoid it all together by using good quality paper esp during duplex..I am quite satisfied with the product..
5,"I have had 3 inkjet printers before this. 2 of HP and 1 of Lexmark. Initially all of them behaved well but as soon as the cartridge exhausted, with a refill, they started giving trouble. Finally with a couple of cartridge changes I had to throw them out as scrap.With a couple of thousands rupees more this is proving to be a delight. I am an author. I have already printed the manuscripts of 2 of my books with 272 and 230 pages respectively. Whereas printing a single book of 250 pages on inkjet used to prove to be a half day task, this did the job in 15 mins. flat.Pros- Installs like a breeze.- Easy to handle- High speed printing- Crisp and sharp prints- No need for frequent paper feeding(takes 250 sheets in the in-tray)- Automatic both side printing (Duplex printing. Especially beneficial for manuscript printing)Cons- No Wi-Fi connection- No scanner- Somewhat heavyBut then one cannot expect everything at this price point. I cost me a mere 8500/-."
4,"I have used this product for a few days now, and admittedly, the printer does what it claims well. The printer produces relatively sharp pictures in black and white and is the ideal device for someone who needs a durable laser printer and does not want to spend to much on it. The printer supports double sided printing, which is common, but still a good feature to have nonetheless. The page tray claims to be able to hold above 200 pages, but it may vary based on the quality and thickness of the paper. The installation process was the easiest part and took nearly 10 minutes to get it up and running. The product is cost-efficient and can support office environment and house environment based on your requirements. One thing I do not particularly like about this product is the printing speed, however, given the price and the quality, its a forgivable factor.Overall recommend this product to any person who is looking for a basic printer that can help them with their black and white printing requirements."
5,Fully satisfied with the product.I think best duplex printer in this rate.Very good print.
5,"Overall printer is a good choice for monochrome printing purposes.Pros:1) Functional-Printing Quality is very good with duplex printing. Duplex printing is fast, simple and well automated.2) Build Quality:- Printer is robust and have great build quality.3) Printing tray capacity: Qty I haven‚Äôt measured but it can take easily 100 sheets.4) Cartridge: Long Lasting Cartridge with very easy installation..Guided by there Manual.Cons:1) Space required: Lot of space is required around 500mm x 500mm.2) Connector cable: Since it is a wired printer Its cable is small in length."
5,Top class printer. I have total 3 Brother printers at my shop All are work horses. This is a sibling of 2541. But only print. No scan and xerox. 2541 I have still and it has printed more than 2 lakh pages. I know this printer also will go beyond 2 lakhs. Thank you brother.
5,Nice printer at a price of Rs.7379/- .Ordered on the 16th Oct just as soon as The Great Indian Shopping Festival started..They promised a same day delivery..But had delivered on the next day..Still thats awesome isnt it..Got an awesome Rs.1100/- discount due to the Festive Sale period..Non-offer price was 8499 then..Prints quite nice..just hope the machine lasts long enough..I chose Amazon because of the delivery speed promised and they have kept their promise quite well..Other apps were giving me a 12 day delivery period unlike Amazon..Amazon had given a same day delivery promise..The printer is also very easy to install..
3,called Brother to ask for return - no because I should have researched it myself - their site doesn't mention it DOES NOT support Chrome OS - work around? connect to a USB-router and hope for the best after configuring it with a win/mac laptopotherwise probably the best price/quality laser printer you can find - get the extra toner and refills...
5,"Good value product with duplex feature. With easy double side printing, it saves a lot on paper. So far no paper jams. Small minus is it‚Äôs a little noisy compared to my earlier HP."
5,"I'm using a laser printer for the first time. Installation was very easy - youtube videos by the manufacturer itself defines steps from unboxing to finish installing toner cartridge. Loading A4 paper is pretty simple.For Windows, driver and if needed additional printer management softwares can be downloaded from Brother website. I am able to print from Android phone via USB OTG using some software on play store, and it went well.I chose 600dpi medium quality setting before printing pages of text and mild graphics, and it all went well. Prefer draft mode or 300dpi for printing images, otherwise toner consumption rises and image may look too dark.This does automatic duplex printing and it works well. Very happy with the purchase. Printer is so simple, humble, capable and value for money. Also compatible toner cartridges are available but seeing so many complaints related to print quality and duplex printing; so better to stick with genuine toner cartridge (gives 2600 pages) from Brother and cost per page is very cheap as home use is concerned."
5,"Update as on 28 July 2021 after 7 month usage.This still works like a gem. No complaints so far. Printed around 1900+ pages so far and it is still showing around 35% ink remaining. Go for it!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Using it for last couple of months .. Great purchase .. Loving it.I have used multiple color printers before and most of them lasted for less than 2 years. The last one was HP Deskjet ink advantage 3525, which was working well for more than an year and then it stopped printing due to printer head malfunction as we couldn't use this printer for 2 to 3 months in between which may be the reason for this issue. I was kind of fed-up with these issues and thought of trying an economical laser printer as laser printer doesn't need the monthly duty cycle.Loving this Brother laser jet so far and as of know looks like a terrific purchase. Only one practical issue is that there is no WIFI and we need to use laptop or desktop with usb to print. But i am used to it now. Printed around 700 pages so far and still showing around 75% ink remaining.ProsEasy to installGreat quality printingFast printing compared to previously used color printersDuplex PrintingHaven't faced any paper jam issues so farEconomicalConsNo WiFiOverall great product!"
5,"Post lockdown, there were lot of printing to do for my kid.. I looked for ink jet and ink tank but every professional printer suggested to go for laser as if your weekly print count is 5-10 and u don't want to spent a lot on the long run then go for laser given its low maintenance. Brother was a good fit and they are durable."
5,7999/-24hr delivery and it's a first class product with good packaging.Worked on 1st attempt itself.Easy to install and use.Buy 1yr extended warranty at 349/- giving peace of mind.Register for warranty and support.Reliable brand like a Brother. I liked it
4,"For those who want only black and white printouts, this is the best. Although the plastic made of the machine feels little delicate. Easy to install and use. There is no scanner and color print in this. Multifunctional printers only make the system more complicated when repairs come and expensive. Otherwise, you can buy them separately and use, all come to the same cost as a multifunctional printer."
3,"I have brought this product after a lot of surfing and thinking.Brother is less in price compared to those pronounced brands. I m a student switched to laser printer because it's maintaince is very less compared to any other type of printer.I think this printer is ok with everything but it's price per page is high..Toner is not easily availableLet me use it for some time ..Next I will provide much better information with experience..1st Edit after 4 months of usage Well uptil now it has worked nice,"
1,"I purchased this (as a stand-by) mainly because of many reviews saying they have experienced no paper jams. contrary to this claim, from the first day i am experiencing paper jams every time i use this machine. even now, after four months, after experimenting with various good quality printing papers, it jams at least once a day.. sometimes two sometimes four papers are dragged in. despite fanning all the sheets, etc this happens. useless brand. print quality, auto-duplex etc work well. i like the separate drum feature also. my first printer, ricoh 3510sf (also purchased on amazon in 2016) gave me hell with combined drum and cartridge."
1,"Dear all , first of all i want to thank amazon to deliver the products to our door step at such a reasonable price, so here is my experience with the  order of brothers printer -I got the printer a day late due to a silly confusion of the delivery partner ,and once the product was delivered , the box was opened upon opening follwing were our findings -- the printers toner were allready installed and the toner kit which stores the toner were torn -on further inspection to our utter shock ,when we opened the paper tray we found papers with appolo hospital bannergatta road letter heads- upon opening the toner loading area we found the toner to be covered with carbon residue , which occurs if the laser printer is usedAfter the afore said findings , it was pretty clear that the seller had sent us a used product , not only that they dint even have the time to take out the previous organisations letter heads , once this was established i called the amazon helpline where they were really helpful and assured .e for a return pickup for 11th april , and refunding the amount to the amazon pay balance - but due to this negligence we have lost our valuble time , it would be great if amazon as an organisation takes care of things like these , once the complaint is made and proven - regards and good wishes to all Ranveer"
4,"Very easy to use - very good black-and-white printer. But no wifi!!  So if you are looking for wifi laser printer, you have to spend more moneySometimes some black marks come - but you can clean it by removing and moving the green part shown on brother printer cartridge. Simple work to be done every 2-3 weeks or so."
5,"Excellent printer with auto duplex printing facility, highly reasonable price. Working very well. One of the oldest printer company. Very low priced cartridge. I would strongly recommend the printer. Just go ahead and buy it."
5,"This lazer printer is fantastic value for money. Printer is a USB only which is okay as I don't have more than one computer to connect to. However, recommend a wireless one if you have more than a single user at home.Otherwise, print quality is good - very quite and simply works the way it is designed. Not too many fancy buttons and easy to clean. Fits perfectly on the desk. Duplex printing is great too. No paper scrunching unlike other expensive printers still do it. Easy to install the cartridge by following instruction sheet. no loose parts.Highly recommend this product for a trouble free printing."
1,The disappointment was that of the missing security label on the package. No where it was to be found after screening through the areas based on the instructions. Such experiences hinder online procurement and search for genuine products. I have requested for a replacement which I hope is up to the mark and policies of Brother.
4,"Hey, its better than i expected.  I used to have Canon LBP 2900 but after using this Brothers printer, i never touch that Canon.  It prints like a breeze, the print quality is superb.  Canon was very durable, i dont know if this Brothers printer is going to be durable or not.  So, in comparison, this printer is better in every way except for durability which is not yet known."
5,"Order on 9 april 2019,Recvd on 13 april 19 as amzon commited.1.product is awesome size(occupied less space) and print quality best in this price range.2.only for B/w printing.3.as b4 purchasing i have read all reviews that y i have installed driver B4 delivery.4. 1 page of user guide given in the box conatin installation information on pictures for but prectically they should elobirate the contain of information with guidence.As confusing things in this area.a rope like polytechnic material coming out from cartirage it should be pull/remove given in picture so plz note that it must be remove B4 printingB.

I am not technical expert but giving advice, if you need 100 -200 printing pages per month then pantum p2200 is best."
5,"Hi All,  After finalizing that I have to buy laser printer to make cost effective printing, I did lot of research and found that other brands are very expensive, went for Pantom printer after seeing YouTube videos. Got the delivery on 21st Jan 2019 and found the printer setup to absolutely smooth. The print came out very nice and found much better than my expectations.Recommend others if you are not looking for only branded products."
4,Good printer but only thing missing is that  you can't do WiFi printing unlike other modern printer but for that you can spend more if you want WiFi printer.
1,This Printer is best in all aspects but the only reason for which I have to return it is ..you cannot easily get it's refil toner and when I tried it was not available in India only.So what's the use of having a printer when you can't refill it's toner.
1,I have used printer rarely and that too for only 6 months. First paper started printed crocked and after 20 to 25 prints it started getting blocked inside the printer. It's getting jammed. Plus tried technical support number 1800-419-3160 from their website and its not valid number. It's better to spend 1K to 2K more and buy better printers rather than going for this one.
1,The Things i dislike about it is that the printer doesn't worth the value it was sold because it is very very slow and generate lots of heat please if there is any help you to assit me i will welcome it
3,Quality of printer is not so good than other branded lazer printer as printer is much lighter. It is economic than inkjet and deskjet printer. Overall good.Refillable cartridge in it but slightly costly and branded lazer printer. So if you have heavy printing usethan don't buy this printer. But I'd you have less than 5 page per day work than you can buy it.
1,Worst product. I ran out in all ink filling shops to fill the toner and no one is filling the toner and nearly 20 days I used this product and I was compelled to buy another branded printer for my use. Useless product
5,"I was initially skeptical about buying this printer as it was low budget and a laser printer, but this is turning out to be perfect for the last 2 months I have been using it.  I can say I am happy with it till now and no problems.  Lets see how it holds out and how much prints its able to give genuinely."
5,Small sturdy economical . windows 10 drivers not in the CD but not a big issue. Easily downloaded from official site.
5,"The printer is really good for office use. Installation was very easy. The software provided was easily installed on the PC and the Printer was also installed immediately.The print quality is not too good but can be accepted. The print speed is little slow, pooling is slow.Overall a good printer at given price."
5,Using the printer for few months. Print quality is good. It is value for  money. My usage is 5 to 8 prints per week. So not sure of toner capacity.
3,"SLOW PRINTING SPEED, ONLY STARTER CARTRIDGE PROVIDED, NO PUSH BUTTON ON/OFF ON FRONT PANEL, ECONOMICAL MODEL, SPACE SAVING, DURABILITY YET TO BE ASCERTAINED. OVERALL A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT."
4,"This is the best laser printer for small office or home. Looks like very good and compact. Easy to install to computer. So, this is the best laser printer in 6000 cost."
5,"Nice product, print quality is better, but you have to download driver from website, Driver CD provided is not running in my system."
5,"Its fast, easy install and ink consumption is very gud thats y print is not very jet Dark. Wifi only external internet wifi router has work not direct phone other device All over is gud... Best item"
4,"Nice printer fast, competitively priced well built. Print quality is also good. Regarding toner cost,refilling etc only time will tell."
5,Nice product
1,For personal works and light duty this printer is the best.
1,"Don't buy it ,, it's cartidge is very expensive"
4,Printer is good and clear printout.
5,"No doubt , Product is good , as per specification , you can  print around 700-800 pages after that you need refill the tonner , refilling is very easy, for this printer you need non magnetic ink.  Finally I want to say that the print quality  is good.  Thanks to seller."
4,Costlly print 1page = 3rs
1,Just 3 monthsRibbon and chip gone badRepair parts are not available in market go for reputated brands instead
1,Within 3 months the drum became defective. In the centre the it does not print at all(Checkphotos). Totally worthless product. Go for HP or canon. They have better customer care.
1,Chartege chip not working after six month
1,"Waste product, printout quality is very poor,"
3,no
1,Please don't buy its getting over heated
5,Pleasure to use. Been around 2 months since I bought. It's really good. Only problem is sometimes few papers together get inside and u tend to miss the sequence of printing. Otherwise it's good.
5,"good quality product, please provide support how to fill cartridge, any support"
5,Iam very happy with this product build quality as well as print quality. Very nice product.Thank you Pantum for making such better product
5,Good only problem is china made
1,the supplier does not include the toner cartridge without which the product does not work
5,Easy to use very good printer
5,I was skeptical about buying this printer but after using it for a week I am fully satisfied..best prints in affordable price range.just go for it.
5,easy to install. good quality printout
4,"Print quality is good, but shining is missing. Overall this is a good product."
5,Installation process seems quite confusing initially. But after installation so easy to use
1,Worst product. Worst printing
1,Today received package.. Setup done correctly.. but not single page came out printed.Printer unable to print pages ....blank pages comes out of tray every time !!!!Pls suggest any setting or thing need to done with initial setup which I might not done yet...OR is it defective piece ???
1,"This device is having a severe issue while connecting to Apple devices, namely apple iMac, Macbook Air.Its an issue with drivers as drivers are not functioning appropriately on apple devices.Logged a case with Epson technical support team and received pathetic response from them as they are saying that this is an issue with Apple devices and they want apple to create drivers for Epson product... Pathetic...Technical team is not a technical one.. worst experience.. Never go for this product if you want to use it on Apple device and also you are not bothered for any technical support may need in unavoidable circumstances. Pathetic experience..."
5,"This is currently the best inktank printer one can buy in this price range. Very satisfied. One would not miss the touch screen as once u connect the printer with ur phone with epson app, all the functions can be accessed and setting can be configured. Scan quality is very good and this is one of the best printers you could buy for photo printing. The quality is very good. There aren‚Äôt any problems but if I have to nitpick, I found that the print speed to be slow when u give colour print through phone. That might not be the case with everyone as I could have a problem with my network or it can be fixed in a software update. Other than that, this is the printer you can chose blindly for home and home office. Very satisfied and finally the per page cost is also very low compared to inkjet pronters. The right fit for my home and I believe for many homes tooüëçüèª"
5,"If you were using CHEAP Inkjet Printers with expensive Ink or EXPENSIVE Laserjet Printers with EXPENSIVE cartridge then it's about time you switched.Bought on 19th June 2019, Delivered on 24th June 2019.Used for 1 day, but took about 600 prints in a day. Both, coloured as well as black n white.Opinion - Excellent print quality and very cheap also.Basically, the print quality will not be upto the level of a laser jet but the cheap operational cost makes it worth buying. For whatever purpose you want to use it, the prints are awesome. Even the photos are printed in an excellent manner on any type of paper.Before judging the quality please ensure that you choose the correct type of paper you are using in the printer settings. Example - If you choose glossy paper in the settings for a photo but are using a normal A4 paper then the print will not be that great. Whereas, if you choose A4 paper (Plain Paper/Bright White Paper) the same print will come in an excellent quality.The printer has wifi direct option, if the printer is in range then kindly use the network of Printer itself, it is quite fast. If you are using it in an office then you can use it over a Wifi network (Setup can be done in a normal way using network SSID also and using WPS button on the router also).The printer is fast when Standard quality is selected for printing whereas the printing is slow when High Quality is selected as it takes more details into consideration (For reading purposes, not much difference between both, Standard is the option you should choose).For printing double sided, settings need to be selected from the printer properties. It is not automatic, so you yourself will have to take out the paper and input again in the manner shown in the dialogue box which appears automatically. It is hassle free and printing speed is good.I would definitely recommend buying this printer to everyone. It is economical, convenient and user friendly.PS - You might decide on the basis of other reviews also but then again I have tried and tested the printer. I bought Onsite extended warranty for 2 years also so I'm set for a period of 3 years without any hassles. I hope the review helps. If you have more money go for the one with digital display, but do check the quality of printing on that over youtube reviews before buying."
1,"Very very bad product . Stay away from buying.1. Build Quality is very poor , very poor quality plastic used. feels like it may brake here and there.2. Initial Setup is very much difficult. there is no display so its really very hard to input ip address and ip details.3. Wifi direct is there. but no where the password is written.4. Wifi network address needs to be configured each time the printer is powered on.i am not able to take a colour print or scan a page as set up is yet to be done. will write the print quality after the setup and first use."
1,This thing does not work. I tried to reach Epson customer service but couldn't connect. Amazon customer service is also not helpful. Both Epson and Amazon are giving bad experience.
1,"L3150 is not a good printer , printing is very slow , scanning is also very slow copy is very very slow"
5,Good
1,Pls don't waste your money
5,Print quality  is really good. Budget and cost effective printing.
1,"The printer was in good condition the delivery was quick and superb. I called up Epson technical team to send someone for installation. They responded quickly and the guy came in 2 hours.The bad part was that it took him around 1.5 hours to get this printer up and running since there were some initial firmware issues. Once it was resolved the printing was happening correctly but the scanner/copier failed to work at all. The technician tried several times but it did not work. I had to, unfortunately, return the item."
1,"Amazon doesn‚Äôt allow me to return the product. I won‚Äôt be able to return the product after 24h September. They just hold the return date to be passed. The product is not convenient because when a paper is jammed, I have to open the front cover with a screwdriver. I am not willing to do that every time. Please support me for returning the product.Thanks!"
4,Very easy to use and convenience of wifi. Easy setup. Good accurate color reproduction on photos. However on normal kodak photo paper (200gsm) it makes roller marks (multiple vertical lines due to pressure and not ink). I don't know why we can't improve this technology to use something like pinch rollers in cassette decks which dont scratch. Very silly to have this kind of issue in printers made in 2018.
1,"CONNECTING TO WIFI EVERY TIME IS A HEADACHE , IT DOESN'T CONNECT AS QUICKLY AS A CELLPHONE, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THE OLD SETTINGS , SWITCH IT ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT CONNECTED. PRINT SPEED IS TOO SLOW. PRINT QUALITY IS OKAY. IF YOU GOING TO USE IS MAINLY AS A WIFI PRINTER , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS USE AND I AM FED UP WITH THE CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM."
5,"If we use normal paper to print black-n-white, quality is not same like my HP laser printer, but if we use glossy photo paper to print image, quality is just AWESOME! However, I am having problem to understand how it works in wireless mode, it's not very smooth to make it work from Mac or iPad or Android. I would give 10/10 for quality and cost, however ""Easy to use"": 6.5/10. May be we could not figure it out properly :("
5,"Iam writing this after using this printer for a month. Before its purchase i was confused with other printers like most of us are in between hp 410, 415, brother t 510w.To be honest this epson l 3150 is best printer with minimum ink price. Best in class picture prints provided u use fujifilm glossy photopaper of 180 gsm.Very sharp and clear images with original color combination.Photocopy works well u are printing less than 25 prints at a time it works smooth under 60 seconds it will photocopy.All I can say it's the best wifi printer with very easy installation, one can install on his/her own. Wifi direct function is so easy to use.Finally dont read too much reviews  about this just go ahead. Iam using this in my hospital with daily 1 color print and 10 photocopies.Iam fully satisfied."
4,"WFH becoming the norm and not option , I decided to buy a printer to replace my existing defunct printer .Opted for Inktank type over Inkjet type (High Cartridge Cost) and laser (Colour option costly) .Preferred 3 in 1 for easy photocopies at home with Wifi option  for print thru mobile .Selected Epson over HP and Canon on the basis of better printing reports received from online feedback .Ordered Model L3150 which was Amazons choice and best option available at time of order (in price range) .Pros :1) Print Quality is good2) Ink Bottles are good and easy to replace3) Light and Compact design4) Wireless printing is helpful with mobiles , laptops and tabs becoming common5) Easy to set upCons1) Delicate Body . Needs to be handled carerfully . Loading paper Tray gets easily dislocated and difficult to refit.2) Ink wastage in installation . However can be minimized with proper technique3) Customer support is only for receiving calls and they do not have basic idea of the product or installation .4) Configuring Wifi connection and set up requires some effort .5) Remote Printing is possible but cannot scan remotely ."
2,"I like the product though it's not that easy to install for people who are not well versed technically. It can be challenging for them. The wifi is not working so with my very busy schedule I contacted Epson via FB a person always called me at wrong time. I gave a schedule to call me again, but still the person who used to call me called at wrong time. It was very disappointing as the Epson asked me to call the 1800 number to register the complain. I have the call recording to prove this.You will like the printer but the Epson support is very poor. People will regret purchasing the product if at all it goes bad."
3,"Really impressed with product it has many pros and minor cons, I'll explain it to youPROS1) Nice print quality2) Nice design by EpsonCONS1)2) Speed of the printer is really low it get upto 2 pages in 18 seconds(BnW) and 2 pages in 1min (colour)2) Connectivity issues such as wifi or app3)it's really running smoothly till only 200 pages of print but after that Speed is really begin to slow and reduce ink level at a really high speed4) After completing 200 pages of printing, the speed of the printer also slow down, and get only 1 color page in 45 second5) But after all I'd really thankful to amazon, as they return my money back even at the usage of 7 day ( 200 ) pages.So after all I'd like to prefer NO to this printer"
4,This is a direct wifi printer and it's really worth having it. Wifi increased the usability by many fold. Epson creative print application is not supported by this model and to me it's a negative point for the printer. Scanning speed gets reduced after few continuous scan however for few scan it is ok. Photo quality is better then L380 and is acceptable. Roller mark as vertical lines are observed on photo that is negative for photo printing. Epson demo person are not equipped to give demo with demo photo print.
1,"People who are looking to have a printer, but not used regularly should avoid this printer . Reason being black ink gets clogged if not used daily and to unclog it we have to do nozzle clean or head clean which takes most of the black ink and is a cost to us.. Also go for laser printer if you want to have prints not regularly.. I have wasted my money taking this and at any point of time to take print I have spend half an hour to 1 hour firstly to clean the nozzle and head and sometimes it also won't work.."
5,We purchased this printer and are happy with the value for money that it is providing us. THANK YOU Epson and Amazon...
5,"Superb printer, exactly what I was looking for.Few points about this printer1. Print quality is great2. Print speed is good3. High page yield 4k mono/7.2k color4. Setup is easy accept setting the wifi part5. Instruction manual given could have been a bit more detailed. No clear steps given on how to set up the connection to home wifi router need to break the head a little bit6. Ink filling is so easy and spill proof design7. Low cost printing per page, 7p for black, 18p for color8. Ink bottle T003 is also reasonably cheap around 400/450 per bottle9. Value for money. One time investment in right direction for longer run10. Scanner and photocopier is so great work like charm11. Already scanned a copy book for my kid. Print quality is in great color even on normal paper, yet to try on photo paper12. A must have for home use or small office purpose13. Light weight and compact design14. Don't think more go for it"
5,"things which I overlooked while buying this1. its wifi printer , its NOT air printer2. It has no screen, so you break your head for error3. it gives you an option of hundreds of apps for epson....you get charmed by their features download couple of them and then one by one it shows that they dont work for the printer model you have4. install driver to print, upload to cloud to print.....;pros1. very fast2. very economical"
5,"Perfect and a very good quality printer. The speed for black and white pages is good, although color print out speed is not so good. However, a high color print speed should not be expected from a compact ink tank printer for home use. Installation is easy and clearly mentioned on the instruction guide. Wifi connectivity can be easily established as per the instruction guide. Epson iPrint app needs to be downloaded on your mobile for direct mobile-to-printer print command. For desktop/laptop, either download the same app or install the application from the CD given. Scanning and photocopying works well. Epson genuine ink cost is ver less compared to HP. Overall, a value for money product as compared to similar other printers esp. HP or Brother."
4,"I am an industrial designer and needs to print a lot of color prints.PROS1) Astonishingly fast print with wifi like 2 pgs per second2) Easy and fast wifi connection3) Clean and 9/10 b/w print quality4) Easy to fill ink tank reffils5) Amazing tech support within 1 day in my case.6) Scan quality is good.7) Smaller than other ink tank printers.8) Very low noise level9) Easy to install paper.CONS1) Decent quality color print. 7/102) Ink depletes 40% faster than claimed.3) After 2weeks the print had lines. i tried to do cleaning as mentioned in manual, no improvement happend. The tech support came in a day. He let the ink tank cap open for 1/2 an hour to let the air in. And print was good again. He suggested me to do so every 15days.4) The ink bottle lasts only 1& 1/4 time. It means you can only fill 1 time at installation and other 1/4 time when ink is finished.5) Confusing and non intuitive control panel."
1,"Third class printer. Stopped printing after 10 days. Confusing setup, No Dispay, Worst printing i ever saw in my life. Third grade plastic quality. Total money wasted.Third class printer. Stopped printing after 10 days. Confusing setup, No Dispay, Worst printing i ever saw in my life. Third grade plastic quality. Total money wasted.Third class printer. Stopped printing after 10 days. Confusing setup, No Dispay, Worst printing i ever saw in my life. Third grade plastic quality. Total money wasted."
4,"Like1) The printer is light and fits well anywhere.2) The print quality is reasonably good3) The refilling of the cartridges is pretty straight forward.4) The WIFI operability is little cumbersome.Dislikes:1) The print rate is painfully slow2) Making the color print work is really painful. I am talking about the initial setup. For some reasons, colors from the color catridge storage container did not flow automatically into the print head. I had to literally use an injection(suction) to get the colors flowing into the cartridges mounted on the print head.Note: This issue is only with the color cartridges but not with the black one. A non-technical user may not like this experience.3) The manual does not clearly explain that Epson software needs to be installed on your mobile phone to be able to print the docs or pics from your cell phone. Had to do lot of research on internet to get it working.Final verdict: Once the initial hiccups were sorted out, its been working well without any issues so far. I would rate it 3.5/5"
5,"Wi-fi based printer and scanner, Good Quality prints with best speed. Light weight and required small place. We can print mobile photo directly using wi-fi"
4,"I previously had a hp 3545 and some of the points I'm drawing a comparison against it. I will not go into too much of the pros as many have already mentioned. I'll give my views on what irritated me the most.1. Build quality is very delicate. My older printer which cost 1/3rd off this price was very solid. This printer feels like if I hold it with firm grip I may end up damaging it.2. Installation was okay but my 1st print itself the paper got jammed. I had to call customer care. I saw that they have to remove screws and open the full top panel to remove pieces of paper stuck to the rollers. Again, was super easy in hp. No need of screws and being extra careful and all.3. Black ink depletion ' the technician told me that the pipe for black is longer than others and hence shows the depletion faster when it is new. I verified somewhere in the manual saying when the ink is installed the first time, the expected yield is not obtained.4. Super slow scanner compared to my older printer.5. The print head needs regular cleaning or else even in high quality print more you'll see bad printing. This cleaning will take some extra ink I guess.6. I thought the ink would be easily available but I see in Amazon itself the t003 black ink is usually not listed or out of stock. Not sure if this corona is the reason or something else."
1,Photo paper is not pulled and hence photo is not printed. It is useless for printing photos. Glossy paper with more than 130 gsm is not accepted. Hence standard 180 gsm photo paper can't be fed. Also the print quality is not true photo quality. Don't buy
1,"Update: I have used this printer for over a month now. Updating the reviews based on photo print quality which I tried today.Pros:- ink is cost effective- WiFiCons- picture print quality is so bad that I want to return the printer (unfortunately it is too late). The pictures are much darker and extremely dull. Printer leaves lines on photo paper, some thing that I have not observed with any other printer. My $50 HP printer, from 2013, prints far better pictures.- slow and stops for buffering when printing using WiFi (I started printing a 17 page pdf (just text) and I finished a 6 inch sandwich before 17 pages were printed. And I did eat in a very civilized manner.- AirPrint is not supported so you are forced to use the Epson iPrint app.- I haven‚Äôt yet figured out a way to scan multiple documents in single pdf format. I see only 3 options jpeg, tiff and 1 more, no pdf.- no lcd screen means I have to use Epson iPrint application.- I haven‚Äôt yet figured out how to print double sided documents. I see the options for page size, quality, orientation etc but on the same page of the application I couldn‚Äôt see the print double sided document.I will update the review if I notice any difference."
5,"i did a through research before buying a printer, i had HP previously which was severely outdated (print cost of Rs 5- 10) with cartridge. Also HP support is abysmal.i had canon and Epson in mind both being intl brand with fairly good support.Pros.- WiFi for both mobile (less useful) and laptop. can connect directly or through router.- tank ink system for better economy of effort.- you can have wireless experience (only one cable of power)- cloud printing- decent scanner.Cons.- box design- it is nozzle of head, have to be fairly regular in operation (once blocked its best to replace)- can't think of any other cons.it is what you pay for, it is cheap in long run, i print usually my office documents and mostly for my daughter's projects, test papers (online classes) and what not.a good buy and i recommend it.the seller is top class and no hassle with delivery.all in all a great experience."
5,"This is really a good printer. I am using this printer since 2 weeks and its really doing its job. Great printer for home use and really cost effective. Printing cost is really low. If you are looking for a good printer for home use or small office its the best printer. I am using with Macbook Air 2020 Intel model and it works great.Pros.1. Printing quality (Colours are really good)- 5/52. Printing cost is very low( 10 paisa for B&W and 18 paisa for color print) - 5/53. Printing speed is really good, takes some time in color print - 4.5/54. Connectivity - 5/55. Compatibility ( I am using with mac, working well ) - 5/5Cons.1. I have to struggle a bit to first time setup with mac, I think setup with windows will be easy.2. If you have dual band router then you have to connect with 2.4Ghz only. but this will not create any problem.Best printer for home & small office use. For homo use you can print very good photographs as well. Works with matte paper, glossy paper. Really good printer for kids projects or colour printing."
1,"First 5 prints on day one was good.  But i made my second attempt 10 days later, and issues creeped up. Black ink was not being used for print. Print quality was degraded. When called the customer service, they told me that their server is down and could not take up my complaint. After my purchase..now patiently waiting to bring my new printer back on line . Its not a good experience"
4,"Good Epson quality. Easy to set up. The wifi setup instructions are quite easy to follow. There is also enough help available on Youtube, etc. Quite economical printing. No more refilling or purchasing expensive ink cartridges. More than enough for a home or a small office. Print speeds for colour docs are not that fast. Also the lack of a feeder arrangement for scanning makes scanning multiple pages tedious as you can scan only thru the glass. Wifi printing is a boon as you can print directly to the unit without depending on LAN. To print from your phone you might need the app though."
3,"The printer is east to setup, just need to follow the instructions. Yet to test a photo quality page.Have got a problem of red and green light blinking together which is blocking from printing anything. Seriously didn't expect this tho happen within 30 days period. I have raised a ticket with Epson support, the service executive mentioned that 2 parts are having problem and need to be replaced. Awaiting for part for the past 2 days"
4,Setting this printer right of the box is a synch except for the WIFI router option.  Hence the reason for 4 star. Luckily YouTube has ton of videos to enable your router to recognize the printer. Without doing the step printing or setting up of the driver on your laptop for wireless printing is pointless. Wish EPSON added this as part of their manual or on their driver website. Everything else worked as mentioned in the printed steps and I was up and running in no time.
1,Tried every thing as suggested online. No relief.  Have not been able to  use it for what it was bought.Still waiting and waiting  and waiting for the local Technical service to attend to it. Local service tried to help online but nothing seems to work.Previous L210 performed flawlessly. This  L3150 one has given me a bad start.EPSON needs to handshake with Microsoft OS at company level and make it easy to install its new products.  Driver loading is a big problem. Down loading Driver  updating etc  from EPSON website also did not help.
1,"Forget plug and play tho it said direct wifi.  in fact, each device needs a long set up and  it does not support Mac airdrop. I had Epson technician to install. It took 3 hours working on an iPad, a Mac and an android phone, And still did not work.. seems only Epson models above Rs.25k will. They really should disclose the problems.. it seems they are not new. A waste of everyone's time and then had to uninstall the vast amount of software that the technician had loaded to try to get it to work. So be careful ."
1,"This printer is a complete waste of time, money and labels. The same command to print works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I have wasted more labels than what I have printed using this god awful printer. Buy a piece of rock instead of this and that will be more profitable for your business. And this product has a Return Policy duration of ""2 and a half seconds"". So if you think you will try it out and then Return it if you don't like it, forget about that. This is a Rs 12,000 bell stuck around your neck and you will never be able to take it off. The hole in your pocket will just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger because you will be wasting more than 50% of your labels. I have realized that within a week of buying this junk."
1,Product is not satisfactory as its ‚ÄúMADE IN CHINA‚Äù there is no warranty and not a good brand for work. Also there is no ribbon with the product you need to buy ribbon and price is higher then expected with quality and service and no ribbon.Not satisfied with product and seller.
5,Been using this for more than a year and i'm completely satisfied with its quality/speed of printing labels.Initially i had a problem with loading ribbons and labels.Watched few videos on youtube and that's it.I don't know why so many negative feedbacks. this is by far my best investment .
1,Don't buy this product. Their service is very poor. I can't able to install the product by myself. I called their helpline number and got the reply that they are not doing any service to customers purchase from Amazon. So I arranged another person for installation and have to pay him. Please don't buy this product.
1,Printer not working. Don't ignore negative reviews. I just wasted the money. Never buy it online.
5,"First of all thanks to Amazon seller. for this productfast label print. best quality this printer. easy to use. packing is also v goodThe TTP-244 Pro is ideal for customers looking for a high-quality barcode printer.Value for money. fast print speed, along with the largest memory capacity in its classIt's v good productBest quality this printerIt's a good value for money as well.Best quality."
5,"This product is very useful and inevitable for E-Commerce Sellers. Normally spending a lot for inkjet/laser/drum printers - Cartridges - to make the shipping labels. But when we had started with this TSC Barcode Printer (Direct Thermal) saving time, money and it's safe for the rainy season (please use good quality shipping labels).100% We can recommend this for E-Commerce Sellers.Thank you."
1,I bought this product in feb 2019 . Right from day one the bar code is not printing well . Scanner not able to read . Dont buy this product online . The seller is not giving any warranty card or any information about the service centre and not able able to contact the seller also . SPJ gadgets private ltd New Delhi  .  When i checked  online the TSC  service  centre number is wrong .
1,"The printer is faulty and doesn't work. Not even the test page prints without an error.  Tried contacting Amazon only to hear that I should contact the manufacturer because Amazon doesn't provide warranty for this. The manufacturer doesn't help customers who bought it from Amazon. So, in turn the entire 11.5K that I paid in down the sewer.The service levels couldn't have went down any further."
4,"All you need to know is how to operate the software called BarTender. The printer has got nothing much to do its all about the alignment you do it in the processing software. But within the budget its an awesome product. Try to keep this printer in a clean and hygienic place, this will increase the life of the machine."
1,Print quality very poor.. Dots comes in between black region.. N fonts becomes too lighy
1,Pathetic product and pathetic after sales service from the seller.
5,Its an excellent printer. I am highly satisfied with the product as well as the customer service for this barcode printer. Seller of this product is really very nice and helpful in providing services to their customers.
5,"Super product, certainly the best , very user friendly, good value for money."
5,Great service by Mr. Surjeet. Thanks a lot for genuine product.

2,"stopped working after two months, waste of money"
1,Worst product and suppliers. Items missing and can not print
5,"At the time of installation, seller help out with proper manner.Good customer service."
5,Choose Bits Online technology while choosing  the seller. One of the best seller and they help there customer in each and every possible way.
1,did not recieve yhe ribbon in the package and also one more item required for installation

4,good product ..but packaging was not good.
5,"Good Product, I am using it from 17-01-2021 and the experience of the first day was awesome. Now I am exploring the printer if anything happened I will mention.First Impression is very very awesome."
5,"Product as expected.Easy to setup.  ( fill the ink, goto setup.brother.com) it will download the required drivers. )Copier is working fine.Scan also fine. ( dedicated software also provided)Print:different profiles available like eco print, mono, Color, etc.The manual duplex option is thereA monoprint is fast as compared to colour. it is expected."
4,"Print quality is decent as expected from inkjet, although ink bottle only contains half a tank worth of inks"
5,I bought this printer after a lot of research and good reviews. I have been using this printer almost every day. This printer comes with all business essentials features that a business may need. You can trust this model blindfoldedly. I am really impressed with this model.
5,"Built quality was excellent, print quality was excellent. Wot was not good or time consuming was installing software from CD provided. It took 2 hours to install software. Rest all ok. Over all best buy."
5,"This is the best Ink Tank Printer I got. Brother is my personal best than other printers in the market. Print quality is best, there is no ink problem in this printer. Black print is spectacular. And most importantly product registration for any Brother printer is quite good and fast. I prefer Brother Printer rather Epson, because of the page loader tray. Brother Printer has a specific page loading tray like xerox machine, but other printer doesn't have that facility, which is mainly problematic to me."
5,"Printer is easy to set-up. Print speed is good, quite fast. I am a bit concerned to see that original Brother ink is not available online. The only original option shown had adverse comments."
5,"Review after 1 month of use -Build quality -- Strong and compact built quality. Light weight, no items projected outside. Strong top cover which is flexible for book printing alsoPrint quality -- I have tried more than 1000+ prints (both color and black) in last 1 month. No problem in ink spillages, printing lines and color variation.- Color print is excellent but take more time- Print, Scan and Copy all are very simple to operate and within 1 day my daughter started using it smoothly.Price -- Budget printer in this category.Unique features -- Inbuilt paper tray for 100+ papers inside the printer- Special feature for ID card printing- Both side printing facility is also possibleSuggestion -- Kindly buy CP-440 printer intead of CP-220 since 220 variant is not having wifi printing/scanning option."
4,Its only a month ago I just printed not more than 200 copies print quality is good but not as cannon.I purchased this because of brother is japanese company.My experience is good print is very fast in term of documents print.software is very user friendly.easy to install
1,1. This printer not supported for Mac - this was my priory use case2. Scan has shade of green color3.paper get named very frequently4. Print speed too slow.
1,"For around 10k rupees this is not worth, not having wifi connection or connecting to mobile for printing..we have many products with all these features for 6k in market"
5,"Build quality -- Strong and compact built quality. Light weight, no items projected outside.

5,"For the price it retailed for at the time of purchase, this is the best printer I have used in my life. Incredibly versatile in its capabilities from scanning to printing.. with options to customise between monochrome to 16/24 bit colour reproduction and a multitude of print/scan dimensions or paper sizes, this an ideal all-in-one solution for office scanning and printing needs. It's colour prints can be set from draft to high or very high quality at 24 bit images, the high and very high quality prints take more time to print since this product is ideal for small businesses or home use, not enterprise or mass printing needs. Can also print all dimensions and custom settings for photo prints ranging from passport to stamp to photo album presets for which it needs standard photograph papers or kodak papers."
5,Am really impressed with this printer from Brother. The scanner and printer work very smoothly without any hiccups. The only drawback i faced was installing this printer via USB on Linux and it took me 3 full days to get things done. My suggestion is that Brother should make the drivers for Linux readily available on their website for a smooth effortless installation.
1,"For someone who's used printers all his life. I would not recommend this one. Cons, the cartridge you get initially. Only fills half the tanks. You can not print with you mobile or tablet. And they have poor customer service.Pros. The print quality is just like any other printer. It prints thats it"
1,Do buy brother printer. Within 1 months it is stop working.  If you print 10 Page  it will print 1-2 print and restart it  again and again . Some time it take hafp page and stop working..Go for hp and canon
1,Within second week of use the printer is not working..
1,Very bad printer and worst printer two printer I received but both are not printing and customers care doesn't pick call many times I called to customer care after 30 minutes of wait but no response
5,Printer and scanner is good. easy to install. No need to search for the drivers. Windows 10 automatically installs the drivers. More economical printer.
5,Print quality is Awesome. Best printer at this price.
3,All functions are good but i'm frustrated from paper jam issues
5,This is the 1st time i ever used ink tank printer.  I must say ... i loved it. Only challenge is it get genuine ink. Hopefully i will get that. Else it will a waste
2,Don't buy brother product because after sell and service are so horrible
5,"Everything is ok... prompt delivery.... Product is very good. Only thing, while installing Hardware person assistance is required to install in Windows 7..."
3,"Software is not good as Epson printer. Bit confusing during installation. During printing any document in black you haven't choice of draft quality, fine quality etc."
1,Worst quality printer
1,Very very very very bad product after replacing the product two times
1,"Don't buy any one, money waste, printing quality is wrost, no return option, only replacement, not satisfied wrost amazon"
5,Installation is quite simple. So far no issues.

5,Good printer with multiple functions available
5,Good
5,Amazing
5,Good product print quality need improvement
1,Very bad condition reach this products... Nd black ink missing... Data cable mising...
5,Simple to install. Works very well.
5,"Does what it says, cost effective"
1,worst product hp brake my trust in three month printer is not working properly and the are not giving us service they told me to courier the cartage to bhopal i talked to bhopal service center they told me it may take atleast 15 day i m getting suffered a lot
1,Only positive is easy to fill.But print quality is horrible. Tried all diagnostics mentioned in document. HP support is also very bad.. at the end they will say you are not using authorized ink fill. Very expensive print..Don't prefer at all..
1,"Printing issue every month. Bad printer. Every month we need to call customer support and get imaging drum replaced. The servicing is also pathetic. It takes 7-20 days for the issue to be resolved and that too during warranty. God knows how bad it will be after warranty. That's not all, you have to follow up on the complain multiple times to get a reply and then again follow up to get a resolution. If you are really interested in this, please hire someone (to manage and follow up with HP support for all the problems you will face every month) while ordering this"
5,"The build quality was fair, but value for money. Print quality is good. Wifi connectivity is good."
2,"Our purchase date is 22-06-2020, so the waranty period ends on 22-06-2020. This printer is not functioning properly currently and we had contacted HP customer care for the repair and came to know that the warranty period for this product has expired and we were informed that any service from their end will be chargeable. This is very surprising to us as we had purchased it on the above date. We were informed by HP that this product was not updated by the seller ( Amazon ) and because of this we are facing such problems. You are asked to update HP about this product immediately, so that we can receive their free service within the waranty period. Please send us your confirmation after this is shorted out and also take necessary action so that in future your customers does not face such problem"
5,Xyz
5,"I was pleasantly surprised with the performance of this printer. I was earlier using a Deskjet printer and in comparison, this printer is a lot faster.I typically use printer to print office invoices. It used to take me hours to do this activity on my old printer while now it takes me hardly a few minutes.Printer is very fast and print quality is great. Setting up the printer was quite easy and the HP Smart app makes it very convenient to setup and use the printer."
1,The driver cd is missing
4,"Printing quality is very nice. But installation was not so easy. Amazon should allot service for installation or better you can buy in offline store. Ink filling was little risky and it's very hard to remove the cartridge. But you can get help from HP customer care by an video call like me.Worth for buying.Good for billing or single side printing.Looking for laser printing then you must try this.A quality product. Go for it, highly recommended."
4,"The printer build quality is OK. Not heavy duty and we need to take good care of it. At this price, its a bit expensive. HP should include a proper sized printer cover to protect it from dust. Wifi based printing and its setup is super easy. Once you make the printer discoverable on network, you can print it it with almost any device anywhere in your home. No dependency on physical connection apart from power."
5,"Its compact in design & print quality is sharp & clear. Tried for grayscale & B&W photos & text as well. However, printer setup is slightly confusing to start with as I had to decide whether I want to use over wi-fi or USB. However, I wanted to be used over both. With some re-installations & some setting change, I am able to use with both at same time. While reviewing, I haven't taken many prints, so mileage is unknown."
5,Easy installation and works very wellIntegrated feature to  add toner powder from top without having to dis-assemble anything (instead of having to change the whole toner cartridge) marks this model from others in this price bracket.
4,"Although I just bought this printer a few days ago, the warranty shows only nine months are left. I have no clue on why it is so. Amazon should keep a tab on resellers and ensure customers get the full one-year warranty. Otherwise the printer is quite good."
4,"The printer is really good and easy to install the instructions given are really easy to follow and it can be connected to different devices too. The printing quality is also good. The warranty and ink cartridge can be available by scanning the code which is attached in printer's body, so it's easy for us in future too. Like this product"
4,"The ""best quality print"" Feature does not work. It's economical n fast because of the cheap refiling cartridge made available."
5,Easy to setup. Amazing quality print. Though this is only one day after the use. I hope my perception will continue on this product
3,There is no toner with this printer. But customer questions-answer section has confirmed that it will also have a toner.
5,The best feature of this printer is ease of use and easy to fill ink . Print quality is good and speed is fast
5,"It's such a relief to have a reliable printer....After past experience with a cheaper, well known brand of printer that constantly let us down, this printer absolutely brilliant. It was easy to install too!"
5,"Works well as per promised, nice quality and fast too."
5,Best in this range
1,Installation difficult.Attention Light kept blinking for long. Stopped after very long by itself.The Top cover is not fittingNo prints are coming on paper.
5,"No need for  transfer documents received in mobile  to laptop or pc,can easily print them over wifi or via google cloud print"
5,Good printer.  I did not use for 3 months due to corona. Still no issues in printing. Good product. Print quality is good
5,Overall good product one of problem no customer support on phone. They offered only virtual support
1,The extra toner cartage is missing
1,Heavy printing cost.
3,the outer box of the printer was in very bad condition when it came. The printer is good but has some printing issues when comes to printing labels.
5,Started using it with my Macbook pro..Wifi wireless command for print..easy to use .. print quality good
5,Good one
1,Worst printer ever expensive printing rs 2 per page
5,Good easy to Use üëç.
1,Don't buy
5,Good printer with WiFi
1,"The printer was purchased on 21 July, 2020 but became defective just after 5 days of installation. We could just print about 20 pages on 2 ocassions within a span of 5 days on receipt and installation. On 3rd time on 04 Aug, 2020, it failed to switch ON and gave error message of system initialize problem. HP service engineer visited to repair it and suspects major problem in internal components but the company has refused to replace the printer, as whole.Item not worth purchasing and I feel let down by the brand name of HP.Example of poor customer care/regard by HP."
1,"It's just a wired printer, not working for e print , google clouds print , apple print . Cheating customers by giving wrong description.Don't buy there are so many other options available with low price"
5,"First reviewed a lot on HP laser printer for home use, purchased this and, fully read the manual, enabling wifi or wireless use for printing and scanning is very simple.  Unless and only if manual is followed in order to configure then only everything becomes easy to use.will update later"
1,"The product is ok. But Amazon has provided partial information about the product. Its a manual duplex printer and not an automatic one. And this information is nowhere mentioned in product description, while all the gazillion other details are there. I found out about it only when my 10 day return/replacement policy on the product expired and AMAZON clearly refused to help me with matter. Neither did they owe it up to their mistake of providing partial information. Will NEVER again order anything expensive from Amazon. Customer care is pretty useless."
5,"Best part : manageable size, acceptable print,scan and Xerox. No Hassel of ink drying if not in use like inkjet. Excellent WiFi connectivity using HP smart App. Recommended when you suddenly need prints /scan and Xerox sometime and no use some time.Not an color printer. Laser color printers are not proven at these price."
5,Great product
5,I use it for home purpose. very easy to use. design is subtle and simple. and i am impressed by brilliant packaging by amazon. i received it in very nice shape. only problem is digital screen is small and has no light in background so it is little bit hard to read. still this printer is amazing.
1,Good evening sir. Instead of laser M1005 model I forgot to by this. Kindly change it as soon as possible sir. Very few days only I used this printer. Kindly take bake and change Lacer M1005 model sir. This is my humble request sie
5,Very easy to install. Has great print quality.Scan quality is also not bad. You just need HP account and an app then you're good to go from any device. Just keep in mind you remove all the packaging even inside the printer next to cartridge. It is plastic n can melt if not removed.
5,"USB & WiFi Direct is working excellent.But when we connect laptop give print, error message will display (use USB). After reinstall of software working fine, but everytime can't do the same. Once switch off & on it will appearing but not able connect laptop with the same WiFi network."
1,waste of money always showing low tonner even after filled also
1,"Sad to write neither Amazon nor HP does bother to help in giving a demo on how to connect and use.Thanks to COVID restrictions , HP is enjoying on poor service."
5,A versatile laser printer at an attractive price point for those who have low to medium printing volumes
5,The product meets the quality and specification of a branded item. Very happy
5,"The Wireless facility and Mobile printing is very useful. Easy to print anything in your mobile like whatsapp documents, photos etc..etc..using HP mobile app. Scanner and copier also useful to reduce our stress"
1,Product is too bad and after purchase their service is too bad
4,Good product for printing and also scanning. nice product but I received only few days . You can also not buy this product.
5,Good Printer... Let's wait to see it's cartridge printing and refilling cost and other maintenance...
1,HP has one of the worst Customer Support. Instead of sending somebody and resolving the issue they have wasted previous Business hours.
4,this printer is amazing easy to used .printing speed os pretty good and sharp print details üëç
1,Hp not any support .. very bad quality printer don't buy hp any product .
3,Printer sims to be good but not that is showing the image.Also not known why the warranty is only for 7 months ?? Please revert on this point ??
4,Overall good no doubt
5,Have had a positive experience with the product. It's quick and neat!
4,Colour print is not availableImprovement needs with apple devicesToner replacement cost is high
3,"Product is ok, but HP support is pathetic, you have to approach several times to get the work done. Not expected this from HP"
2,Toner cartridge dry and not working. So no question of rating a printer. Please supply a functional one immediately.
5,Use very easy
4,Printer cost would have been a little low
5,Nice
5,Great product with indeed a impressive performance.
1,only 300 paper prinoutwifi connectivity is very poor

5,"HP printer works efficietly, it is value for money."
1,Local tonner in the printer. Never buy online.
3,Two side print experience is very bad
1,"HP Neverstop Laser 1000a Printer purchase proved waste. I paid unnecessarily Rs.13499/- under false features shown on Amazon that it can print, scan and copy. But factually it can only print, In picture Toner Feeder shown whereas it is not given. For the false promise, I want to file the court case against Amazon and Appirio Pvt. Ltd Bangalore. Why this cheating in online business.  First, satisfy me by replacement of printer otherwise certainly I will put the case in the court of law and bring the matter to Finance Minister of India"
1,"1)Printer not give u print as by mention.....2)after 1200 normal word print, toner indication light is full, but print comes light, technician will visit, and of course you will get the toner replacement, but you have to visit service center by ourself with the toner, and replacement will get after 20 days....3) again i face the same issue after 700 to 800 print is done, then i have to repeat all the same process again....till then my warrenty is over, as sson as i get the toner , power board also get damaged (print comes full black).4) no spares wiil be available easily, because machine is newly lauch and i think not good...."
4,"Printer is good but pictures of the product is misleading, from picture it seems cartridge is also included but not this a case. Print single side only. Both side printing is time consuming and cumbersome."
5,"This printer is very easy to handle and operate. If you need printing very frequently and want it to be cost-effective, then this is the product you are looking for.Reviewing after using it for almost 20 days"
4,fast and cool look but have issues with manual duplex printing. often find broken page during manual print on both side.
5,i was little fear while buying this seeing all negative review i was using this machine for 4month still it is keep on printing the printing quality is super highly recommended for small scale business owners
5,"Awesome, value for money,i got it for 11000"
4,I use this product for general purpose i.e in home. This product is doing well
5,overall good
5,Amazon not given proper instructions.
4,Overall nice performance in terms of speed but a bit costly in terms of cost per print
2,"Not good, there is no wi fi connection  is established."
5,Nice product
4,Nice product
1,Waste
1,"If the printer works it prints well. But It starts giving problem within 15 days of installation.  One fine day  you switch it on a yellow indicator will light up near the toner loader and a triangle with  exclamation and the printer will show offline. THE TONER LEVEL INDICATOR IS FULL. It refuses to come online. In 15 days they gave me a replacement printer. The replacement printer developed the same problem in the next 15 days. When you receive a replacement printer they will never inform you that you need to get the warranty updated. They don't have proper procedures. You have to make calls to get Replacement Certificate. The response time with HP is so called 24 hours to 48 hours. in reality they MAY respond after 6 working days. That is 8x6=48. You have to shout your way out.  When you call HP service it will take them such a long time to respond to your call. You have to go through 2-6-2-2 The call-BUCK (yes, b-u-c-k) passes through a series of tables. In the mean time the line gets cut. you have to start all over again. They will never call you back.  If you want to avoid BP please keep off from HP."
3,Does it support Legal / FS size printing ?
5,Very good
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,Epson L3110 printer is not good its worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper setting is problem West your money Epson service center said about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this model i safar this
4,This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer7) follow the process as in the CD.Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.
5,"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly."
1,"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON  L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of  getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience  specially when you have a lots of  color copies to do.PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm.  ONE MORE major  problem is print head need  to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the  EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes."
1,Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..
1,"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money."
4,I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printerPros1.Epson customer service is very good2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp andCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canonCons:-1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb versionAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the appI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpfulAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon
4,"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate."
1,Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good printDaily you have to do head cleaningNo worth of buying this
5,"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottleüòú5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing headWill post a long term review after few months"
1,Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.
2,Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........
1,Pathetic support...Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....Disappointed with EPSON....
1,"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning"
1,"This product has had a lot of defects with the print quality and the print heads. In the 6 months since I have bought it, I have had to call Epson Service 5-6 times. They changed the inner motherboard once and have cleaned the print heads, nozzles and the connections multiple times Everytime they come. 3/4ths of the black ink has gone into this without any left over for printing. When I asked for in warranty replacement, Epson refused. It has been less than a month since the last Service and again the black cartridge is not printing. Lost time, effort and almost 11K Rupees because of this product. Never works when a printout is required.Defective product but worst service and warranty maintenance by Epson. Never buying from Epson again."
5,"Bought it almost 4 months ago and I must say, this is a very good printer. Effortless to use and One thing I must mention is that, it printed way more than my expectation.The print quality is superb, both in black and white, color copy.The printer is made and designed in such a way that, it uses ink in a very optimal way letting the users print more pages.Easy to use and install the drives. The technical support is also very good I must say.Call the customer support, and they come in no time to get your problem solved.I would like to mention that, always use original EPSON ink as it will increase the life span of the printer and also the print quality will be very good.Use papers with thickness 70 GSM or more to get the best results.Excellent for home, office use. I almost print 1200-1500 prints a month and have no complains with the printer. SO anyone looking for a color printer cum scanner should buy this.I bet, you wont regret buying this printer."
1,"Not even a year of purchase. Already has caused issues twice.Issue:- While printing,paper went back and got jammed. Worst part is yet to come...1) When raised an issue with customer care, the service person thinks that I'm mad and I have done something. He was not ready to accept that it is product defect. Finally convinced him and he had open the printer to remove the jammed paper.2) Issue has arrived again now and paper has got jammed. Eager to see service executive response this time.Moral:- I would suggest not to buy this.Disclaimer:- I'm not a newbie to printer, I had been using cartridge printer before buying this one. I had no issues with that even after 3 years of using and still have no issues with that cartridge printer."
5,"The printer is very good and value for money.I see people dissing on printer they haven't even enjoyed good prints. Well actually I had some very good prints since the start. The process is simple to setup only if you read the instructions. You get drivers easily from epson website and setup is very easy. I also got the printer to work with a CUPS printer server on ubuntu and it seams to do the job just right.Cons:Instructions and Ink filling which takes about a 10 mins to do.Pros:Good output.No Ink head jamming till now even though i don't print very often.Prints well on thick and thin paper.Easy photocopyWorks on LinuxCan be easily shared on network and you can even use your mobile phone connected to network for printing.(Only using another server that runs CUPS Print Server , you can use Raspberry Pie also.)Overall the printer is good and worth its price.Don't focus on those hate reviews they did a lot of things wrong when setting up hence they cannot get the printer working."
4,"It is delivered today. I went through the installation set up looking you tube video as customer support person is not allowed to visit my house due to restriction imposed for outsiders to enter our society premises.The installation process is very smooth and it takes around 10 minutes for ink charging. I installed required printer utility on my Linux and took some print and scan. The picture quality is very good and also same picture quality of photocopies.As per some you tube videos, this printer has very short life span. Usually printer head problem occurs after 1-2 years."
2,"Brought in Dec 2020, worked for six months and then scanner does not connect, same machine, still prints and copies but the scanner, that part cannot connect, even with reinstall, new cable and trying to get a technician here, one visit so far and fix lasted 24 hours. Giving up on this and never again for Epson, as trying to get service is next to impossible, without even discussing warranty, who cares anymore, I just need a scanner printer that works! After six months, I am tossing and going to buy another brand. Happy with printing quality but I need something to last longer than six months! Be very careful before you buy this product or from this brand!"
5,It's a good printer for domestic purpose. Would recommend a duplex printer if one is not willing to do the odd even printing.
1,"The printer was delivered to me on 24th Aug and I called the Epson customer care for installation. Due to Covid, the installation happened a week after and the engineer told me that the parts of this printer are defected and that I must replace it with Amazon. Amazon has a 7 day replacement policy and because this didn‚Äôt get installed on time, they are refusing to take it back. I am left with a brand new printer with defects and will have to get my printer repaired by Epson. Horrible customer service by Amazon. Please think before buying such expensive items from Amazon. It is better to buy from a local supplier for a little more who ensures replacement and service."
4,"The printer is easy to install. The Ink bottles are well designed to fit into the sockets and the ink flows smoothly from them to the printer tanks. The user manual should be a little more revealing, it took me some time to realize that when alternate blinking starts, it would continue for a long time like 10  - 20 minutes.  The black bottle seems to deplete quite fast even in the standard printing mode, I have ordered an additional one and received it the day after. The pages come out fast and also dries fast.  Print quality is adequate. Color calibration is a bit off.  I would report back after using it a while."
5,"I list down the initial setup problems1. After refilling the ink color print was not working.2. After running multiple inbuilt self Head cleaning the color print started coming gradually.3. Still I was seeing missing lines as mentioned in image, then i ran 3 times the head cleaning issue was not resolved.4. I turned off the printer for 8 to 12 hours and kept idle.5. I tried printing again it was printing awesome color prints without issues.If there is a printing issues in new printer it is because of ink flow is taking time, initially I got angry and gave 1 star after running multiple self head cleaning printer is going above and beyondGiving 5 Star for the Delivery and Product"
5,After hunting for 2 days I found Epson L3110 is correct model for my requirement. It's just amazing product. Met all my requirement. Value for money. I skipped choosing WiFi model as it was around 3 to 4k more which I did not find worthy for my use.
2,The printer is good and easy to install only on Windows. Since my Primary machine is Mac I had to return it back. The support team is horrible. Call Centre is worst they can't even speak English and too busy to talk. I ended up teaching Tech Support guys who visited my home teaching the fundamentals of Mac. Tested the features on my Windows it went well. The printer is simple and good but Epson need to work on it's Software and a lot on it's Customer Support hire some good engineers and pay them well.
2,I will list out the problems with this printer1. Photocopy mode is cumbersome and takes a lot of time2. Page edges get smudged in many cases3. You cannot primt multiple pages and sometimes the printer does not print on one side causing a sync issue in case of large amounts of prints.4. The steps to service it is confusing
5,Nice printer it is very easy to instal the drivers and the papper adjecting is some difficult
5,I had reviewed a lot of printers before buying this one and I am not disappointed till now. Got it in Sale and after discount for approx 9500. Good printer for home usage and also for home-office. Only thing is I have not been able to connect the mobile app for printing and unable to figure out how to do it.
4,"I am giving review after using it couple of times. Overall performance is good. Plastic body quality is just ok, could be better. If you are use-to with IT stuff then installation wont be any issue, but if you are not familiar then you should call for installation. Print quality is very good or I would say Awesome and fast too. Does the work for which you are buying it for. A small manufacturing issue I had is that power port is loose and goes inside when I plug in the power cable. But as an IT guy I am use to such issues to fix it so not a big deal for me. But yes if the plastic would better this wont happen I guess. One more thing! don't forget to register product on Epson website for warranty within 14 days of purchase. No one will tell you or remind you to do it. I think that performance wise this is best then other company printers, Also it is an oldest ink tank technology printer company. Don't worry go for it. (I will give another review after 7 month usage and also upload detailed video for installation DIY)"
4,Got a broken Canon printer. Was very disappointed but thankfully had recorded a video during unbox. Immediately initiated a replacement through customer care service. Although had to struggle a bit during replacement but got the right product finally.
1,I have given one rating because within three months we raised 6 service requests to fix the printing issue finally they changed the motor which pulls the ink then it worked properly and Iam still observing it. I am surprised how come brand new product have motor issue.so my suggestion use the printer continuously to test. Now Iam ok but satisfied as prints are coming properly. Still I dint want to change rating. Because I struggled 3 months to fix issue
5,"So Far So Good. neat prints compared to my earlier printer Canon Pixma E470. Both in colour and B/W.Print speed is certainly not as fast as they claim, but decent for home and home office use."
4,"* Nice product, working as expected. 4.5 Stars ***** There as setup time required and it took some extra time, some youtube vedios helped* The user instructions flier (one sheet came with the printer) shall  contain additional information like ""watting time/setup time"" for the calibration of the print head. Got confused as the print head moves left-right with good amount of noise :)"
1,I have purchased the  EPSON L3110 [ Serial No- X6NY3199**] on 31st August 2021.Only 14 days later  it was leter due to BAD & WORST SERVICE & PRODUCTS OF EPSON L3110 its was not working from 14th august. 9pm...I have lunch complaints [100946245*] through voice call at 9am on 16th August But I have received from EPSON customer care attendants  are very poor & chip service..I think Epson L3110 printer is MOST POOR QUALITY  & worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper JAM setting is problem West your money Epson service center  only tried  to  avoidthe  solution..about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this brand
1,Setup was bit tedious but I could do it by following the instructions but while printing it just couldn't print any filetype. I asked for the exchange and again it had same problem. Pls DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. Do go for different brand or higher with laser printer.
1,"Every brand is going downwards for there new ink tank printers,This printer has a big issue in printing photos, it starts printing config page in between printing command printing photos on corner, that wastes time and paper also, dissappointed"
5,"This printer is one of the best printer in this price range which gives us a good quality print of both black & white and colour too. Is installing is also very easy which you can do by your own and also easy to use. In my point of view, this is the best colour printer among others in this price."
5,"Writing this review after using of 2 months of heavy use.I have a small cyber cafe and I use this printer daily regular basis. Best Economical Printer in this budget.I recommend to buy everyone.I have printed more than 400+ pages b/w and ink still remains 70% above+Color print quality is awesome.Amazon Delivery service is also quick, safe and fast. Thanks to seller and Amazon team."
1,"The slowest copy print I ever experienced, it stops and takes 30 sec to print the the second print. Need lots of patience to use thise Epson L3110. performance of the printer is not satisfactory for tree price I paid for.I would rate only 2 stars."
4,It's easy to install and the print quality is best. After using for 2 weeks I am rating the item . Value for money
4,üëå
1,Very bad product
1,Auto cutting not working very bad experience  i also requested for return but they never came
5,"Namaste!Glad to help others by way of sharing experience with this printer. Got it at a discounted price of ‚Çπ12059 (sbi credit card discount). Its installation was very easy and required no much ado. Its operation too, is very easy and convenient. I'm currently using it for printing study materials from mobile only. The performance is really admirable. Initially gave command to print some PDFs of 2 or 3,4 pages and it printed very fast. Afterwards I willingly downloaded brother plugins and mopria print service which also helped me print smoothly but one day when commanded to print PDFs of pages more than 25, it took very considerable time to respond. I was troubled a little bit but soon, I uninstalled all plugins and operated with the help of android printing service itself. It gave wonderful response. Since then, I'm very happily printing my docs.Now come to its printing quality. It yields high quality printing both in color and mono.Time: In my case, black and white print rate is more than 20 ppm (average) while a color photo took me 12 minutes to print.The best thing for me is that this printer does not annoy you by taking too much time in warming up each time you start this. It instantly becomes ready to print ASAP you turn it on. It automatically cleans the heads. Print, scan and copy quality is the best. Moreover, it is manufactured in the Philippines with no equipments from PRC.I don't have experience of printing through laptop or PC, but I say that this is the best printer for printing purpose. If it is functioning very fast even wirelessly, then what about USB connection? Surely, it will not disappoint you.So kindly go for it.Dhanyawad!"
3,"Big drawback is paper feeding tray,If you want take print two sides , we have to open tray every time , that means for 30 papers we have open the paper feeding tray fifteen timesIf we take multiple prints at a time the papers are getting sticking together ( for that reason we have to open the tray every time if you want o print the two sides of paperI have purchased this for to save the time, but it went in vain because of the paper tray, because of opening the paper tray every"
5,"This is a awesome product by Brother. Newly released with best in class features along with WIFI  capabilities. All in one printer with good print, scan and copy quality. Delivery was on time. Very easy self installation and setup process. Connected seamlessly with Mac and iPhone. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase."
4,Great product. Print quality is excellent. Easy to setup and very convenient to print over WiFi. Overall ver satisfied with the purchase.Few things which I expected at this price : - ability to print dual side automatically - baclit LCD display. Its an ordinary lcd and very difficult to read in low light.
5,"Well designed printer, works flawlessly with Mac (AirPrint) over Wifi. Print quality is good. Text prints are very fast and photo prints are slow (as expected with any other inkjet printer).Initial setup was easy as mentioned in the setup guide.Wifi configuration was simple, but typing wifi password using 2 arrow keys was time consuming, this would probably be done faster through the app, but the the app for iPhone didn't work, probably because iOS has several restrictions.Printer support manual duplex printing (both sides), where we need to use manual paper feeder to insert the paper, no need to take out tray for manual duplex printing as it was mentioned in some other review.Tried A4 regular prints and 4 X 6 photo prints. Quality looks good.Photo copy is fun and easy, copying ID card for both front and back is really nice and simple."
5,"You will like everything about this printer.Speed,design, No frequent ink cartridge refill, Inexpensive ink.This looks like hero honda of printers.Fill it>Shut it>>Forget it.At least we have someone to challange HP on the costly ink cartridge they have sold till now."
5,I am writing this after 3 months of using this printer. Ideal for home and small office use. Best in this price range. Wi-Fi printing works fine with laptop and mobile. Mobile scanning is one feature which I found very useful for me (directly scan to mobile and send email or Whatsapp).
2,"Quite impressive features, But seems like quality control is in bad shape, received 2 printer in 4 days, both the printer is having the same problem. After 2-3 mins, It displays ""Cannot Print E3"" and there is no resolution to this problem,Thanks to Amazon, Printer is already returned to amazon."
5,Good printer with average print speed and decent print qualityThe USP of this over a canon /Hp is you can store 100-150 sheets of paper in a tray in the printer so you don‚Äôt have to load pages in a tray at the back every time you have to print. it‚Äôs overall space required to operate is also less. The WiFi connectivity is superb. And the setup was very easy.
1,"In addition to my dics level CD device drivers INSTALLS.Requires,Extra charges for subscription modules and  link of online installation suppot drivers downloads to process printouts.Return and replacement must be extra time upto 30 days.The device as to be runed,tuned and tested.Scanner and printing works well.But features as detailed are few.It doesn't work for bulk,book printing.Ideal for multimedia visiting/Invitations sizes cards.One page at time.Makes awesome.Kindly arrange for replacement for other make printer.As 11th march 2021 is too early to test the device,Also inconveinance of brother supports and customer care.And,11th march 2021 being a general festival holiday.I have regerts in buying this device.Its my sincere request and beg your pardon to replace the BROTHER DCPT540W printer."
5,The printer is excellent when it comes to regular text printing. Borderless Color printing and photo printing is good.printing  is fast and the wireless option makes it even more convenient.The printer can be simultaneously connected to PC and WiFi.Printer is available as ‚Äúairprinter‚Äù in iPhone and network printer in android phones and works without any additional app installation when connected to home WiFi.For scanning app is a must on mobile phone. windows 10 and Linux recognises the printer without any issues.Only inconvenience is with no duplex printing. Manually the printed pages have to reversed and fed along with doing an odd/even page printing.Otherwise great option for home & small office use.
5,This is a very good printer and really good for home use..I was really worried that it might be not good but it changed my mind it's really good.. If you are thinking to buy this printer go for itPhoto quality is good
4,"Do not panic or worry when the installation of the printer is done and you receive e3 error. This means mostly the wifi pcb has been disconnected inside because of the delivery handling(happens in most cases). Register your printer through brother website and raise a complaint. The issue will be resolved in a day or two as the customer service person refixes the pcb. This e3 error will not allow you to connect to wifi. So you need to get this rectified. Compared to the prices and quality of HP, canon, Brother seems to be on the better side. Giving it 4 stars because we were unable to use it immediately after delivery. One would want to use a product immediately after they buy and this wasn't the case. Other than this, you can get this printer with your eyes closed"
2,Manual feed is not working properly.
1,"Actually the product is good, but the piece which was delivered to me was detected. And had some hardware issues in the scanner. Bought it from the seller Appario from West Bengal. Unfortunately that was the last piece, so I wasn't able to get an replacement, instead of that received cashback.I bought so many things from this same seller(banglore).I request to take required action on the distributor ( West Bengal), who wasted my time almost a week on a defected piece.But if you have receive perfectly working piece then you are lucky üòâ."
5,"I liked the printer set up, printer speed and print quality even in color and black and white. I used Wi-Fi printing option. It takes lot of time to spool the print. The color printing option takes a lot of time over WiFi probably again due to spooling of data using Wi-Fi. Overall the performance is satisfactory. I have got good quantity of ink left even after regular use. So I guess the default ink would serve 6 months of 'normal' use or more than that. I still got a spare black ink bottle received during purchase. So probably plenty of time left till black and white print color needs replacement."
5,It is a very nice printer. I bought this printer for printing photos mostly. The printing resolution is very nice as the images are very sharp.Also it is very easy to use as it has wifi. You dont need to connect any extra wires apart from power cable. Juat connect the printer to home wifi and give the print command from any device having the brother app. Also you can adjust and edit the pics to some extent on the apps.Loved it.
5,"Am happy with performance and its a great great printer. Does the job pretty well, setting up is easy. I can now print from my phone, pc and laptop. Did not connect the printer cable as its a network printer. Connect printer to your router and the job is done. Good that i bought this."
3,"The colours are not bright, kinda dim print quality.It's hard to navigate, sometimes you need to change/select an option a lot of times to get the required print.Wifi printing works sometimes, but it is handy, though unpredictable.The screen is hard to see."
1,"New Brand, while setting displays cannot print E3. Google search says it is a mechanical malfunction"
3,"The printer was configured and connected to my mac using wifi very easily.It's very slow, to print 1 normal page takes more than 30 seconds, color it takes at least 1 min.To scan also takes at least 1 min sometimes getting hanged while scanningSo, I will say it's easy to use but sometimes very irritating."
5,"A very nice multifunctional printer with miner paper jam problem towards rear of printer inserting paper without experience. That may be eliminated by enserting in proper manner and with experience.... Overall printer is very  nice... Photo clearity is also  better.... So go with this printer, without any hesitation.... Wait the price at lowest approx 13,398 /- rupees..."
3,"Printer is fine to use. But the black print is not black, it has somewhat greyish shade to it, even on ""Best Quality print"". Connectivity and other things weren't a problem, only print quality is of subpar quality."
4,Nice
5,"Every thing about that printer is very good, its printing is also clear and crisp, Only WiFi setup is horrible when it comes to setup through Brother WiFi Utility application to setup WiFi,  Other wise USB setup is straight forward, am  straggling to configure WiFi through Windows 10 Desktop and WiFi - Router and following all the instructions (like Firewall - Off,  Router SSID , Password) but still I was unable to Configure that Printer.  finally I have to Use Direct WiFi which is also some time slow. otherwise printing and other features like Scanning are good."
5,"This is really a very good printer with all the features like WiFi direct, control panel with display, paper tray, good print quality, good build quality etc. in less budget compared to Epson, canon & hp. You can go for it without any hesitation. Thanks to brother."
5,"This is really a very good printer with all the features like WiFi, wifi direct, control panel with display, dual paper tray can be easily manage for manual dual printing purpose, good print quality mono and colour, Photo printing quality on glossy paper is good.For home use and small business useful features copy,scan and print. Good build quality from bbother at this price range really worth buying. I got it at 12300 including 10% cc discount.You can go for it without any hesitation. Thanks to brother and Amazon.."
4,Build quality us good.Processing speed is too good.Printing speed is normal..The quality of the printer will be fine as long as you use the original ink( applicable on all printers)Overall nice.
5,"One of the best product in this range. I too compared many products. But found this good.Firstly it asked to update the printer, the process to update via app is very simple.And instructions ate simple.Print quality is very good.If you want to take color printout photo, then I would suggedt you to buy kotak photo paper.Rest everythis is good.I too canpare with other brands especially Hp nd erricson.But this is really far far better."
4,"Brother printers is much better than cannon, easy to install. Print quality is super. You get a manual feed slot, integrated paper tray. Easy refill system, and the ink is cheap too. The wireless printing is a lil finicky something otherwise a good product."
5,"Considering the current scenario when we are reluctant in going outside for print outs, this printer serves its job to your utmost satisfaction. Starting from setting up the device to using it, this printer won‚Äôt let you struggle. Please do follow the user manual and you are all set to have printouts. Japan anyways can‚Äôt be beaten in its quality technology."
4,"In general ,happy with the printer for the price and the ink cost ,if Brother could have added ADF (automatic document feeder for  two sided printing ) DCP-T520W should have been the best printer for economical printing  .I think buyers dont mind pay little more  for ADF  feature .Brother do have ADF with other model ,but its only monochrome (no colour) .So brother is one step behind to be the best printer of this range .Hence I rate **** ."
5,Got it for 13.3k. Arrived in 4 days. Opened 5th day. Did not read manuals. Just loaded paper and powered on. The panel told me what to do like fill color etc. Connected to wifi. Installed app on phone. Works flawlessly. Print quality is great.
5,"Ordered in nov'20. There were few reviews about pics getting printed lil dull and darker. But if you process images brighter and lil more saturated you can manage more vibrant prints. From my image you can see all colours have been well developed. Got it for arnd rs.10,500 in  nov'20 and immediately price was reduced to arnd 9,200rs :(.  Anyways very very happy with the end result. Kit also had a 10 film pack, a photo bunting and 10 photo cards. Thank you amazon and the seller!!"
4,Polaroid cameras are better but this works too. It darkens the photos so if you‚Äôre gonna print out then I recommend using brighter photos.
3,"The print quality is very poor. I‚Äôve tried adjusting the exposure, contrast etc on the app but the photos are quite dull. I guess you can‚Äôt expect much from a photo printer for this cost."
1,"It is of no use at all, the picture print quality is not good the photo films are vey expensive (approx 50 rs one film) and the quality does not align with the price. It's an absolutely waste of money in a fancy way. Buy a canon printer at half the price instead."
1,"The film is very small, not as big as they show on video. The picture quality is not up to the mark. Better avoid buying it. Go for larger printer with larger cartridge."
5,Easily the best in this category.
3,The print papers are expensive. Otherwise this is a cool device to have.
4,"Prints are too bright hence color correction needs to be done everytime, needs to adjust brightness to lower level"
1,Not a value for money product charging cable was not there.. if you open cartage flap and close it it will waste one photo paper

1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
1,"I've tried setting this printer up over Wifi and USB cable. Through my Laptop and my smartphone. No matter what you do it won't recognize or detect the printer. It is unusable.Ridiculous for a Rs. 18,999 Printer. Completely useless.Update: Just to give you an idea, to take scans on this printer, it asks you to enable your location (GPS) on your smartphone, and create an account with HP. You have to wonder why. Throughout the setup, it keeps asking for your location. After over an hour of struggle I managed to set it up on my smartphone, but no matter what I do, my laptop cannot use the HP Smart App to connect to this printer regardless of whether I use the Wifi or USB options. If I try to log into the built in web server on the printer, the password I am expected to provide is wrong. This is so ridiculous - because I am connecting to it over USB!!Don't buy this printer! if you must buy one from HP, by a different model. My 10 year old printer works effortlessly, but this is a piece of junk. I didn't have a great impression of HP, but now its hit a new low.Update: part of the problem is there are limited instructions, and some of it is incorrect. This printer says it supports 5Ghz networks but actually it supports only 2.4Ghz. If you are trying to set it up on a 5Ghz network, it will never detect, and won‚Äôt even tell you that is the reason. If setup with the HP app doesn‚Äôt work, just use your built in software. Their app isn‚Äôt needed except for mobile devices,  and I feel they mainly use it to collect data on you üòû"
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"

1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn‚Äôt work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,"I installed the printer today post delivery, realised that the WiFi receptivity is WEAK relative to my earlier printer. Luckily I have 2 WiFi connections at my place, it eventually got connected to the second WiFi Router (the routers are in the next room). The printer has reasonably good Scan and Print quality. This is my preliminary feedback. Will update after few days of working. I have by now tested every feature except FAX in this printer. The SCANs are just beautiful and quite fast. TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY .."
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
3,"Printing quality is good. Printing 2 sides of paper option not able to findScanning feature is not great. When scanning from hp Application on Laptop gives hard time. After  clicking scan button, we need to push paper little bit, how accurate we keep papers before hitting scan button it doesn‚Äôt detect, little move is mandatory after clicking scan button. And scanner is also very slow in scanning papers. Recommend 60% to others."
1,Cartage is too costly.. don't buy
1,Within a month toner low indication. Catridge not available in local market. Original catridge cost around 4.5k. Dont buy. Dont buy. Waste of money
2,"Printer cost is cheap but maintenance cost is higher than other printers. It is not for official purpose , it is used in home for kids project."
1,"Printer cost ‚Çπ17,500. Initial toner was exhausted within 50 print out. New toner is chip type for this model and cost ‚Çπ4500. It's kind of trap from HP to keep chip in Toner. B/W Print/ Xerox  cost ‚Çπ5 per page"
1,"The worst printer that I have ever bought! Right from day 1 issues, service is bad, support is bad. Very truly bad experience. Paper Jam issues, could not print even a single page. Used other printers, never had even a single issue. Don't recommend, stay away from this printer. Utter waste of money, down the drain!"
4,Scanner and all other functions work well. Wifi printing also works well.Duplex printing is not automatic ‚Ä¶ papar needs to be feed again‚Ä¶Paper tray not fully covered. This may cause harm in long run.
3,"Poor build quality. Too much paper jams. I brought it just for the ADF, that works fine. But apart from that the, paper jamming and all its irritating."
5,Not send warranty card
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."
2,HP should have given auto duplex printing in this model. People who are buying beware of it even-though ADF is mentioned in the spec. Such a basic feature is not available.
5,Product is good quality no doubt but some time I face the problem to connect with wifi.
5,Excellent
3,"It does not have automatic duplex as claimed on Amazon site. Also its all features like booklet printing, two sided printing, customised page printing cannot be availed on Mac. Air print just offers basic printing"
1,Please do not buy this printer.  Because when the toner is completely exhausted you have to buy a new one.  Toner is expensive.  This toner is fitted with a chip. New toner is not available in the market to buy
1,I bought a new one but still the printer is printing half prints and tearing the pages I also clean the cartridge several times but still is not working well I bought a month ago hardly I printed 10pages yet
1,Worst printer please don't take
1,The printer doesn't scan its cartridge and giving the same error again and again.This is the condition of a new printer. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,I did not get it my USB cable and all with printerOnly power cable i got it
3,"Total prints done :black: 472color: 93ink levels decrease by :black :10% of 135mlcyan: 13.33% of 75mlyellow: 17.77%  ""magenta: 15.55%  ""canon claims :full black tank yield is 6000 pagesfull color tanks combine yield is 7000 pagesfrom my usage the claims by companies are always garbage.Color yield is bad.The above tests were done with 25% ink saving enabled in Acrobat reader."
4,"Bought during the sale, if you own or plan to buy macOS product, stay AWAY from this model. The ridiculous strategy of Canon to NOT offer macOS support for a new model is why you shouldn't buy this model."
1,"The ink in either of the 3 pipes (C,M,Y) periodically stops reaching the print head and that color would stop appearing on color prints, making them discolored due to absence of one color. Then to correct this problem you either call the customer service or yourself run ""Ink Flush"", either option wastes hell lot of ink. Almost 10-20% of all ink is wasted in one ""ink flush"" run. Similarly, the customer care representative would also waste similar amount of ink but he would claim that he did his best by using injections and not running ink flush.In my 20 day usage, this problem has already occured twice, wasting almost 30% percent of the color inks. Its such a disappointment.Customer care is of no help as they come and waste your own ink.Regarding print quality and ink consumption on prints, it is fine."
4,"Writing this after 8 months of rigorous use and aprox (7000 page) printed till date and usage (Home/personal use).So, you I'll get around 3000 pages of black& white print and 1000 pages of colour print with one set of ink Bottels.Cost of original ink is 450rs per bottle of Each colour (C/M/Y/B)Print quality is amazing... I'm sure you I'll not disappoint...But This can't beat Laser printers.Cons:-(Only one)üòÅ1>It is a little bit noisy during general mode printing(Fast Printing) but can be Switched to silent mode(you I'll get slow printing speed).So at last it is must buy product..Go for Itüòâ"
1,"I bought this product because I needed a printer for home and this was Amazon choice and had ink fill option. When it arrived, the carton said it was not compatible with Mac OS. I was surprised and filed for a return at which point the Amazon customer service person said, 'As per policy, we can't return this'. I reasoned that it does not mention on your website that this is incompatible with MacOS and since this purchase was made due to incomplete or misleading information, Amazon should either replace with a MacOS printer or a refund my money. But he threw policy at me and said, we can't do anything! Now, I'm left holding a big brick in my  hands!"
5,"One of the best printer available at your budget. Super easy to install, good quality prints and descent speed of prints. At this price it's tough to get a better option. Only problem is it makes lots of robotic noises while you operate it. Khatak khutuk multiple times. I suppose that's how it's supposed to be working. If u wish to use black and white prints than this can easily give you one print at about 20-30 Paisa ."
5,It's okcolor print quality average ( glossy and normal paper)not perfectly good  butit's ok for pre installed CISS Ink Tank SystemOverall average quality printer not be good
5,I got the printer delivered today... The setup is a bit of a hassle... But once u get it running... The print quality is soo good and crisp... I would recommend using original inks with it... The only downside is that the printer is a bit too noisy...
4,"Over all it serves the purpose very well.I have been using it for more than 6 months for personal use at home.It's for quality n affordable printing.Can't call it a slim printer as size is larger than Epson L130, as it seems.Preferred this one because it's Canon brand.After more than year use: If you have routine printing requirement (weely/daily) then only prefer ink tank printers Or else go for lasers. If these printers stay ideal for more than 10-15days often then ink tubes will dry and cause heavy ink usage.So, ink tanks are not for occasional printing requirements."
5,"This is a wonderful printer and the print quality is very good! The printing speed of black&white printing is just like a laser printer. As this printer uses black pigment ink, the print quality of documents is very rich and clear. Color printing is bit slow but the quality is excellent and on photo paper the color prints are vivid and rich in color.CANON IS BEST FOR PRINTING AND IMAGING PRODUCTS!!!"
4,Good. But picture quality can be improved.Further add to specifications that it is compatible only with Windows 7 SP1.I had to suffer a lot due to this.
3,"The printer is working fine. Print quality is above average but not superb. All photos are showing yellowish toned. I couldn't correct. Scope is not there i think. Most surprising is company have mentioned 7000 pages print per full ink loading. But thats quite absurd. It will give 100 A4 page print what i am observing after printing 25 pages.One more thing. Amazon is selling the printer but original canon ink is not available with Amazon. You are dealing in duplicate/ compatible lower quality ink only. Customer Review is telling that. If any of your seller is selling original Canon GI 790 ink, kindly let me know."
2,Print quality after few months goes vary bad. I am using it for few pages per day for school projects/assignments. after 2-3 months nozzle clogging becomes daily affair and now i have to perform deep cleaning almost on daily basis. Ink consumption is fine (with nearly 500 pages printed only 20% is used).
5,"Change is good, till date i believe on epson but now i switch canon, believe me its not disappoint you, very good picture quality, just take care about cartage installation, compare to epson l130 its much better.printing little bit slow but not much matter. just go for it."
5,"Got it checked and installed by canon person for warranty, he came in 2 days. 1-Oct being holiday. Bangalore.Main purpose is to print kid worksheets and exercises. Since I have pc and laptop, didn‚Äôt went for wifi models and saved few thousand. Its simple plug and play, just Download latest driver from canon site and its good to go.On purchasing printer I bought extra inks for 423/- per bottle. ( it comes with ink)Print quality is good quality, b/w and color both. Took couple of them.Don‚Äôt need scanner, I use Microsoft office lens app for scanning documents/cards. iPhone camera is better üôÇI got better deal on amazon then Offline stores 9100 (printer + additional 1black, 3 colour ink) + saved time"
5,"this printer is fully efficient and fast, i tried to print family photo for in house and was amazed with quality.... just wow and with  black and white print is fast as rabbit."
4,"Print quality is excellent even comparable to lab quality I would say...Have taken about 30 4x6 photo prints on day 1 and all have come out great. Colours look vivid and details are sharp using glossy photo paper (fullcolors brand).Have attached a shot of few of the photosInk filling was easy enough. Ran the alignment test right away after setup and made the adjustments before printing stuff.Got this instead of the Epson L130 because of the removable print heads which should be helpful in case of future trouble.So far so good lets see, If it is lasts 4-5 years trouble free it would be superb value for money."
5,Product is too good i satisfy product easy installed black and white print so good and coloure print good not to best ink ificiant product but all in one print sujjest low cast printer but All In One Best
3,"Hello..... I'm Aakash ....I bought this printer 1 month ago approx........now on first day when I filled up ink then ink level dropp....dont know without printing any page ....so that's not a big problem now after 1 months ....... It's ink decreased at 1 level 25 percent even I rarely use colourful printing.....I have taken out 1,2 pages only ....and now .....this happens ....and decreasing day by day ......üë∫üòàüëø I'm a student and print regularly this happens then ....I am very disappointed ...help support.....resolve this at the earliest .....this is I think worst experience ever happen with me ......"
4,"The printing speed is pretty slow. I've taken around 100 prints so far,  the black ink level still looks to be full.  Magenta colour has dropped quite a bit for some reason, even though I haven't taken that many colour prints, with only 1 or 2 in high definition.The picture quality isn't great, but it's good enough."
4,"PRINT QUALITY IS GOOD. I FEEL THE COLOUR PRINT IS LIGHTER IN CASE OF STANDARD MODE ESPECIALLY THE PINK AND VIOLET THAN WHAT IT IS DISPLAYED IN THE COMPUTER. THAT COULD BE DUE TO THE INK DIFFERNCE. I HAVE USED EPSON L 355, AND SO I COULD COMPARE THE QUALITY OF THE COLOURS. OTHER MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IS THE REMOVABLE PRINT HEAD-CATRIDGE TYPE , WHICH IN FUTURE WE NEED NOT GO TO A SERVICE CENTRE TO REPLACE IT. WE COULD DO IT OURSELF. REPLACING THE PRINT HEAD OR CLEANING IT IS REALLY CUMBERSOME IN CASE OF EPSON. OVERALL IT IS A FANTSTIC PRODUCT AND VALUE FOR MONEY. EXCELLENT BUY."
2,This doesn't work with Mac.. and yet it comes recommend by Amazon without calling out the fact that one of major operating system is not supported by the printer.. even canon site has this information in detailed specifications and not called out loud.
5,"Nice overall printerHowever, color prints fade over time. ,Canon needs to work on this.Budget thing. Good for small projects. Home use. Small office use. No scanner here so get a dedicated scanner and be blessed. Better than HP as compared to after sales service and speed. Choose this over HP . Best thing is that even if you wear off the heads, they are replaceable and please use Original Canon ink which should be bought from store."
4,"I bought it as a stand by printer for my office as my existing HP laser printer had some issue and was not able to get it sorted out. For offices, i still would recommend the wifi verson of the same. Overall, no complaints as far as ease of printing and affordability. The print quality could have been better."
5,"Working perfectly in windows PC,Package include- Printer, Cartridge, Ink (CMYK), Cables(USB,POWR), Manual and Driver CDPrint quality is goodPrinting Speed is averageVery hard to find driver in linux, if you are using for a windows PC/Laptop its easy it install driver"
5,"See i purchased this canon G1010 for home use and it is the best for it. If you really want a single function printer on which you can rely, this is that. See printing differs as you change the mode of printing and canon also gives you free ink bottles to you so actually the printer only costs you between Rs.5500-6000 and the product support is excellent.It may not have the scan and print facility as the all in one printers has but you can use Adobe Scan for a much better AI powered scans. It also have the feature of manual duplex printing. One of the best features I liked in it that you can print via your smartphones also using USB mode in printhand, bolo print or print share like apps....Actually I really liked this printer as it really valued my money...."
5,Works very nicely for black and white... colour takes a little time...and quality is a little faded...maybe becuause I kept the settings on low or something...didn't check actually as mostly I use it for black and white...very apt product for black and white printing.worth every penny.
5,Got it yesterday and photo print is studio quality. Even the text print is crisp.
5,Value for money. Ink tank. Why need all in one when the mobile can scan.
5,Very good print quality. The ink tank can save money over a period of time. Suitable for digital studio.
5,Paper delivery is smoothPrint quality is very sharp( Sharpness depends upon the gsm and type of paper)Double side printing optionEconomicalFirst free bottles will give you less prints around 4000 black prints.. but after refilling with second bottles 7000 prints can be achieved
5,Best product for home its more than 2 years and it is working fine till now just refill ink once in two years . next time i will order  canon printer with scanner  if you have budget then go for canon  inktank printer all in one. I have used inkjet printer in the past and they are very costly for home like replacing cartidages is a headache which prints only 60 80 pages.
1,"I seldom used the printer for hardly around 100 prints. The printer upon 1 year usage has stopped printing. I have 3/4th of black ink tank still available with black ink however, the prints are not coming out properly. Do not buy this!"
5,A no brainer for those who are looking for a good quality printer for home use at a affordable price.. Everything about it is excellent.. Very good performance with quality printing.. Value for money in short if wanna say
5,"Love this product. Because it is an ink tank, it consumed very little ink while printing. The installation and operation are very easy too. The print quality is great too. I've had to get it repaired just once in the last couple of years that I have been using the product.Highly recommend it."
4,Due to low use it head blocked if regular uses then no problems.In inject printer in Budget it's ok.If you left it for few days with use it not work but when you clean by Canon software it work again.
5,I've wanted an ink reservoir printer for a long time. I bought this and am so pleased with the quality of it and the printing. It comes with a full set of ink bottles. Great value printing
5,"I have used more than 5 printers. Brother 500 w, Epson 110, Brother 2541 dw, Hp 1020. All have their pros and cons. But this is far superior print quality like laser. Fantabulous."
5,It prints pvc card that's why I m so happy.
5,"Easy to use, and good quality. Only complaint is that ink is getting depleted very quickly. Definitely the ink will not last half of the claimed time"
1,"The product came quickly as expected but had missing bartender software pen drive without which its difficult to use printer.The shipper has marked brand as ""F2C"" but you will get as brand as ""xprinte"" which is made in china .This will also have issue while returning it back ."
5,"This product is too much easy to installation and it can be used in Windows 7,XP. And its printing quality is too much clear and it is working too much smoothly."

5,"1. Very good build quality 2. Print quality is very good 3. Direct WiFi connection is available 4. Need to enable the connection to other WiFi network. Please see the help page for this. 5. For the first time, the mobile device will not get connected by QR scan. You need to enter the password manually. After that, it will get connected automatically. 6. Only A4 size is able to print 7. USB and Power cord cable length is sufficient."
5,"I purchased this product thru AMAZON today 02/10/2019 and they delivered the product well before time as mentioned.  Packaging was excellent and all the accessories mentioned was available.Regarding installation it is very straight forward and easy to do as well.WIFI works very well.  No duplex printing.  Only printer no photocopier and scanner.  But as on today worth for money for which i have given.  I did some test prints around 20 pages it has come out very good and faster as well.  Need to wait and watch how the performance will be on further usage.Only one clarification required is ""I feel it produces lot of heat"".  Can anyone confirm if this is usual.  I used it  for more than 1 hour and i feel the heat is very high.  Can someone clarify the heating element alone.M. SethumadhavanBangalore"
5,"Excellent print quality, option of printing in 600 or 1200 DPI. use 600 DPI to save toner and also get very sharp fonts. I also use this for envelope printing and it does the job very well. I ordered the 1600 page 211KEV cartridge along with the printer. I have not used the starter cartridge at all. This device is highly recommended for print only jobs."
3,"I was very excited to order a laser printer however the price is the same during the great festive season.We are having very moderate use of printer, after using for few months started giving issues with WiFi connectivity so we have to switch to a USB wire mode. Secondly paper is often gets  jammed.Overall, it is a good laser printer however don't expect the wifi to be available all the time. We have not refilled the toner cartridge so can't say anything much.I hope the manufacturer would help in resolving the wifi connectivity issue as it was one of the influence factor to purchase the product.Thanks."
4,It's a nice product...initially I was very hostile to its quality because many instructions were in Chinese and I could not understand the initial setup...however the customer support helped me very well and it's a nice product as far as its cost is concerned
5,"One of the best budget printer. I have used the same model printer in UK. It was amazing with wifi. I almost printed more than 1000 pages with initial toner. Unfortunately we are not allowed to carry one. So happy that i found the same here with cheaper price. Small tip- don‚Äôt print toomuch at one stretch. U may feel heat and slight smoky kind. Notvto be afraid of, u need hold or wait for few minutes n start again. Worth for personal use. But i used more than that. Hope this is also gonna do good for me. So far so good"
5,"1)Well packaged, delivered 1 day before schedule (2)Easy to intall. (3)Print quality good say 4.5/5 (4)App can be downloaded on phone to use from mobile. Press WiFi button to print and scan the qr code on your mobile (5)Power button on rear(6) Setting of 600/1200 dpi to save cartridge (7) Manual duplex printing possible(8) Body plastic is of good quality (9)Value for money."

1,"Don't buy it, it's purely Chinese product & not only this. Current is coming in whole body just after installing the brand new printer. Howcan someone cheat like that... atleast it maybe acceptable & believable if it happens after one month or later but in brand new printer if problem is coming then this is definitely a serious concern & compromise with quality."
5,Installed in few minutes through Pantum mobile app. Printed few pages via mobile and it is decent. Very convenient to print via mobile. Great printer.
1,"Dear All,Getting used product without all accessories from VE- Store (Vendor). Outer packaging was very well but inner product was not working and used one as no seal was there. I damn sure it was used. Kill my and his time very disappointed from VE-Store."

4,Print speed and quality very good WiFi works good using my brother phone but my phone was not connected with WiFi
5,Good easy to use Printer. Mobile app may be made a little more user friendly
4,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP.  Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with.  I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.On your printer, press Menu button and :1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
4,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back) Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.About the product ->Pros:1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.Cons:1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache6. Noisy7.  No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.Verdict ->  If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor service from brother i purchase it before a month & i only 33 page print problem comes and 1 time motherboard changed but again problem come and no one listen even i call customer care but only delay delay delay from there sides
1,I am an advocate by profession - this printer is not meant for advocates who requires to print pages on both the sides only on legal size papers. This is useless for me now. I am ready to sell it for half rate and the product is in warranty.
5,It's Awesome.This Multifunction Printer is superb for Professionals. Printing speed and quality is really awesome and all other features add cherry on the cake.Packing of the product was fantabulous. Really well pracked with all sort of precautions taken.
5,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
4,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months.  The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.Rating: 5/5.[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
1,"U can't use without problem, regular problemsDefectives: adf reader stucks, line come on print out page, images come black, repair man from company can't solve problemAdvantages: super connecting WiFi, scan is good , customer care giving good service"
5,"Everything good except wifi direct printing from mobile.All type of printing and coping features works wellTakes 10-15 seconds while startup and then prints very fast.Bought only 10 days before so cant say about durability.Brother iprint &scan app on android is very very slow to work with while printing.I used many hp deskjets and inktank printers, all gave me mental tortures time to time  but this printer looks like my real friend i was looking for."
5,"Awesome quality printer under 16 to 17 k.. Best product from brother. I use various printer from various company,but this one is the best.. Thanks amazon and brother"
5,We are using this totally good. Compare with other brands it's 90 present dust free.
1,Performance very bad! Lines appearing while scanning & paper getting stuck after just two to three Printouts! Waste of time & money!Pls send your experienced engineer to set it up properly this Sun 10th June!
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor product. i purchase it before a month and motherboard changed(Installed  DCP-L2540DW instead of DCP-L2541DW)..Its Very big lie..
1,Video Player is loading.
5,This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues.
5,"I would like to assure everyone, who are thinking to purchasing this printer. This is one of the best printer, that could be available at this price range, in the category of monochrome. All the other brands in monochrome printers, have all the fancy features but they are not robust. The cartridge they use is a chip based and offers less print than the claims made. And additional, if the chip gets a problem, you spend extra to get it repaired. And they make printers in such a fashion, that they are dated in some years, so that you buy another one. Brother printer offers you robust printing, scanning, photocopying with auto duplex. Per print cost comes about 0.19 Indian Paisa. They have bit slow services but a reliable one. This printer lasts so longer, with minimal expenses. Worth buying for office, personal, academic purposes."
4,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It‚Äôs a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
5,Excellent Printer from Brothr with useful functions
4,"Firstly, since I was confused, this printer can handle legal size paper- print, copy and scan.Easy to set up the printer. Wireless is a bit tough to set, but once you're done, it works perfectly. Prints are great including the ones on Legal Size Paper. Scanning could have been faster, but can't complain much at this price. Photocopy is absolutely hassle free. ADF works great. I'll update the review after exhausting the first cartridge."
3,"The print quality is about average, when compred to a simple HP 1020 printer.The speed of copying is very fast - photocopy is great. The speed when printing over wifi from iphone is slow, however from macbook or pc is as fast as usb (almost).Looks like its heavy duty stuff. The auto document feeder works flawlessly so far.The screen is dot matrix. I was expecting a more user friendly coloured lcd screen , like you get on inket brother printers. The options are hard to get and toggle with as its like a calculator screen which is outdated.So i like it , it does the job, and is sturdy. It also has a good deal of storage for sheets , so u dont have to refill paper too often."
4,In with WiFi connecting my model is DCP L-2541DW..but it showing in display DCP L- 2540...Pls.clarify this..and there is no hologram to check the item whether it is zenune product or not....and one hook is not fitted correctly.... Pls give clarity... Item arrived in time...good service....
1,"Worse after sale service by Amazon,seller ,brand.Installation specifically written free of cost still brand ( brother) charging 500+ gst for installation n demo.Inspite complaints to Amazon n seller Neither of two concern about it. Amazon wants we to make complaints , writing mails instead self action.if owner of Amazon is viewing this my review please get into it on property to avoid negative publicity of Amazon.This is my last purchase from Amazon.Thanks..."
5,At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free.
5,"Best printer. Much better than hp or samsung. There is no other feature left  other than color printing which a printer can have. It has adf, wireless printing and scanning that works flawlessly, copying and print speed is the best at 30ppm. Very easy to use nad setup. It has a very good range of wifi connectivity.  Got it for just rs.12000 in amazon great india festival."
1,"The photocopy machine (Brother DCP-L2541DW) which we have purchased from Amazon India, that said machine is damaged and poor quality."
3,"Print quality is nice but have to face lot of jerks for the installation. Setting up of port via switching on both Wifi button on the printer and WPS button on the router doesn't work and had to install through brother support. Moreover, if would need a copy of one side and two sides, the process is herculine and not automatic where I felt a lot of pain."
5,"Amazing Japanese build quality. Easy to set up and use with minimalistic buttons. Its a black and white printer and does its job well. As long as you do not have children with heavy art project requirements, then then this is the perfect home home office printer for a working professional."
1,"Earlier I gave a good review of the product but I was proven completely wrong. Printer needed service 3 times in 6 months for the same problem. Service engineer attended every time promptly, opened up the printer, scraped a few electronic points using a screwdriver and got it working. After the last service, there was no go. it still does not work and is in warranty. More so, Brother India senior management does not respond to emails nor do they take action. Avoidable, that all I would say."
3,"It s a reasonably decent multifunctional printer and operates alright. However, do not buy if you want to connect wirelessly. The wireless network configuration and the connectivity are very unreliable and do not work for more than a few hours. You will have to repeatedly reconfigure the network configuration by selecting your Wifi Network SSID and entering the password/key using a hard to use interface."
5,"Great quality prints and very efficient system overall. If I get this on a discount, iTunes completely worth the purchase. I've been a HP user for many years, and I was fed up or changing printers and paying for expensive cartridges. Brother does a great job overall. I may update my review after one year of use. So far it has heen working really smooth."
1,"don't buy this printer there have some technical issue like1, when we use refile cartage printer showing replace toner anytime on display and PC too where printer setup software installed.2, printer going on sleep mode after 1 hour,  and if printer in sleep mode printer not taking command for printing and scanning too after rebooting you can use again3, Cheques printing mode not in this printer, you can't print cheques4, technical service support also not good.5, You can't use Refiled cartage with in Warranty period. if you used refilled cartage Brother not give you service free service relented printing quality issue."
3,I have a 4 year old HP LASERJET. I use generic ink/toner cartridge for the laser printer. Those last me a month or two with hundreds of pages. The Brother does not last that long. The ink of the hp 126nw lasts very long in comparison. I will update on other benefits of this printer in due course.
2,Well they advertise it as with wi fi printer but it's wi fi capabily hardly work. It rarely can work flawlessly on wi fi. Installing driver using wi fi is a hit or miss. Mobile app is DAMN slow and impossible to our practically.Please note that I am absolutely comfortable with setting up technical stuffs and I do understand how such devices work.
1,"After installing this printer, my Modem now only allows one device at a time to connect to wifi broadband.Earlier it used to allow multiple devices to connect.Otherwise there is no issue with this printer. It can be a bit slow in copying data over wireless from mobile but that is not an issue for me"
5,"I am glad that I made this choice. Amazing printer and has everything you would need. Nolonger required to run around stationary shops for print, scan or copy. Installed within minutes with no hassels. Does the job flawlessly, and liked the wireless mobile printing, scanning. Also the ADF feature is great."
5,It's a good printer for daily uses at home or office . I like the duplex technology for which I basically bought this. Connected easily with wifi. And last but not the least the customer service is also good as I was facing the difficulty in connecting with wifi they helped me swiftly to resolve the problem.
4,"I have been using this printer for 3 months, The print quality is awesome sometimes papers stuck for 1 sided prints but except that issue I didn't feel any bad thing about this product,I thought it would acan legal size papers but it doesn't, overall good product ."
5,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
4,A bulky printer. The toner last for about 1600 prints only. And a replacement cost RS 3500/- Quite expensive. After sales service is poor. They are not prompt and take their own time to resolve the issues.
5,I loved this printer because of these features1. Easy installation2. Works with all versions of windows3. Good printing quality4. Good printing speed5. Very low noise6. Thermal printing is cost effective
4,Printing text not good enough. Image printing is fairly good.
4,The product is great and easy to use. Picture quality is better than the long text. Super handy.With multiple templates and editing options for the pictures makes it even more convenient to use.
1,Don't buy... I have placed return too... The print quality is not at all good... Can see what's printed.. poor dpi assemblage... Don't buy you will regret.. look for something better if you really want to invest in a pocket printer
4,Good productBut I get wrong colour the product
5,Excellent I like it very much
1,Very very bad picture quality. Do not think of buying this.
1,"It's the worst printer to buy, one of my friend had bought it, and the picture will go within two days, how can someone use this printer for journaling, it's the wattage of money, don't buy it, pictures will face away in two days , u will totally get a blank sheet , no body will tell this that pictures used to fade away"
5,"This is a very nice, tiny and compact printer, light weight and portable.Quality is also good. It is value for money."
5,The quality the product is really good. And the print is also very good. No need for any printer cartridge as it is thermal. Easy maintenance and easy to replace the papers. No overheating issue.
5,It is very good product....I really very happy purchase this product...its products quality are amazing and very good quality products...I purchase this product my money is valuable to us...I really like this product..it's products are very helpful to us and very good working ....I used this product my work is easy removed.... thanks to Amazon...

5,Very good product.colour print is bit costly..easy to use.easy to print from mobile app.good quality print .suitable for homes and print less than 70-100 pages in a month
4,Photo is somewhat blurr but it's ok üëå
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
4,Photo is somewhat blurr but it's ok üëå
4,"First of all my usage is moderate and for home use only, hence opted for this.The printer is very light in weight and all the three functions are operating smoothly.The only concern is the ink duration, yet to check on that, but I'm pretty sure that it could be managed economically by filling the ink manually but have to compromise a bit on the print quality especially colour print.Further I would update this review after a month or two regarding the ink duration, refills and other things if any.Update: I am a light user and the ink lasted for more than 4 and a half months. It printed more number of pages than what has been mentioned in the description. All three functions r still working properly, there r no issues whatsoever.I would recommend this product for normal home use."
3,fully damaged product
1,"Received a damaged product... showing error code in detecting USB.. requested replacement,for which I hv to ship the item through post.. really horrible experience"
5,"Review after 1 week of use: I chose this particular model over MG series because of high capacity, low cost cartridge(pg47 yield claimed : 400 pages; claimed cost: 1.6 rs/page). Using in home, i printed 30-40 pages without any issue in the first week. black and white printing is best and moreover i am using ""draft mode"" in b/w whenever possible to save ink and to make it cost as low as 1 rs/page. color printing quality is also very good keeping in mind the price tag(around 4k when i bought).There were main two fears while buying: whether or not product is strong enough(in this price range all printers are cheap and not rock solid) and packaging is good enough so that it is not damaged and whether or not it is defective and whether they give genuine cartridges with it.in my case, luckily, no damage, no defects as of now, and genuine cartridges were sent. I strongly recommend to buy from **reputed, trusted, amazon fulfilled seller** to get rid of these fears.next review update: after 3 months."
3,PRODUCT BUILD QUALITY GOOD BUT INK FINISHIED IN ONLY 3 DAYS. ITS ALMOST 30 PAGES COLOUR & 50 PAGES BLACK.
5,"Very very good product by Canon.. I like itEasy copy, scanning etc.. All good features. I highly recommend this product.."
1,Scanning unit is dysfunctional. I've eagerly waited for a week & my excitement was blown.To make matters worse my pick up has been initiated by Amazon but I've yet to receive the person for my return.I've been a faithful customer but now I question my judgement. I'll change my review once I get the requisite services from the dealer & Amazon. Pathetic to say the least.
1,I have not got tat bagon tat box they have entered free bag
4,"Print quality is ok, not so good but it is okVery easy to installBut when I switched on the printer it takes time to ready, once it ready it is good to go, no problem"
1,Amazon not returning printer as it's not compatible with office pcs.
5,good working
2,No wifi...wifi model is just 200 more..bought this by mistake..
1,"Not good cost print and  not valuableThis printer is costly and printout are faid and not clearThis printer is not for daily,office,home or not other use"
4,Nice product if u have less work to done with it
4,Installation is somewhat time taking but overall print quality is very good. I'm little bit worried about ink consumption.Quite happy with this. Thank you Amazon!

1,"Epson Seiko is a Japanese company known for their excellent quality. I used to have HP printers earlier but found these are not good. I switched over to Epson printers recently. I have two Epson printers. One is L-4150 Ink Tank Colour Printer and another is M-1100 printer which is a black and white printer. The print quality of both of them is superb and cost of one print is very low. I have been using both the printers for some time and have not found any problem. The After Sales Service of Epson is good. I strongly recommend if one wants to buy ink tank printers, then go for Epson. I have iMac which has no CD drive. I just downloaded drivers for M-1100 from the Epson web site and immediately started using the printer. It is noise less and has no frills. Cost is very affordable. But it can handle only A-4 size paper. Epson sends their service engineer if you want his service for installation. It is a free service."
5,Excellent delivery. Working is awesome.
1,Faulty and Used product was delivered to us. The product did not even contained the same serial number as mentioned in the invoice.Processing of return is very slow and is still going on without any clarification.
3,Ink filling it's very slowly this model. Ink level not clear to viewable. But print out quality super.
5,Don't think too much just buy it you will not regret it
3,DVD not working facing a lot of problems to install & connect with desktop.
5,Good product. Easy to fix paper jams.
5,Perfect monofonctional printer.
5,ok
1,Poor quality
5,"Speed, Print quality, Efficiency which i was looking 4 nd fortunately I got this printer. Its value 4 money, cost effective, fast, easy to setup and can be used directly through smartphone without any hustle üëçAnd the paper tray is one of the best feature of this model which provides Efficiency and time saving where we can store 150 pages at a single go. After reviewing side by side to various other models of different brand, finally purchased it üôåüëç Happy with the prod and most importantly its a new model launched in d 2nd half of the 20k so üëå  üòÄ  this is d plus point too. Instead of purchasing any old model of 2019 or 18Just go 4 it.."
4,"Works well. May not be as bright as a hp ink jet. No issues. Takes a while to get used to. Online videos are helpful. Looks like online availability of genuine ink is a problem.  Brother does provide local city contacts to buy genuine ink. And it‚Äôs available at discount. Print speed is fast. It does not have duplex printing. USB and WiFi printing works well. Overall very satisfied. 1st ink tank purchase after reviewing hp, canon, Eason. This had the least concerns. My previous hp inkjet ink is no longer in stock. So hp was last choice for a new printer."
5,"Received the product on time. The printer seems to be decent for the price. The colour prints on this printer also seems to be good, but not excellent, overall the printer does it's job fairly without any problems. Go for this printer if you want a compact printer with all features and plus it's wireless as well, I would suggest everyone to go for this rather than going for hp,Canon or Epson. This brand seems to be new in India but is definitely worth every penny spent."
2,"Update After using 3 months:Prints fast (b/w), color printing is also great. Can print using wi-fi. BUT the color prints on photo paper seem to be fading quite badly over time. Making this unusable. I have tried 3-4 different brand papers. Brother paper is not available. I do not know where the issue is.Reduced rating to 2. As I can get a much cheaper laser printer for b/w prints. Attached images are without any filters. The browns were blacks when printed.Below is my original review:This is the best printer I have bought in recent times. Prints quite fast and cheap (going by numbers, haven't used a complete ink set yet). Wireless from any device.Special mention: Borderless printing. Try printing on a photo paper (with borderless setting) and you will get amazing pictures printed at home. Attached image is on A4 sheet. Loved it."
5,"It took me 2 weeks to carefully analyze every printer. Then ended up with this one.It is a new model. I bought it for 12300. It it is 300rs less. Just grab it as soon as you can.It is worth it.Once you buy it, carefully read their guide manual of 6 steps. I missed 1 step in the beginning and struggled but now it is very easy to use. Even a kid can monitor it.Let me know if anyone has any doubt."
4,"1) Not compatible with Mac OS, you will have to use Brother iPrint&Scan app for wireless print.2) you can only print PDF format through IPrint&Scan app in MAC.Mac user should avoid and purchase DCP-T510W which has apple airprint.Windows users go for it, great product!"
5,"the printer released in nov 2020proshas the latest tech like speedpaper tray  can take even legal size papersmanual feed for 1 paper auto head cleaning when connected to a power source. i feel the auto head clean is a great feature for an intank printer to ensure the printer head remains clean. my last printer Epson L 210 did not have the feature resulting in few clogged nozzles of the printer head with no repairs but change of printer head for rs 4500/In this printer manual duplex is easy. You can set the paper tray to legal and easily reinsert  A4 sheets for duplex printing.you can  use the manual feed too.ConsBrother is not so popular brand as yet in India as compared to Epson , canon, HPVerdictGo for it if for all your needs. The best All in one printer available today"
1,"Inaccurate description of this product from the seller. A trusted seller should be more careful. I buy a lot of stuff from this seller. But the first time this has been a problem. Trusting their description that the device supports iOS and MacOS products, I got this printer. It did not work with Apple products. When I found out from the website of the manufacturing company that it doesn‚Äôt have any drivers for Apple products and that I have to use an app which will just print pdf and pictures that too only via AirPrint, I tried to return the product as it was useless for me since I use only Apple products. So this expensive printer is just a waste of money for me. Did not expect this from this premium seller."
5,"Ordered this printer after a lot of comparisons with other printers in similar range.My requirement was to have wireless printing for enabling through multiple devices. I was trying to order DCP-T520W which has few more features than this (extra RAM, LCD display, copy zoom in/out) but it was not available at that time so I went for this. You can compare both at Brothers website as well. If you donot need those extra features then no need to spend extra 1000 rs.Print quality is good. The quality depends a lot on paper quality too, so if you have to print a color intensive page then use high quality paper.Scan resolution is better than other machines in the same range.I had issue with WIFI setup. The device was going to sleep (disconnected) after 5 minutes and was hard for mobile/laptop to discover the device. But I upgraded the printer firmware and the router firmware and now working like a charm.The manual feed is also working as required. If there is paper in manual feed then it will be used first, then from tray. There is no need to remove the tray (as mentioned in some other review) for printing on manual feed."
3,"Pros: Cost per page printing is very low - I have printed around 1000 pages so far but ink level has hardly reduced.Cons:1) Printing via wi-fi is amazing slow - after print command it takes 2-3 minutes to start printing.2) Mobile app is worst for i phone. YOU CANT PRINT WEB PAGES OR EMAILS.  YOU CAN PRINT ONLY WORD AND PDF THROUGH TERRIBLE TIME CONSUMING PROCESS. First save word or pdf file on mobile, then you need to open printing app of brother, then open the file from the app and then only you can fire print command.I am selling this at half price - anyone in mumbai wants to buy let me know"
4,"I purchased this printer recently after a lot of research. And I am satisfied with my purchase.Pros: quality of photos are excellent. Wi-Fi is working although not smoothly, and you can connect with multiple devices. But all of them should be using the same Wi-Fi. I was initially printing on 70 GSM A4 papers all my color photos, and they were looking good. But when I used glossy A4 they were mind-blowing. Customer support is also good. I struggled to make Wi-Fi work, but the support person helped, and now I can do it myself. You can use 270 GSM paper. According to this product specification it can take up to 300 GSM papers.Cons: 1. Connecting with Wi-Fi is sometime big issue. I have restart printer to connect.2. Extremely slow. Full size color photos with the highest quality setting are taking more than 10 minutes sometime. Even 5*7 photo paper is taking 5 minutes.3. During printing if there is an error it just stops working unless you restart.Overall for home use this is fine. But if you want to use it for many pages on a daily basis, I don't think this will be sufficient."
5,"Very nice product with fast delivery within 2 days, thank you Amazon.Affordable price Rs.11999 with great featuresI will not write any pros or consPrinting quality is awesome whether be or colour , normal or photo paper.I am suggesting to everyone specially to students,home user, small office userIt is good for themBecause don't waste your money for auto duplex printingYes I agree sometimes need of add but it is also helpfulI did 700pages prints in one day in both sideOn wifiDid Xerox,scan everythingGo for it and save money"
5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied good quality, received in 4 days only."
5,"I have received it yesterday in original packaging and no extra packaging from the seller but received the product in good condition.The printer looks good, easy to install and wifi connectivity is good.But the cost per page is yet to be seen and I think one should go for this printer.It is good deal if you have to do home job printing."
5,"I have been using this Printer for the last one month and would really recommend it to others. I have got it connected to my phone as well as my Macbook Air and to be very honest, not only the installation was easy but also it prints wirelessly without any hassle. Never have I faced any paper jam issues either ...In one word its just Amazing!!Just note for Mac users the right driver has to be downloaded & installed properly else the wireless printing might not function seamlessly."
1,"Useless product, gets hangged every single minute. Most of time command taken but showing error without any reason.Can't take print of more than 2 pages at a single time. So if you have to print multiple page, please be available to post command for 2 page each minutes and at the same time keep praying to God that no error comes meanwhile, otherwise add 10minutes restart process etc.However I would say this is one of the worst option in the market, so please stay away and better try something else."
4,Looked at many brands and finally settled on Brother after doing a bit of web research. Print quality is fairly good. I had a HP cartridge based printer and colors are not as bright as a cartridge based printer. This has a manual software based duplex printing option which is fairly useful when you get used to it and you have large documents to print. The scanner is good. But what has been a bit of disappointment for me is the print/scanning desktop application. This is not well designed. The scanning software does not allow inline editing for scanned input ..this is particularly annoying when you cannot crop or adjust brightness of multi page PDF documents. Print speed is good for B/W pages.
4,yess the product was easy to install..the only tuing i missed was as xompared to J140 this T420 donot have led screen to read the instructons..only buttons are available..paying more price than the old one i kept for 8 years seems unreasonable for not giving screen reader..evrytime u have to look in manaul to look for different functions...another thing it takes longer time to boot when switched on..rest fine...the USB cable could have been little longer instead..i bought this keeping in mind my previois experience with brother...thia time i was looking for something more as i paid more
5,"Pros:1. Compact and ergonomic.2. Paper tray box (protects dust and moisture) which no other brand offers.3. Remove jam paper very easily than other ink tank printers.4. Printing speed is fast and vibrant. 80 gsm paper recommended to avoid paper jam.5. Consumes only 11 Watt electricity in use so you can easily operate it on inverter in case of no electricity.6. Wireless setup and printing is very easy.7. Best built quality. Weights 6.4 Kg much heavier than HP, Canon and Epson Ink tank printers.Cons:1.  No spill-free refill system."
5,Worth money spent
5,Good product go for it if auto duplex is not an issue.Printer will not get jam even if you don't print for a month.That too in cold in North India.So yes good.Clean and fast printing.Ibrother app is good.Can be paired with many devices.My printer remains switched on 24/7
2,Extremely difficult to setup. Seems like an obsolete model. I still haven't been able to set it up on my Mac on a preferred old 10.11 osx. Got it working through a third party morpia Android app but not on my Mac. Please share driver for mac 10.11. And on latest mac osx I still have not been able to print from ms word etc. I have to use the broter application. Frustrating.
2,"This is likely a good printer. But, if you use a Mac Book or any other Apple product the setup is cumbersome and inefficient. The Brother website does not offer proper drivers and the iprint and scan app is dysfunctional with limited options and at best is a crippled app. Do not buy if you are an Apple user!"
4,The product came well packed. The installation is very easy. Took black and white as well as colour printouts were good with proper clarity and no smudges
5,It is easy to setup and live to its features flawlessly. The usage is very easy and the manual and cd is easy to follow and guide you well and you are ready to start in minutes.Have been using it from more than a week.May update here later to keep you posted.Thanks. I üíØ recommend you. Worth your bucks and Brother is a reputed brand since many many years.
1,Does not support MAC OS
5,It's been 4 months and the printer is working smoothly. No issues and ink also does not dry up fast. Better than the inkjet printer where ink dries up quickly if not used.wifi makes life easier to print from anywhere within the home.
5,"Good quality printer , print quality is very good, used for a fortnight still it's too early for a review. My initial experience is overall good only lagging is that it should have a lcd display for easy operation."
5,"Pro's:1) printer speed for black&white is absolutely very fast than these price range printers2) wifi works better, boot speed is less than 30 seconds3)color prints with GSM sheets are better than expectedCon's: user manual is poor, please refer to brother's website/YouTubeInk tank type - extremely careful as the slipe was too narrow"
1,About the product order i got wrong item lower version printer DCPT220 Ihad ordered DCP420 higher version.The product sucks in overall design u have to put sheets from below the earlier  design of putting sheets on top was best..Quality is not up to mark light pale print.The dealer sent wrong product and created uncensored nuaianses. We wanted wifi printer and he sent this printer.I don't no about the efficiency as the printer tank is half filled even the bottles are given.
5,Amazon has done a great job in delivery and service.  Very good product in appearance.  One day has passed.  Can't give a review yet in Experience for Purchases.
4,"There is no compromise with print quality but function of this printer is very hard to handle because of no screen on the hardware,Rest things are ok."
4,4star so far!! will check after 2 mnths again :) installation is bit time taking!
3,Plz  installation purpose Plz do user friendly  registration  through ur customer care services for ur technicians booking to do demo & installation.It's very difficult to upload the all the data &  billcopy etc for registration.
5,"This is truly the best All-in-One monochrome laser printer in the market. I've been using a laser printer for almost 6 years now. Earlier my printer was Canon MF3010 with which I wasn't satisfied at all as the print quality was very light and after a couple of print, the colour got even lighter. Also, the refilling cost was around ‚Çπ700-800, so after using that printer for many years I was looking for another great printer for my home office. This time I needed a printer which has network printing capability, duplex printing, Google Cloud Printing and low maintenance/colour cost. Initially, I thought I would get an HP printer but none of them had all the features I was looking for and I will never buy Canon again in my life.So, after researching a lot I came across this Brother DCP-B7535DW printer which had everything that I needed. So, I started checking out reviews and finally decided to buy it. I bought it from my local Brother Distributer at ‚Çπ16,400/- whereas on Amazon it is being priced at ‚Çπ19,792/-. In fact, I also checked the price of this printer during Prime Day sale and the price was the same. Hence, I bought it from my local Brother distributor from way cheaper price than Amazon or any other online store.Here are some TL;DR for the printer:Pros:1. The printer has a super high printing speed.2. Print quality is truly amazing3. Cost of toner is about ‚Çπ650/- (Local Brother Distributor Price) which is cheaper than refilling while using the genuine product4. Cost of the drum is around ‚Çπ1450/- (local distributor price) which you only need to change after 15,000 page  print5. The LCD is backlit, so you can see it in a dark environment too.6. ADF is quite accurate and fast as well.7. Print, scan, copy all are super fast. I scanned a page at 1200 dpi which took 15 sec to complete. Amazing.8. Supports Google Cloud Print, which I'm enjoying a lot9. Network Printing works flawlessly.10. Printer shows ink low reminder when needed11. All the software & firmware are always up to date. Brother do provide software support and update their drivers, firmware and software, which you can easily update using the Brother software. Even HP, Canon doesn't do that.12. Also, did I say that the print quality is mind-blowing, it is even better than inkjet and local xerox machines.13. Superfast duplex printing.14. Build quality is very good.Cons:Found nothing so far. If I do find any, will definitely update my review here.I can definitely say that this is the best printer I have used in my life. The upfront payment maybe a little high, but the features you are getting and the amazing printing quality along with low toner cost, trust me, in the long run, you will benefit from it. Also as this is a lazer printer even if you don't print daily, your ink won't stop working."
3,"This product is good and we'll but this one cartridge no fillings , it's buy new cartridge every time it's 1000 or 3000 rs"
5,"Love this printer. Its got all functionalities for auto scanning with the automatic document feeder, duplex printing. Wifi support. Most other companies with all these features are way expensive.I faced lot of issues on Wifi connectivity, where in between large document scanning through ADF, it will suddenly stop in between.A different printer model from Brother, an user (all credit to that person) had suggested these steps. Please do the same and it will work perfectly over WifiInstall the latest firmware on the printer by downloading from Brother siteDo these steps on the printerFirst setup your Wifi using the set up wizard under Menu->Network->WLANThena) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Staticb) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.c) Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.Now the printer will always stay connected to the wifi."
5,"It has auto 2-sided printing, which is a real paper saver."
2,"My machine was purchased in February 2021 and it has been just 4 months.During this time, I have printed our ~19,000 copies.All the while I have only ever purchased toner from official sources.I've already spent on purchasing 2 drums even though one drum is supposed to have the life of ~ 12,000 copies.Today the machine stops working and upon contacting the support centre (Again) I'm being told that my machine's ""guided machine life is over""How can a company be manufacturing machines whose 'guided life' is less than half a year and under 20K copies?The whole experience with owning a ""Brother"" printer has been an expensive and frustrating one.I can't believe I am saying this - however, I genuinely miss my old HP LaserJet 1030 which served me for over 7 years and through hundreds of thousands of copies. Even though using HP had its own share of issues, it was definitely CHEAPER!"
4,"Duplex printing works one in three times. The paper keeps jamming. Almost impossible to take multiple duplex print.Besides that, the printer's other function, print quality works well."

5,"Nice printer, printing quality is good , its print both side of paper one by one fast."
5,"Overall A+ category product. Fine quality prints. Wifi working great, easily printable with mobile also. Easy to use. Easy sync with mobile as Laptop. ADF working flawlessly. ID card printing is hassle free. Scanning shows true colors, no issues at all.But, Amazon delivery was super pathetic. They took extra 14 days to deliver after being dispatched. Amazon's delivery system needs some real quick fixes."
5,"This one rocks. For almost 18 years, I was stuck with DeskJet printers with their slow printing speeds and high cost of cartridges but finally decided to go for laser printer and was recommended Brother printer by my sister. Initially I was hesitant because we were so used to buying HP or Canon printers but I went by the reviews and I must say that it was a great decision.Set up is quite easy and in case there is difficulty in understanding the written instructions, one can find you tube videos on how to install. It's very easy and straightforward.Contrary to some reviews, I had no difficulties in setting up the wifi connection to my laptop. Simply insert the CD-ROM and follow the online instructions.Printing is butter smooth and very silent. Printing speed is also fine. The print quality is actually quite good compared to a DeskJet. Scanning and photocopy are very straightforward using online apps.There is another Brother printer model which is quite popular but this one is the latest 2018 model. I am not sure of other models like HP, Canon etc but they are costly and don't provide all features.Just go for it and you won't regret."
5,"I've researched a lot about all-in-one laser printers and I don't regret my choice. The printer is well built and print quality is quite good. Haven't got a chance to measure the toner life yet, since I am a light user. Seems ideal for occasional use, especially after my bad experience with my last HP inkjet printer, which used to dry up the ink cartridge very fast and eventually, corrupted the head. Didn't bother to get it repaired (which would result in me shelling out nearly Rs.800 for just the black cartridge apart from service charges). At this price, I can buy a toner to get 1000 pages output and need not worry about ink drying up!"
1,I brought this product starting it was working good but when I took 200 xerox offer that toner is not working even warranty services also not responding
1,Do not buy this printer. It has many problems. It always shows replace Toner codes. Original toner is very costly. It does not accept compatible toner. This a great problem.
2,Product is good but printing from mobile app is not good because it take too much time to connect and also many time it shows failed.
3,"Had expected a very good product from Brother, therefore, I decided to change my loyalty from HP to Brother. However, it does not live upto expectation. Machine frequently goes into Offline mode and everytime, have to lodge complain to correct the mistake. Also it is very slow to respond, once print command is given. HP was definitely better machine."
5,Very good product and Value for money printer.. but latest feature that is '2 in 1 ID copy' function is present in that machine but it works vertically aligned (that is top and bottom not side by side). Nowadays most of the ID copy is horizontal(side by side) which is actually required for most of the works. So I want a Software update that changes this alignment to horizontal(side by side). One more thing is that in this printer (DCP-B7535DW) we do not use 'ENLARGE/REDUCE and PAGE LAYOUT' function simultaneously. Which is a very useful feature for 'ID COPY' on 1 side of the page (Horizontally Align/side by side align). I request BROTHER TEAM to add at least one feature from these two via software update to ease of using this printer. Thank You.
5,Writing this review after using printer for 1 month1.Good Photocopy speed and scanning (quite slow if you need more depth image)2. Print faint you have to adjust copy setting at text then you get good quality print3. Toner is non refillable you have to buy new one. IF YOU ARE MASTER you can refill it4. Only upto Legal page is scanable in printer5. you can scan A4 directly but for Legal you have to scan with ADF (as small size of scaner).6. You cant photocopy legal size register or binded bunch
4,"I purchase this printer on August Month, working so fine.My Favourite thing in this printer is Wireless,we can directly print and scan via mobile with the help of application (Iprint&scan from play store) without router or modem.Duplex print working fine.Adf scan working fine.Purchased this Printer for only 18,000 from local authorized dealer with one year warranty.I will review about cartridge and refill when I will replace or refill."
5,"Excellent packaging, good courier service, and an excellent printer. It does duplex printing, without making noise, print fast enough, good quality print, and accepts print command through wifi-direct, Bluetooth, and also connects to a wifi network or LAN. All in all, it is an incredible product.I use it for my office, and also print study worksheets, materials for my kids."
3,Copier performance is very low even after keeping high-density there is no clarity on the Xerox copy. I hope they improve the performance at least in the next generation
3,Its good value for money. Only concern is scan via ADF is having line and not able to fix it. Good for light home office work. All in one printer simple go fo it. I am liking it better than other brands.
4,Best printer if your usage is less and you don't want INK-Tank printers. It got all the ticks right as per my requirement and cartridge is very very cheap (800/- on official brothers site). Better go for it. You will not regret. Got it for 18999/- on offer and may be that's why it was shipped almost after 15 days of ordering. Product was received in very sturdy packing.Register your warranty on brother website after purchase. Upload everythign and they will register your product.
5,I like the double sided printing that saves papers and I can also use legal size paper and A4 size paper via automatic feed and manual feed.Toner can be saved as well by using conservative mode.
4,I am surprised why duplex scanning not possible though ADF is available? This I have seen in the then Amazon Advertisement. Bulky printer.
4,"when toner low is on the screen, i change the powder and set the printer. then i see replce the toner on the screen . then i search the youtube fot the problem...  and procees. then again and again replace the toner is come o the screen... what i do?  i purchaes the printer on november 2019... and got it at 20th november 2019..."

4,"Amazing printer, u can print both sides, fast printing but if u are looking for fast print and scan then don't go for this one. 4 stars only because it takes ages in scanning in comparison to big office printers coz I have a habit of those n didn't think it would take 10times more time. Even 5 times would have been fine."
5,"Brilliant machine which delivers what it says. Special mention for 2 side printing, fast A4 scanning & ID copy... Love the machine"
5,Amazing 1 day delivery by Amazon - lightening speed. Delightful printer performance. Exceeded expectations. Buying after using 2 well known market brands. Wifi connection so easy. Just marvellous overall experience.
1,This printer can perform heavy task very easily but it is not capable to perform very basic task.There is a lot of improvement required. After 6 months of usage I don't think that I can suggest it to any
3,Prints very slowly.  Prints at the most 12 pages per minute.  No way this can print more than that even with blank papers.
5,Quick and easy software driver install and easy to connect to Wifi by just entering SSID and pwd. After that the printer was autodetected on Apple Airprint and on windows laptops. Super simple.Multiple scan options - easy to use feed tray for scanning/copying multiple sheets.Only small negative if at all: it installs 3+ apps on the desktop which are not really needed since print/scan etc work directly in-context.
5,Delivery was hassle free. Packaging was appropriate. Installation was easy and manuals were very helpful. Print quality is good. Scanning is also fast.But it has no double side scanning through auto matic feeder. So that's the disadvantage. Otherwise this printer works fine.
5,Using for house. Professional quality prints. Duplex print inbuilt.First time it came without drum but Amazon replaced the product without much trouble.
5,Very good printer and Xerox
1,"This product is mot able to connect with WIFI, Customer care said we are not manufacturing updated product it can't be connected with 5 giga hertz connection which is provided by maximum internet provider. Customer care is also worst. Don't buy this product at all."
5,Works as expected. Easy to use with Windows/Mac and Android - tested all over WiFi. At this price range (18.5k via Appario Retail) looks to be the best Multifunction Laser Printer with WiFi and ADF support.
4,"This is my 2nd printer. It's a beast with some wireless connectivity issues. You won't Complaint about print quality ,speed. For first week I had this jamming issue but it was eventually gone with the use.Go for this! It's good buy."
5,"Best printer. It has all the features for an office purpose.Better quality print, have networking, wifi direct, faster print speeds."

1,"Hi, This printer was connected to my main system. Two other computers are connected to this main system. Initially I was able to give prints from my other systems, But suddenly one day, I was not able to Print  from my other systems. On contacting the HP support, they say, this printer does not work on a network....I wonder how it was printing since so many days? Thereafter I was unable to print Excel & PDF documents from my main system. This time I was told that the softwares ( PDF & Excel) would have a problem...My only take is if you  dont want a problem, then avoid this printer"

1,"I had previously given a 5 star rating, but changing it now only after 2 days of use.The entire print has a grey undertone to it, and there are black bands on both edges of the paper.Have made repeated calls to Amazon to have the unit replaced, and they tell me that they have processed it, but no reply over email, no ticket number of the request or any communication regarding the replacement process. It feels like they are trying to stall so that the window to request replacement is over and I am stuck with a defective machine.Very disapoointed."
1,printer have manufactured defects. brother engineers say it physically damage. and it is now out of warranty. I am speechless. what a bad experience.
5,"This is a revolutionary product offering from Brother where in they have reduced the cost of printing in laser products similar to ink tank . The toner costs only 900 rs which is way cheaper than HP and canon toners which cost 4000 rs and the price of the prduct is also cheaper than HP and canon lasers. All in all a great product with god functionality and additional features like duplex printing. if you compare this to the top selling model in the market - hp 1005 , which is priced at 17k , this is a clear winner as it is multi function , plus duples , 3k cheaper plus cost of consumables is only 900 rs !!"
5,Awesome product got in just 11000 bucks a great deal and a great product.
1,Brother DCP-B7500D Multi-Function Centre with Automatic 2-Sided PrintingVERY BAD PRINTER & BAD SERVICE FOR SERVICE CENTER...DONT PURCHASE BRODHER PRODUCT......
1,"this printer is after 5 months was given this xerox and print, every time change toner and their price is 1000 rs. I especially tell you didn't buy this printer"
4,"The print quality is great and it's quite fast too. Automatically prints both sides of the paper. Scanner and copier functions work fine. I had no trouble with installation. I'm quite surprised at the connectivity options though (the lack of them to be precise). It only has a USB port. And that's it. Not even an Ethernet port. If it had Wireless connectivity, it would have been ideal for me. But it doesn't. It's pretty expensive for what it has to offer, but it does print very well. I've had big problems with inkjet printers, and I've learnt that ink tank printers have problems with printer heads becoming bad in a year or so. So, laser was the only option for me. I don't print very often and I don't want to keep changing the cartridge  every time I want to use it. I hope it lasts a while - it looks quite sturdy."
1,"NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PRINTER, WORST EVER PRINTER I USED. PURCHASED 2 MONTHS BEFORE, CARTRIDGE AND DRUM DAMN LOW QUALITY"
5,Writing this review after two months of usage. Print quality is good. Its easy to install and I did not need an engineer from Brother to assemble it. Its very easy.  Printing speed is also good. Its easy to install and use. Scanner could be a bit faster. All in all its a good printer and great value for money. Very good for home or office use. Though I wish they had given some color options.
5,Toner finished in only 12 days....i dont know how they said it print 2600 pages....i only printed arround 600 pages...It is completed one month again toner has finished by just taking fifteen pages daily...coste is 900...again we have to go on printing shop for cheapest print
5,"Having spent my life trying to get good prints from ink-jet printers, worrying of ink levels, getting my hands/clothes stained with ink and cost of cartridges, this Brother printer is now complete peace of mind, I have finally find found Nirvana. The duplex printing feature, the well designed backlit LCD with user-friendly menus, the auto wake-up and sleep, the fully covered bottom tray design, the 2 sided ID card copier on same page, clean backside, all are well designed features of this printer, go for it."
1,After using of 2 months the printer is asking for replacement of toner cartridge.Shall I have to refill or have to purchase a new one.Kindly suggest....
5,Value for money...Very nice printer34 page per minute
5,"The printer has a good speed, The print quality is also very good ,the first toner given with the printer doesn't print up to the claimed 2600 pages."
1,I only print 965 copies my printer toner is exhausted. It claims to print 2600pages but cant event print half the number of pages. Dont buy if considering cost effective printer else everything is fine.
5,"Super product without any problem, blindly trust in this printer if you are going to buy a new one. My first printer is from Hp but...after corona pandemic, i hate china and chinese products....so blindly trust in this japanese product."
5,Best printer.Printing Speed is osmloaded with lots of features.User friendly software.Far better than HP Printers.
5,Print quality for photo and dark mode not upto mark but speed and text print good. Worth for money. Go for it if you want cheap and good printer
5,Really I am satisfied with this printer... In this price it is super machine... I recommend to buy this product with out any doubt...

3,Good Quality and easy to use
5,This machine is good quality but i fine out more cheaper price thats why i have return the printer
5,Best deal.  Waited for 10 days for price drop.  it fluctuated between 13000/- to 14500/- and finally purchased for 12500/-.  Best features among other similar printers.Delivered within less than 24 hrs.
3,"It needs the firmware and drivers to be installed from the CD that comes with the printer. Updated firmware and software is available online, but the printer refused to work with those until I installed the ones from the CD first. Since I had a laptop that didn‚Äôt have a CD/DVD Drive, I had to buy a separate portable Drive to install from the CD first.Once installed, it‚Äôs printing and copying works fine. Getting the scanner to work took more fiddling with software.Not really plug and play if you don‚Äôt have a CD drive"
4,"It is good priter , hp help center is also too good,"
5,"Used this for almost one year, the cartridge that comes with it last only for 500 papers , after that you have to buy an another cartridge ,otherwise the printer is great quality is fine"
1,Not able to install its driver neither provided  CD nor online software even by remote expert by hp expert. Very very poor and negative response both from Amazone and hp support team when asked to return/ replace. Lost Rs 13500 of its cost with too much frustrating reply from Amazone and hp. Never never by online products which require technical support. I am signing out from Amazone.
5,"Special thanks to APPARIO RETAIL LIMITED...for giving a fresh piece. Thank you AMAZONE for delivering the package 4 days before the expected date.About the printer.... printing speed is good. Printing quality is good.scanning speed is good.zoom and micro is good.software is good.. totally user friendly.What I am sad is about....is...when I purchase this item the price was 13950 next day it dropped to 12499...no time to return...second one is....size of cartridge,it's small in size...need to reefil frequently....overall the printer is good....8-04-2019 after taking 800 copy and 150 scanning..the printer is working properly...no complaint...now I have to shake the cartridge before taking first print....seems ,the toner level has gone low..only problem is the cartridge eald...15-4-2019No problem with the printer and print . One thing that should be noted is , you must use good quality ink...thank you."
4,"Good printer, but need earthing otherwise you will get shock from USB cable which connect to laptop, I don't understand why its design is like that, I call customer service technician he said this printer must need earthing. This is my only equipment in my home which require earthing. I argued to technician because I never see such kind of printer design which require earthing all the time, may be I got faulty printer. And I am using it with earthing. That means all the time when my printer works I am grounding some amount of power. Pls if someone has any idea regarding my printer problem, share with me."
5,"I am writing this review after using this product for 3 months.Print Quality:-Print quality is amazing as compared to others printer in this price range.Photocopy is not much good but the if you print any documents/photos by laptop then you get the nei quality.Overall print quality is best üëåEasy to Use:-Yes,it is very easy to use this product you don't need to read the booklets to use this product. And also it is easy to install the software in the PC. (This includes CD)And Controller are simple and fine.Ink:-As in the description box there was written that you get 1000copies with single toner .But i think its wrong. I have printed about 200pages on -3DPI the ink detector started showing me that your ink is low. And when printed some more documents (about 20),it was end.In Simple word, In the description box there was written that you can upto 1000copies with single toner. But i am able to print only 220 Pages on Single toner (-3DPI). Maybe first time printer consume more Ink.Other :-Other things like price, Printer made quality,Size,Wires, Internal Parts, Delivery,etc. all are excellent üëå.Thanks."
5,"1. HP Laserjet Pro M1136 Multifunction Printer is really amazing.2. It works very nicely and efficiently.3. Its duplex facility is excellent but it does not print two sides automatically. Lifting printed pages, you have to insert them again in their opposite position- which is also simple.4. It printing quality is incomparable.5. It prints pages in booklet formats also.6. It provides a best feature, i.e., you can cancel your printing anytime with is button on the printer.7. It prints pages in two qualities: 1200 p and 600p.8. A special thing about this printer is that it saves electricity and ink with its option ink-saver.9. It has no WiFi facility.10. Its Xerox quality is also excellent.11. It is better than brother printers.12. In all, this device is superb. Don't think too much. Go with it."
1,"This product is not for India as well H P is not providing any support. As a company you must be careful in supply of product of a who doesn't support product, because I tried my west having complain no BNZF4511-01."
5,Fully satisfied.before buying this printer i think how to refill the ink and what will happen if the ink is  fully consumed....but it is easy to REFILL the powder ink. Powder ink is refilled by myself it‚Äôs Very easy.I am giving this review after 3 months of usage.
5,It has proven to be a very good printer for me so far. I have ran 3 toner cartridges (over 4000 pages)  through it and have gotten very high quality repeatable results. No issues at all with printing whatsoever. I have only ever had two paper jams and that was due to my own stupidity where I put the paper with crumpled edges. Perfect printer for home and small office use. I do not require my printers to be WiFi enabled as they are shared over a network anyway so it is perfect for my requirements. Your mileage may vary.
3,"A robust printer. However, when u start it for the first time, the scan fails and you need to redo it. But thereafter it runs fines. The printer is great but the scan files come out too large for mid-size DPS scans of 600 / color."
1,The drivers delivered with the printer are more than 6 years old and they are not working. I have tried downloading them from the HP website but same issue. I have spent two days trying to install the drivers to no avail. I tried calling HP and after endless waiting they were not able to help. Finally I have to take the printer and my laptop to software service guy near to my home to get them installed. This is worst printer I have seen in device or support.
1,"My first experience with this is a completely negative one.Was so excited to set it up... unfortunately, after a lot of wasted time I discovered the scanner wasn't working.Replacement of this product is available but Amazon refuses to consider a return, even though the fault lies from their side.... giving a defective product in the first place without checking the item.Customer service representatives are of no help on this. A policy is a policy, so no returns allowed on this!!My suggestion: DO NOT BUY ELECTRONIC ITEMS FROM AMAZON... RETURN POLICY NON EXISTENT!Update 11th August:Replacement sent. Everything seems to be okay. Copying quality was average; Printing and Scanning very good! Easy to install and easy to use. Registered for the Warranty online - had no problem.So far so good! Let's hope it stays that way!"
1,"The product was defective. The computer did not recognise/detect/install the printer. The  Drivers did not Install from CD or downloaded from the Internet. On top of it Amazon hassled me for two days before accepting a return and refund even though they did not say the product is ""non returnable"" on their website."
5,"Best product ,best quality , best amazon delivery ,I liked this"
5,i really happy with this printer its working really great and the printing quality superb.its very easy to install and operated manually and also photo copy quality wonderful thank to Amazon  for delivering me fast in a day and for affordable price i have more then 2000 rupees discount on MRP.
1,"We had purchased this printer before 6 month, but I recommend you this is the extreme level third class printer with poor quality service. Ink is not proper working, it shows again and again blinking light of Ink refill. Set up is too much tedious.  After 1 hour of waiting setup is not running properly. Totally dissatisfy with HP service all time. Instead of I recommend Canon Printer for easy setup and easy to use."
4,As yet 15 days using the product with no issues. Hopefully it will keep on going as is. Little extra space culd have been given for scanner n xerox wuld make large demand to product...
5,Great for home and buisness use..
4,"This product is good, but if you want 100-200 prints daily then this fine.. then you want to buy 1005, when you buy free you can print 400-600 prints only after you want change toner or refill it, after refill you can face many problems like hang, black print, stop while you can print 100 above prints. Slow if print 20-30 plus prints. But overall this good product product for home use and light uses. I Give him 5 stars, but now i feel i can buy 1005 or above. Thats why i will give 4 stars"
4,"Very wonderful product ,bought nearly 1 yr back .working goodWe are not very frequent . Only drawback is that after print is faded,you have to removeInk cartridge and shake it and insert again to get uniform print. Definitely that‚Äôs not a tedious job."
3,"Demo toner gives you just 100 to 300 pages print. After that you have to buy new toner which would cost you ‚Çπ4500....So don't just buy printer according to your budget, but ‚Çπ4000 less so that afterwards you can buy toner...My demo toner which use to come with the printer, finishes within an hour after installation."
5,Very Good products
1,Tried installing with Drivers CD as well as well downloaded drivers online from HP's support website but it didn't work on my i7 laptop with Windows 10 even after installing latest firmware.  Support contact number was always unreachable. Sent email to HP's given support dept with no response. Have no option than to return product.
5,"Excellent printer. Slim, light weight attractive design. Simple installation. I didn't have cd drive in laptop so downloaded it from hp site and installed without any issue. Unpacking is also simple. For both unpack and driver install, you can refer any video in YouTube.Printing is fast and quality is very good. Photocopy is also nice. Overall I am very happy to have this printer"
5,Print quality is superb. No issues. But dissapointed with the dry cartridge which was installed in it. It did not even print more than 25 pages and had to order another cartridge within a short period. So utterly dissapointed. So seller to please before shipping the item. Rest it's fine.
5,"This product is actually good for households office , enterprise who does use it for heavy duty . It is well packed and easy to install. It has a catridge which can print 700 pages. Later can be refilled . The photocopy , scan, print is high quality ,sharp and fast printing . It does it's process very quite and efficiently. The price is very good for this product ..... The print quality is satisfying, very easy to install"
5,"What makes the HP LaserJet Pro M1136 Multifunction Monochrome Laser Printer truly amazing is its print quality. The prints are crisp and preserve detail. You also get a built-in scanner. However, software installation on the computer or laptop can be real pain, at-least that's what i found. After you download the latest driver software for printer from HP, you might end up not having the set-up appearing right after the extraction of the exe file gets complete.For this you need to click the Windows Start button & type %temp% into the search bar,then open the shown Temp folder. Open the latest HP installation ""7z"" folder then double click HpSetup.exe and opt for ""easy installation""Right after this, you still might face the dilemma of your printer not being shown as default, which in-turn meant i couldn't print documents although i could now use my scanner. To get rid of this issue i completely uninstalled whatever HP software got installed from my Windows 10 64bit exe file. Now i downloaded the Windows-7 64bit version, And for some weird reason everything worked fine and the HP LaserJet Pro M1136 was now showing as my Default printer. Do remember, just because such problems occurred during my installation doesn't necessarily mean the same is going to happen with you, so keep that in mind and proceed accordingly.Lastly, if you do scan a lot of documents, and want to create a Windows Shortcut for your HP scanner on your desktop, then this is how you can do it.Simple type ""WIAACMGR"" into your windows search bar. Also, before you do this, do ensure the printer is connected to the computer. After you type the command, simple Right Click on ""WIAACMGR"" you will get the option to open ""File Location"" Click on it and it will take you to the specific scanner short-cut.  Now, you can either drag and Drop the icon to the desktop or simply 'send it to desktop'. Finally just rename the icon accordingly.I wouldn't say this printer is the fastest, but at this price point its certainly worth the value for the print quality it offers and the features it presents. Also, HP cartridges are readily available than their counterparts.This makes the HP LaserJet Pro M1136 a value proposition."
1,This product is useless..never buy this process... Product which i got is defective..it doesnt print ..neither amazon company replace this product ...
5,I was searching for a 3 in 1 laser printer and I didn't want to go for a lcd one as the lcd will get damaged after couple of years of usage so wanted to go for a 7 segment display printer. Finally this one does the job for me. Happy with HP
4,"This HP Printer is good with regards to the Print Quality, User-friendliness but the Yield of Printouts from its Cartridge is not so satisfactory as I would have liked."
5,It is very simple to use but installation for windows 10 is very difficult. I requested the Service Center to help me for installation after approx one week 'so called  Engineer' (Because he don't have enough knowledge) come and installed. The service of Hp Service Center is not satisfying.
1,Very Bad. we have kept this aside and no body is coming on call even in warranty period......
2,Paper jam is a main problem. Suitable software is not available in the site. No directions were given by the distributor for how to download or the link of the site.The installation CD given is not completely downloaded. It shows errors.
5,"this is really nice machine works well with my pc . One more thing you can print from mobile using otg , now just one week passed I print more than 200 pages n its working fine . The bundled cartridge is little disappointing cause it can print only 700 pages . now will see how much will it print"
1,Very very low quality printer.1. Electricity current in back of the printer and earthing problem.2. Very slow scanning process approximately 3 minutes per page.3. No help by amazon customer care.4. I am very sad after purchase this product.
5,Company people come and opened the box and installed the Xerox machine to my pc so no problem with that and I am using it for last 1 year. I am happy with my xerox machine. Operating the Xerox machine is also very simple and easy. Printing quality is excellent.
5,This printer is very brilliant under 15000.19 pages per minute.Printing quality is 100 /100.800 to 1000 pages print in one refil and refil price is 90 to 100 originalThis is very brilliant product but delievery time is too long 5 to 6 days.
1,The product was faulty and HP has declined to replace under warranty. Amazon has been showing technicalities before us and there is only an exchange of mails. The amount of over Rs  13000/- Is like swindled away and no resolution at site. Meanwhile the seller is nowhere in picture.
1,"Product description says it's bluetooth.My android billing software works only with bluetooth printer, but i received non-bluetooth.It's major misleading from seller..."
4,Working as i wished.Easily connected via Bluetooth from multiple devices.Fast print.Nice autocut. Reason for 4 star is printing quality is good not best.Might be paper roll causing the issue. Yet to check.Rest a perfect device for me.
5,"Best option for a Bluetooth thermal printer..Daily is frequent , prints quick and the auto cut feature is really helpful"
5,using in my shop and its working perfectly for now....
1,Video Player is loading.
5,Product is not working even not get a customer care number.. completely worthless.
4,First impression good. Printing quality good. Overall budget level super printer.
5,Definitely value for the money...easy installation..
5,Very good product
5,Best of multi thermal printer 80mm
1,Very. Poor quality.existed only 5 days
1,Bad quality üòîüòîüòî
5,Nice one
1,"Horrible product from HP. I bought it despite the negetive reviews. For gods sake dont buy it. No option for automatic double sided print, need to feed it into a clumsy tray manually. Ink bottle refills are not yet available everywhere. It GT-53XL, search for it yourself (Black Cartridge)Ink smudges while highlighting, its a disaster. I couldn't use it enough in the first 10 days hence I am stuck with this product."
5,"Because there were no reviews, I was very confused to buy this printer. Packaging was good and thoughtful. Setup completed in 15 minutes from hp website video. Wireless setup is very easy from HP Smart app. Main benefit is Apple Air print, Google Cloud print. Tried black print which is sharp. Tried colour print on glossy paper which looks great. Perfect colour reproduction. Don't find need to connect to usb cable. Wireless connection is very seamless."
5,"I am reviewing this printer after 15 days usage at home. its a very good printer from HP. we can configure on wifi, and print from any where. print quality is very good. Ink usage is very less. I have printed many high quality photos but looks no effect on Ink level. setup is fast and very easy. just need to install HP app it will configure product automatically on wifi as well. Amazon delivery was also very good."
1,"The packaging is so scanty that when I opened the carton, product was broken. The scanner glass totally shattered and the side plastic case also slightly broken. Amazon did not have an extra packaging, it came in HP carton. There was no packing material to safe the top part, which holds the scanner. Also the printer itself is pretty big, but not sturdy and strong enough to withstand transportation shocks."
1,"Don't buy this model, wireless printing is way too slow & more importantly it has print head problem.As soon as I connected it to internet, it downloaded updated firmware & started showing print head issue.I did some googling to troubleshoot found YouTube videos posted by HP, troubleshooting steps didn't help but I found comments from people across the world mentioning print head problem & HP should consider recalling all the printers.Luckily it was last day for me to return the product on Amazon & got full refund from the seller.I purchased Canon g3000 series printer , I am not marketing Canon but it's wat too supervisor product than HP, Check it yourself."
1,"The main usp of this product was Bluetooth printing and fast processing speed VS Hp419/415 AIO product.  Bluetooth printing was not working and to return this product it took hell of lots of time, efforts, letter from HP etc...given to amazon after that they processed my return/refund. And worst part is neither Amazon is aware of this product features nor the HP technical ground staff could support.  ONLY HP authorized people were aware of that extra feature."
1,"Product has been received with carrriage cover damaged, hence printer is not working. Hp engineer has visited and submitted his report for physical damage inside printer.Need to return the item but return / replacement window is closed.Pls suggest how to get this printer replaced / rectified"
1,It's just a month old and I am facing print head issue. Didn't expect this kind of issue to surface within a month. I am talking to HP customer support. In a nutshell I am not happy with this product as I expected that I won't face any issue atleast during the first year. Now I am talking to HP customer support so it will be a test of HP customer service and their warranty obligations too. I will provide update later on HP addresses this issue.
1,"New Printer was delivered on 28.12.2020. This stopped working in a couple of days. Got a replacement Printer on 19.01.2021 after daily calls to HP Support & Local Service Centre. The replacement machine also stopped working within 2-3 days. Technicians from local HP Service Centre have visited thrice, last being on 04.02.2021, but they are unable to resolve the problem . Either the machine is defective or the Service Centre people are not qualified enough. As on date i.e.16.02.2021, I am still without a working printer seven weeks of buying a new one. I have been told by the Service Centre that they have put in a request for a refund, which I have not received till date. Over the last few weeks, I have had to make numerous calls to HP Support, Local Service Centre & have written to HP via email at least 6 times, but to no avail. It has been an exasperating experience to say the least  & to mention again, I am still without a working Printer."
1,"It's a good printer if it works for more than 10 days.Though print quality,cost per print is excellent. I have been facing issues in printing where in black print is not appearing. Getting through support or help is a humongous task. Better not to buy if you are not printing like 20-30 pages a day. As usual response from HP is poor and no permanent fixes for the issues. The problems replicate,support fixes the same and again problem replicates. You need to be tech savy if you have to buy this product. In general its a NO NO to buy this...Note getting a fix is a tough one,but really cannot understand why HP does not allow us to create a case id.I have printed more print information sheets than the actual prints.On Dec 1 2020.After multiple follow ups HP support team provided in house support and changed the print head.Its working now. Need to check the longevity now."
2,Printer very  loud noise...very slow print outs...disappointed with printer...Very poor quality material...very delicate....Not suggested...I think it is defect item sold by Amazon.
1,"Not so great product for printing. HP support needs to improve their service,first call to technical support, took 50min, wasted my time. Second call got escalated to a senior guy, he couldn't resolve the driver installation on Windows 7, though on HP product page it says, printer supports for Win 7. Third call also not resolved & the guy asks me to replace Win7 with Win 10! Just for a mistake of buying a Printer, do I need to upgrade OS & Hardware?Now iam using only mobile print. Utter waste of product....."

2,"other hp printers have decent quality but this model is defective. takes almost a minute for 1 print. quality of the print is not good, some times its get struck and have to click print 3 to 4 times. quite annoying to use"
5,"Pros1. Great print quality2. Low printing cost3. Compact4. Very easy to connect and setup (Free setup available from HP which I used to ensure printer is inspected)5. HP support was very fast to set it up. A good way to see how the support coverage is in your area for free.6. Works with Windows and Mac. Did not test with Linux.7. Being both wireless and Bluetooth compatible, easy to get prints/scans from any device.Cons1. Coatly. Not for occasional prints.2. Big in size. May require a separate desk.3. Too many moving parts. The paper output  drawer seems filmsy.4. Printing speed is slower than average deskjets even for black and white or text only pages."
2,"I have happily purchased several HP printers before and bought this one for the environmentally friendly features it offered but, oh boy, I have never such a complicated printer to set up. In the end, I gave up and had a technician come to install it. He spent several hours and had to call HP Support several times. Since I needed a printer, I kept it but I absolutely do not recommend it!"
1,Total money wasteAfter 10-12 pages black print not workingNot good product Total defectiveProcessing Time of copy very1 print take one minute for printingDon't buy this productTotal defective productPrinting Quality Not GoodIn the printing this show the lining in Black printHight Electricity consumable
5,Seller: Appario Retail. I am giving 5 stars overall. Received a new printer in working condition. It came in its original packing. The print quality is quite good with good colour reproduction. Also very low cost printing. Printing is possible directly via the USB cable that came along with it.Printing is also possible from PC/ mobile with Wifi. Only difficulty is in initial configuration of Wifi for a common man because there was no step by step instruction anywhere. An experienced user can easily set it up after doing some research.
1,"Within one week of purchasing the printer, the cartridge stopped working and it takes 3-4 attempts from different mediums to get in touch with HP support. After getting in touch and complaining they inform me that a technician will visit to rectify the printer and they raise a ticket which automatically closes without anyone coming to rectify it. If you want to spend a few days running around and losing your peace of mind then I strongly recommend HP customer service. Probably the worst I have ever seen. More than the product, the way customers are treated is quite shocking."
4,"Thanks to Amazon for the on-time delivery. Only thing for which I am not happy with the HP technical support, I tried to reach techinal support but I was unable to connect the line after 10 tries. At last I did installation on my own through YouTube and luckily it got setup all well. But if I talk about Printer, it  is good with optimum quality as expected, go for it."
4,This product is awesome. Installing the heads is a bit tricky.Purchasing on Amazon is always awesome.Amazon Transportation Services is worse than the worst. But it seems like they are reluctant to improve.
1,HP are interested in ONLY sales. No demonstration call was logged automatically. Eventually I had to install and configure the printer. Upon change of WiFi network printer does not get configured. Absolutely poor technology being sold by HP in India compared to western world. Not being able to use printer for last 1 month. Technicians can not fix the matching by taking remote control of my screen. Despite complaint no one visited me so far. I will refrain from buying HP products in India.
1,"Better not to buy,  2nd day of the use only started trouble error E2 ,and prints very slow. Don't waste money on this and there is no return also"
2,Received the printer and the packing damaged. There was no repackaging items in the box to return. No warranty or instruction booklet.
1,The print quality is extremely poor. Colour prints are not at all good.
2,The printer head broke in six months. The repair work is outsourced to third parties. They have not yet visited my house for repair due to lockdown. But 6am to 10am is still open for  business.
1,HP customer care is the worst in world. Purchased this printer one week ago and have been calling HP Customer care to get it installed. Till now no one has even tried to reach out to me for installation. Amazon customer care doesn't care after product is delivered. So guys please be watchful of HP Products
1,the setup is complex and no proper documentation available online.the tech support was found short.The installation instructions were not very helpful. Overall a hyped product and is not easy to setup.
1,Hp wirelees printer  515 All in one order date was 3 June 2020 delivered 6 June 2020Demo was given from technician  and the print out were perfect but now printer  is not working. Kindly help me out
5,"One of the best ink tank printers available at the moment. Excellent print quality, both general and h.d. photograph."
1,After 2 prints problems starts occurring. Have to reinstall its software or restart again and again. Wanted to return but I started using week ago after buying and these problems are occurring. After every 2 prints diagnose and fix. Thought hp is good there won't be any problem with this product.
5,Print quality - on spotEase of use - after initial understanding... it is very easy. Even double side printing is easy.tech Support - very good online support and user guide
5,It‚Äôs a great printer with Wifi option. Wirelessly also works excellent.
2,After adding print head also getting error- not able to print
5,"Print quality is good, 1st print after turning on takes a bit of time but rest it is fine"
5,The printer is nice and printing quality is also nice for a budget printer
1,"Hi, all in the specification of the product it was mentioned that it supports back-to-back printing, however after purchasing the product I found out that it does not support back-to-back printing. and you have to do it manually."
4,"Product is nice but in my printer error show when I start printer, error message show cartridge end life time.What is its mean ?help"
4,"Writing this review after 3 months of use. I had used HP printers for almost 10 years and I was looking for a change. After some research, I decided to buy this one. It has many pros but a few cons as well.Pros:1: Good pricing for a printer with ADF and duplex print.2: Cost per page printing is economical3: Easy to install and use4: Print, Copy and Scan functions work great.5: Print and Scan Quality is as good as any printer.Cons:1: It's a heavy printer.2: It's not easy to move around3: Makes a lot of noise if Quite mode is not being used.4: Minimum printing DPI is 600..so it can't print in Economical Mode.5: Printer preference are not easy to set.Still, I would say - It's a great value for money Printer."
4,"I have bought this printer for my light office use for independent legal practice. Being a single user of the printer I was looking for a traditional printer without wifi as from my experience I had seen that wifi printers are a bit slow in processing the print command.Things to do to setup the printer:Firstly remove all the red and other tappings on printer. Also, do not forget to remove all the Orange sealings on the cartridge.Once the tappings are removed, plug in the power cord and start the printer for setting up language and time, etc. Do not connect the USB cable yet to the laptop untill the drivers are downloaded.Next download the print Driver (print scan and fax driver combined) for the MF235 model from Canon website before inserting the USB cable in the laptop. In between the download the Driver would ask to insert the USB Cable for successfully completing driver installation. After the combined driver installation, install the MF scan driver which is a standalone driver necessary for scanning. No driver is required to be installed for copying. I do not use fax so I had not installed standalone fax driver.After 2 days of use following are the pros and cons I could find out:A. Pros:1. Good printer with no lagging. Print quality is good. For printing back to back on a non duplex printer one has to firstly print Even pages in reverse order, put the printed pages back and then print odd pages in non reverse order.2. Easy scanner with ADF : Scanning can be done using Canon MF scan driver downloaded from Canon website. One can use PDFsam basic software available free on net for merging 2 PDFs alternatively for scanning a document back to back.3. Copying is as good as a copy done from market. Copying back to back can also be done simply by copying through ADF from front side the sheets and then copying through ADF from back side of the sheets. Also, there is an option for ID Card scanning 2 sides on single page. For ID Card copying ADF would not be used and one has to manually do it on flatbed glass.B. Cons:1. Heavy weight so not easy to move around.2. Not provided a user friendly manual. Thus I tried to write a detailed review for help.Troubleshoot experienced:If the scanner is not detecting documents put in ADF, uninstall the MF Scan driver and reinstall it. The problem would be solved."
2,It's 2 sideo Or not
4,Good product easy to use
4,Happy with it
5,Good
5,Satisfied. It has been 2 months. My usage is super low.. about 10 prints/week. Now you may ask why did I go for laser then? Believe me.. inkjet printers are real pain in the ass. And they come for cheaper price but makes big hole in your pocket from the day one of its usage. This one is super comfortable. Fires up in seconds.. print quality is average but manageable
1,It‚Äôs not a wifi printer
5,"This is the second time I bought the same printer .though the previous one is working fine,  but I trust cannon for the performence so I went for it"
4,"Print quality is good. Canon giving quality product as expected.Value for money: Definitely not for this price of 10k range. Duplex not available. Colour print not available. WiFi print not possible.Installation: My computer having issues, otherwise printer setup and installation was easy.Size & Looks: It is not too heavy. Size of 12' portable TV. Looks elegant and classy.Overall I'm satisfied.Will update the review after few months of usage.Thanks for reading!Review on 27-Oct-2020:----------------------------Tried printing images and it came out really well. This is just b/w printer. I can see every detail of the image.Attached image."
3,"The printer is easy to set up and use, but it has to be used carefully or you get a mild shock. The quality of the print is disappointing as it is rather pale. If fed correctly, the paper comes through smoothly without getting stuck."
4,"Printer is good. Seller sold open box product. Slight marks on body. Review is specifically for the seller who sold open box product. Wanted to return it, but I was in badly need of printer. Cartridge looks duplicate."
1,It was mentioned in the specifications that we can print at both sides of the paper once.. But it is not like that... I wnt to replace it with another one which is auto duplex....
4,"It works well when connected to a laptop, does a pretty decent job and is quite economical. Its a monochrome b/w as mentioned and gives a superfine quality, prints 1100+ pages easily using original or other available cartridges.The only issue I see with this printer, is about is incompatibility beyond laptops, it does work with your mobile, doesnt work with raspberry pi and is quite weird in driver support for other devices besides laptop. Rest all is good."
1,Don't buy not having mobile connectivity as per web page specifications
3,Earlier I have used a LBP2609 for almost 9 years.I am using this printer for last 2 months.This is not a value for money product.Printing quality is not so good. Specially for small fonts printing is very poor. Image printing quality is also average.
4,"Good printer for home use especially for printing notes and photocopies. The problem is that the system doesn't recognize the printer when plugged in. For that uninstall the usb printing supporter and then reinstall, remove the cable and plug in again. The driver will be installed without delay."
5,"Best purchase. Go for it if you print frequently. Use 80gsm paper if you want to print on both sides (since no auto duplex you have to do it manually, like even odd printing). If you use low quality paper then there are chances of getting it stuck in drum roll. Otherwise best. Don't buy ink jet printers."
5,Best printer at this price range.The quality of printing is better than HP. Also the printing cost is very low( similar to hp product at this range). And this product is less costlier than other laser printer .so go for it.
5,I m satisfied with the product.. In the beginning I was a little bit confused with the installation process but with the help of You tube videos sorted it out..Printing Quality is Great..Seller did a good job delivering the product in time..
1,"Within a month from purchase the print quality has become of very poor quality. After contacting amazon, the complaint is nowhere registered. Amazon is requested to replace the Cartridge immediately."
5,"Product as stated on the portal,best in its class,working flawlessly as the brand known for,arrival before time and packing was good,I used it since last one month and till date I satisfied"
3,"Its not a WiFi printer, so if you do not need wifi printer then you should go with brother printer instead"
1,Worst product in this range.....Go to Flipkart and purchase HP printer in same range.This is neither Wifi based nor compatible with android phone.Waste of Money for me.Once you purchased it is not returnable.

1,"Bad quality, can't print on other side of paper bcz of roll over of page, continue stuck of pages, print is not much dark, I recommend ""NOT TO BUY"" Damn serious..."
1,Sent multiple times returned product with multiple labels on it.. packing poor and printer doesn't work properly with missing
3,I need bill of this product against my company gstin number. Contact me 7678214169 as soon as possible.
5,Good and efficient printer.print pages with speed.
1,Nothing to write un happy as expected from cannon

5,good

3,"I am an occasional user. Could not understand "" Cleaning before printing "" as detailed in user manual. More clarity is needed."
5,Superb quality printer. not any problem still now. all way.. this is good printer for use.
5,I fall in love with this printer. great product
5,Grt product
1,Better to buy offline...
5,Without Noise.. Printing.. Worth for Money.. Speedy delivery
1,This printer does not have double side printing feature ... please check before buying..
4,Excellent Job except dual side printing
4,"The printer was easy to install including the wireless settings and I was able to print over Wi-Fi. The catridge life was showing as 10% on the new printer which didn't sound right. So ordered another one (Thanks to Amazon Return policy) which got delivered and old one was picked. Installed all over again and went straight to check the catridge life and it shows 100% now. So make sure you check the catridge life and get it replacedpromptly. Other than that one issue, it seems to be working fine. Have tried both printing and copying. Quality is good."
5,Wish I could have purchased it earlier - I already purchased 4 deskjets/inkjets from last 10 yrs - but I don't know why they eat so much ink - I got tired of ordering its cateridges - Also my kids are in school (11yrs & 6 yrs) and they get something to get print out every second day and during exams - you can understand. This serves my black and white printouts (almost 90% of requirement) and I have HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4335) that serves colored printout (10% of requirement). the print quality and speed is great ! and energy save option is also cool - it remains on standby and whenever you need a printout from your phone or laptop - just give a command and in less than 30 secs you will have your printout :) Amazing. Hassle free. Very satisfied with the product and its features
3,Canon is not giving installation n demo serviceIt takes charges for demo n installationThat's not fair
5,"The product was delivered before time. Excellent printing and quality of the scanner is also pretty good. The machine is the latest in its class and wireless connectivity, printing from smart phone features are superb. All-in-one unit Canon i-SENSYS MF 232w is ideal machine for home. amazon.in has wide variety of products and fully satisfied with their services.Rajendra Joshi17/05/2017"
1,"This was my worst decission to buy a printer from amazon. The product which i received from amazon was a defective one. The box was wet and damaged also the print quality was not as expected so i requested a replace. The replaced product which i received was a 2nd hand product. No seal, broken plastic, used cartridges, all transparent papers removed, no driver cd, no user manual. Be cautious while getting this product as amazon has now started delivering used product."
5,I'm stisfied this has WiFi & usb interface. We can scan and print from mobile phone. No need to switch  on the computer. We can print direct via wi fi without a router connection.
1,There is no two sided printing it's major drawbackFor only office purpose not for commercial purposes
4,"Excellent quality output, i was looking all in one printer for small business with ethernet setup and this suits it. But still i see manufacturing date was 2019 and looks like old stock. Also the cartridge comes inbuilt has only 20% so you have to purchase additional cartridge. Overall product is good hope after sales service also good."
3,"Printer is good, however, getting its toner cartridge is a challenge. Canon website also not been of any help. I didn‚Äôt find their website providing option for purchasing original cartridges. Looks like this printer has to be scrapped due to non availability of original cartridges. Suggest avoid any Canon printers in India. Thanks"
5,I got this printer on 25 th August morning.  I called Canon service Center and requested for sending a person for installation.  They registered my request and on same day I got it installed from Service Center. There were no charges for installation.  Very professional service personnel.  Would recommend everyone to download Canon app register the product and call for service help.First day my rating is 5 star.
5,Decent printer with superb features like wifi features.....makes it's more convenient to be use it while placing it in any corner of room/house.Also one more thing first one have some issues Amazon as well as seller simply replace it and suggest replacement by their own means not unnecessary bothering me...So it's superb deal for me....10/10Printing quality is acceptable....Also many other features like printer screen advised every time if printing matter is outnof paper range...Printer-cum-Scanner also it's  upside...So it's highly recommended.....Canon's machine.....
5,Very good product from canon.This is not Chinese product. This made by south koria. And Japan based Company. It's Good think.Toner used 337.
4,Canon should send its person to install the new printer and sync it with our existing network systems.We had to unnecessarily pay extra Rs.1500.00 to our maintenance person.The cartridge given with printer had very short life of few days of normal printing of about 10-15 pages/day.
5,"Mass productIt does not support duplex printing.It is faster when we connect to ur computer or mobile wired or wireless.And we can make certain paper setting in the printer itself instead of doing it in ms word.There is a difficulty to setup a CD drive in computer,if u look and read the guide properly you will be able to setup .Thatsall"
1,"Print quality is horrible and the CANON customer service is poor. Raised a dispute one week before and still waiting for the response. Attached a print quality comparison for better understanding. Right side is printed using HP P1108 and left side is printed using Canon MF232w. While registering the complaint, I mentioned the quality difference. That time the customer service executive told that do not compare the print quality with other printers. I don't understand how could he say that while the output from Canon MF232w is not understandable."
1,Item is faulty and fake cartridge inside. The printer shows a counterfeit cartridge message and doesn't print a single page. Very disappointed with Amazon. Expected better.
4,It‚Äôs easy to set up and start using.  Print quality  and speed is as expected.  Spend some time exploring it properly.If the colour printer was cheaper I‚Äôd have bought it.
5,"I was little confused before I order this printer. There's so many options available claiming to be best but I chose to buy this printer. Entirely satisfied. It's fast, print quality is brilliant, cost of printing is low. Anyone without 0 technical knowledge can install it."

4,good printer only issue is that it is not auto duplex printer . no slot for pen drive for scanning. as scanning can be done trough computer only
5,I took this printer and superb and nice features. Before buying this I had tried other printer very tough to install for both Mac and Windows 10. But this CANON Printer is superb easy to install for both Mac and Win
1,My  product is not operte in first timeSome technical issuesPlease solve this in urgency
5,"Very easy for use.Nice lookVery very good productWifi connection , scan, Xerox , very fast .Thank you Amazon..."
5,Copy is late and double paper insert
1,Print quality is very poor I raised the complaint & engineer gives me illogical reasoning saying being high speed printer my not print clear. I am really annoyed & want to return it!
5,This Covd19 times with children and work this printer is very handy. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
5,Good quality print .No delay in printing.Easy to use. Quality product. Timely delivery .
5,"I am using Canon for last many year and happy with Canon. This time I ordered WiFi model, but it is not working, may be I did not configure it properly, so I will contact canon customer support for this, hope it will be resolved on call only."
3,Every functionality (print/scan) works but quality isn't matching the brand name of Canon.
3,Expected a lot from a cannon but this printer seems to be very lame and not worth the money they are charging
3,In this model duplex print command not working properly in manually print. This is not a duplex printer. But manually duplex not working also.
5,Go for it! Both printing and scanning is good. Easy to print from phone. No need to talk about quality as it is a Canon's product.
4,"There is no dilike point noticed by me .Smooth running & paper printing quality good .After all ,I like this model."
4,"No duplex prinitingWifi setup is cumbersome.Rest all is good , print quality , print speed , low noise level and usb based setup is easy.Good product for home use."
5,Good
5,Good workigand printing getting good
5,The canon printer is very good and the printing
3,Printer is good but coustmer services very very bad no one come for installation after call
5,Extremely satisfied..
5,"Excelent Printer from Canon fast delivery, easy to use good print quality"
1,"This product does not even have a LAN port. It is completely misleading product description. I just wasted my 12,000 bugs in this useless machine. Unfortunately Amazon didnt honour return and I ended up keeping this useless product in my office."
5,"I have been racking my brains for the last few days since I received the printer to find a fault with the machine; disappointed that I cannot find any. This machine has more sophisticated functionality than I require for my limited home office needs; the two- sided scanning and printing, the two-sided scanning of Id cards and printing of both sides on a single page are some of features that I can think of. Kudos to Amazon to make it affordable to me via its red hot summer sale."
1,"The toner cant be refilled only replacement, its cost is Rs. 3500/- every time. Pathetic after sales support.Strictly dont buy this scrap."
4,"Lot of people are complaining that it doesn‚Äôt have wifi or LAN. For their information, the connectivity type is already mentioned, that is USB only. It‚Äôs a nice product in 11k price range."
5,Writing this after 8month usage product is good but tonor filling is not easy if you do your self u need assistance for tonor filling so in this range there is no wifi but i print with otg cable print quality is good i daily print a book product is fine but i will be disappointed by that there is no backlight on lcd which is bad
1,"The description doesn't say this cannot be connected to LAN which is a basic feature for a printer. This neither has WiFi nor the LAN port. It's just useless and Amazon cannot accept the return. Its waste of money, NEVER buy this useless printer."
3,"Product is good but its not yielding  as many prints as they mentioned, not even near by the number 2600. in my first full toner it yielded 1600 pages only.kindly provide me invoice bill once again."
5,Very good product.Auto-rotate feature.Easy Installation.Plug and print.
3,"Tldr: Printer is good, the software isn't great.Bought the printer for home use. It was very easy to install. The instruction manual was detailed and the instructions to download and install the drivers on Windows 10 were simple. Installs easily on MacOS also.Prints well, and is quite fast.The Interface to scan is not too great. It's easy if you want to scan a document into a pdf, but images are a bit complicated. It was easier on my old Canon Deskjet.Copy function doesn't work great with IDs. The photos usually end up with high contrast and black out at times. One workaround is to scan and then print.Overall, the printer is good if using primarily to print/scan documents."
5,I had this printer when I was in Canada. Hence I bought it here too. Amazing print quality as expected. Scanning and software installation is much easier. I have hp mx1130 laser jet. Compared to hp this is way better.
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
5,Very good product and fast delivery by Amazon and very good paking . product is too good than comparison. And lot's of options available in brother printer...thank you Amazon and thank you brother
4,"Excellent printer. Does the job. Consistent print quality and fairly easy to use. The parts feel made with fragile plastic but for the price I dont think I should complain.The only problem is the LCD display. It‚Äôs very hard to read the display and this is a real shame as this is the only ‚Äúuser interface‚Äù and I believe Brother should introduce a backlit display or something similar.The other disadvantage is that the software that comes with this printer (also available for download from the internet), is heavy and tends to make your computer very slow."
5,"If you require an easy to use, office like print operation and quality at affordable price, look no further, this is the printer for you. The installation was hasslefree, you can download drivers from the link provided in the manual and within 30 minutes the printer is installed. The cartridge drum has a orange locator and the manual has markings and depictions to help you place the toner cartridge in the cartridge drum. The entire process of setting up the printer was a smooth experience. Press the start button, press the print on the PC and the printer starts in a jiffy, the speed of printing is lightning fast and the two sided print happens automatically and seamlessly. Overall, the print quality and the print operation and installation is superb and plug and play. Have to test the scanner though. This is a very capable printer for a home office and can print in bulk and fast. Go for it."
1,worthless printer and seller distributed wrong information on amazon portal about wireless connection and product other features related.Please amazon check all details regarding products .i am not happy purchase this printer its just like a black marketing
5,"Setup is a breeze thanks to the included CD. If a CD/DVD drive is not available, then the drivers have to be downloaded from the Brother Support Website. The size is around 200MB.TIP: When choosing the printer model to download the drivers from their website, choose Asian Region and then select Indian Specific Models and you will find the drivers there."
3,"Hi, Overall a decent product in this price range. Using the same since last 10 days.Pros:Duplex printing2 side copy functionI'd copy functionPrint-Scan-Copy printerPrinting quality is obviously goodCons:No WiFi connectivity which is must in today secnerio as we recieve many documents on what's app.No LAN connectivity.No back-lit on information bar.If u are looking for budget friendly low maintainance printer for home or personal use in office then go for it. Keep looking for deals/ great festival days to avail extra cashback or instant discount to save Rs. 1K -1.2K."
5,Excellent printer for both home and office use. Crystal clear prints till now.very good printing speed.Overall highly recommended.
4,"So advantages are already mentioned so I am talking about it. What I observe is it requires a amt of space and also draws a large amt of current.. Another thing is that if using an extension box, even if the switch is off,due to large drawing of current you can get small shock if the laptop material is  metal... These are not the disadvantages but something you need to care about.The print quality is awesome and don't forget to register the product in brother site to check it's authenticity."
3,"Pros:Easy very good Black Prints and fast prints , dual side always a plus. ( Brother quality print are always good)Easy installation!Cons are no WIFI (Big-ve for today) , no EthernetStill you can make wifi prints via shared router, youtube if you want."
4,"Good printer in the price range with good features.Pros :-> Multi function - Print, Scan, Copy.> 2 in 1 - ID card copy is great feature.> Auto Duplex saves the any day.Cons :-> Too slow to initiate the print. ( i.e. transfer of content from computer to printer ).> Copy quality is decent."
5,"Overall a good printer.  I had some initial set up issues.  Could not control the contrast and the darkness of the prints.  Learning the ID printing and dual page printing techniques were a bit involved.  It took a few attempts to get them right.These features were very useful and most used.  I am quite satisfied with this printer now.  I do not know the support available for this printer in India, but let us hope that I do not need one. :-)"
2,"After going through lot of reviews, I had decided to buy this printer. The printer no doubt worked like a charm exactly for 1 year 10 days. Just after that I started getting an error on the display. 0B. I am not sure if it was my bad luck or the printer itself had a life span of 1 year which is it's actual warranty.  After contacting the brother support, When I told about the error, they said it costs Rs.5000üò£. He said the chip is gone bad. So expensive to get it repaired. Not happy with the durability of the product. 1 year and it's dead. Better to buy from local shop. They will at least try to support us. But online it's waste to buy such expensive electronic products."
5,I was using this printer since last one year....good printer. No doubt....I have done many big printing job on this printer up to 10000 pages per day.. without any issue...with refill tonner .one tonner refill can print 3-4000 print with toner save mode....after that much of printout i changed drum ...not all drum unit just drum..and its works ..Recently i print 7000 pages in one day ....still printer working fine...i run cyber cafe .so i have very hard use..
5,"It's the most amazing printer at this price, I've been using laser printers since 94, the beg. Era of printers, but brother has simply outclassed HP etc, just don't, think twice , if u wanna have monochrome printing needs."
5,Got this for home use. It does exactly as it says and the printer is rather fast than the printers I have used before. The duplex printing facility is also very helpful.
4,Price print quality it's ok but display have not visible no back light .direct print fast .but using from computer  its take first scanning then Printing take too much time.for 10 print its take 8 minutes . I am not satisfied with this  I am RETURN  I am buy little more price  around 20000 .
4,"Product is easy to install, like the duplix option. Worth for money at this price scanner,copiers,prrinter ,duplex printing are great, however the status pannel lighting is very dull and software for scanner needs some improvements. No complaints ,so for working great"
5,"I am fan of brother products since last 12 year first i bought only laser jet with tonner it printed 2600 copy in single tonner , in monsoon this printer dont spread ink like other printers do , never heat and auto updated driver"
5,"It's a mind blowing fantastic printer for office and business use,  print quality is excellent,  and duplex printing add extra advantage to this printer,  double side printing is awesome,  everything is goodCon--- it needs good maintaince,  so use properly,  don't play game with it, I mean don't take it lightly,It's not working in inverter,  if you still use using high power inverter then may be internal parts damages"
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice.i have been using this product from amazon from almost 7 months,any kind of problem not shown till date .everybody who looking for printer should buy this effective product from amazon."
5,"Brother printer is good,"
5,Nice printer. Good build and economical.So just go for it. Working perfectly fine.Change the setting to save ink high brightness and low contrast. Easy to use.Ready to use
2,"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.3. LCD - DIM SO NOT READABLE EASILY4. INVOICE RECEIVED, IS NOT LEGIBLE AND NOT COMPLETE."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
5,"If I have to rate this product across all catagories on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it 9 out of 10. Delivery was well in time as it appeared at the time of ordering it. Quality of the printer and print is great in its class. It is indeed a product with good value for money. I am completely satisfied with this laser printer so far."
2,Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review.  It won't print 2000 copies
2,It's display is so poor... We can't see things in its display properly. They also didn't provide return or replacement. software installation is also a difficult task as the cd along with it won't run.We have to go to the website and download it.Overall Printing quality is good.
1,"It has been mentioned on the printer itself that 2600 pages minimum it would print, however, it was able to print only 2000 pages. i am suprised on seeing the differences."
4,Since last 5 years am using Brother Printers .i am telling simply its Pretty hardworker.... But its very impossible to get  Customer care support  .. I tried and installed myself ....
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
4,Photo is somewhat blurr but it's ok üëå
5,A good printer...one who wants only printing with wifi facility..go for it...i bought at 8819rs..any personal query can be entertained..thanks
5,"I bought two of these. Wanted a simple laser printer that had wifi connectivity. Setup was easy, print quality is good. It takes very less space on desk due to its compact design. Make sure that the first setup is done by connecting it to the computer else it ends up configuring it's wireless profile and it takes a setting reset to reconfigure and add it to the network. If you are confused between inkjets and laser, think about how many color prints you need and take a call. If you are going to just print blacks usually. This one is the best option."
3,"I initially purchased this printer for basic home use as well as to print PCB designs, However this printer jams on transparencies and 200GSM paper 90% of the time even after selecting 200GSM in printer settings, didn't expect this from HP as it says in the manual this printer can print on OHP transparencies the print quality isn't great on transparencies when it happens to not jam. also the vertical scaling on this printer is unreliable and it causes an issue for large PCB designs as sometimes it prints the PCB 1-3mm longer vertically (the same pdf prints different sizes vertically so it is 100% a printer issue), however horizontal size is spot onpros: the black is really jet black and it prints very fast, i can print a 10 page 2 sided document in less than 40 secondscons: the printer mostly jams easily on some types of paper, it cannot print properly on transparencies and the HP mobile app doesn't allow you to change the size of of the print when printing from a phone so a small picture takes the full a4 paperi also own a canon E500 inkjet printer and i cannot remember the last time any type of paper jammed in the canon, however this HP printer jams on thick or glossy papers extremely easily."
2,Before purchasing this printer keep in mind you'll have to pay around 4000 plus rupees on a single cartridge. Rather than buying this for 10k you should go for the 14k printer from hp the never stop printing variant so as to to drastically reduce the cost of refill and also for a bigger output (5000 pg as opposed to 1500 with this one). Furthermore when buying this understand that the cartridge which they provide at the first purchase runs out at only 500 pages. Sadly I found it out too late to return the product. So my two cents go for another printer.
5,Buy it only if you do not want support from HP. As it says this product is no longer serviced by HP on the official support website.
1,Not able to find cartridge. HP original one is very costly.
3,Nice printed does the job efficiently for printing normal copies. But if your a amazon seller and thinking about printing labels then I wouldn't recommend it as it doesnt print the label correctly. It always misses the alignment
5,"The Product is superb. Print quality is awesome since it is a laserdesk.Only issue is that the WPS pin number is not provided anywhere for printing it through wireless connection in a laptop. You need to first install the drivers whic is a one time process after which the prints are flawless through laptops. For mobile, you need to download the HP Smart app and have to be connected through PRINTER'S WIFI for giving the printout."
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing. HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A..."
2,It‚Äôs only good if you are planning to print 10-20 pages a day. My workload is around 100+ pages a day. I just used once a it was getting heated and also after 30 odd pages it produces smoke !! If you are looking for high volume then buy those heavy printers. Also Carterage is pricy.
5,"Printer was easy to install. I am using this printer at my home for the past 6 months in a wireless manner. So far, the print quality is good and I haven't faced any difficulty during my printing."
5,What a printer for home use like for kids project and assist to avoid to give mobile to kids which notes comes from whatsapp. Excellent wifi can print from any room.
5,"Very good printer for home and small office purpose.  Easy to configure to wifi network from windows computer but  not from MacBook. Once you configure it for Wifi. then you forget all cable, you can print anything from any gadget or computer through the same wifi network. Very good print quality and can be configure for economic prints."
3,"Writing it after wasting my 6 hours.Good build quality, easy to print with phone but you can do very little customisation with your documents while print,by using Phone. Easily get connected with phone. But to do more customisation with your documents you need a PC or a laptop. And getting connected with laptop, that's too wireless is a hell of work. You have to download file from HP website which is very pathetic. You might easily get connected using USB cable, but remember you are paying 2000 extra for the wireless facility. So If you are not easily get connected,then what is the point of paying extra. It would be better if you go for 108a , less price, same quality just the wireless facility will be absent there."
4,Value for money.... only issue is it takes time to wake up from sleep mode....
4,"Good  wifi Printer so far, not that easy plug and play you need to download the required software in your cellphone and laptop to do air prints. Also, it consumes a good amount of 350watts of electricity. Print quality is Okish serve the purpose only not great like inkjet."
1,"Printouts from the beginning were mot very sharp, unlike what a laser production should be like. Then spots started appearing. When I had it independently examined, I was told that it had a faulty drum assembly. This is not expected of a brand new HP product."
1,"Quality is poor.Only connecting on Bluetooth.Whenever connect the cable it shows printer offline.Printing speed is very slow ie preparation for printing is slow ,once ready for printing then speed is fine.Both side printing is practically of no use."
1,"1. Print quality : good2. Easy to install : No if you are using WiFi direct.3. Easy to use : No. many times, it says printer not available. You need to manually connect to WiFi direct.  It take 5 seconds to start printing from mobile device.4. Total pages you can print : 1200 pages.5: No auto duplex6: printer cause power fluctuations in my home when we start it."
2,The ink powder is released out like a smokey mist every time for the first page. No ink mist for consecutive second third ..... Only for every first page.....This is a health hazard!!!!!!
5,Fantastic network printer solving the printing needs during WFH for school and office.If I have to nitpick somehow the network printing is a bit slower to start.Very very easy to install and so long it is in wifi range can be installed anywhere
5,The printer does the job. However it looks very fragile (when compared to my earlier Xerox laser printer)
1,"I bought this product in April, it worked well for first 1000 pages and then I get it cartidge refilled, it works good for next 1000 pages and after that I get it cartidge refilled again and now its starts giving Fully Black Paper, it got drum issue. I won't recommend anyone to buy this product, its not worth at all."
3,The print out quality was okay. The issues is that I could not connect it with the wifi. Amazon support also could not help and hence had to return.
1,"Havent been able to connect the printer to wifi and no help from HP either. have tried using macbook, windows laptop and iphone mutiple times. waste of money paying for wifi."
5,"Very easy to install and it's really compact. As it is wireless, don't worry about so many cables on your table. Installing an app helps to to print from your smart phone."
4,Very good printer and easy to install.HP smart app make it very easy to print from mobile.dual side printing is not available is the only drawback.
1,Can't install on Ubuntu distributionAlso wifi direct is not stable
3,Average printer. Toner cartridge is rarely available.
1,Unable to print. Printer was getting warm on connecting with electricity. And wifi connection not working. So return it.
5,I liked the product so much...it was just like as advised
1,"Extremely bad quality printing, got some issue within 10 days ,I returned it.üò•üò°"
5,"Good print quality, after installation very easy to use, printing from mobile via wifi is very easy and time efficient"
5,Perfect for home use and if you don't need color print. Using print from phone option is great.
5,Good product
5,It was easy to setup with Wi-Fi router having WPS option and the print quality is good and fast as well.
5,"Hassle free printing system. At this cost, I found it to be the best thing. Very compact in size. Initially you might face difficulty in installation. It's better to call hp and get installation support. They do it with remote connection."
4,"No support for HP Smart App for Mac. Paper jams occur frequently if printing papers are not placed ""precisely"". Print quality is superb. However, getting this printer to do the printing is a tedious process."
5,"It Didn't took much time to install. Print quality is excellent. It can print via usb, wifi direct and wireless as well. I am happy with it"

5,"I like this printer for business in rural area.It can print legal. I had all ready use before.How to install?Remove seal plastic outside and inner part.Insert ink to Ink Tank. And plug to power to 240v.Select language, press 3seconds to complete ink setup. It will take 11 minutes after completing. Printer is ready to print,scan.Print quality is great. You can adjust ink in destiny.Easy to print and copy. Just load paper in tray. And start copy."
1,Printer not working since receipt. No response from either manufacturer Epson or on-line supplier Amazon
5,Cheapest on Amazon..... working beautifully since 6 months without issues. 50 to 60 prints daily with 4-5 copy jobs... ink printing is on par with lazer printer... Delivery before time with good fragile packing....
1,"This printer is making me in trouble everyday.  When service person unable to rectify the defect in the printer.  Can you replace the same with anothe rsame type  printer, if any difference in cost will be paid by me.  Kindly revert."
1,"After ordering the printer didn't work. Ordered a replacement on the same day. however, the amazon number provided hasnt been picking up for the last 4 days. Seems a scam is running during lockdown!!!"
4,Nice and efficient printer....though it doesn't have its own wifi..but still after connecting to Wi-Fi modem you can make use of wireless scanning and printing which is just awesome. Slightly delicate product so keep our safe in cover so as to keep it away from dust. Drivers are not available as of now for MacBook pro but fully compatible with Windows.Overall 4 and half stars.
5,Print quality is too good and more good features  ...
5,Now I am the proud owner of this long coveted printer. It was my dream to possess an Epson printer. Using this for 3-4 days. It's excellent.
5,The printer has very easy installation process......and the best part is the printing cost effectiveness. Good printer for home purpose of you want to print regular basis.
1,Worrest service from Epson .with in 5months the carriage belt was damaged and customer service is not responding to my request by telling so many reasons.
1,We have received use products it's warrnti already started from Feb
5,if you want printer for office work ie:black printing only go for itcheapest printing gives 6000-8000pages once refilled
1,"Spent around 14K went as waste, did not print even 200 Pages in a year. Head not working, power problem just after expiry of Warranty. It is total WASTE of Money. Never thought EPSON product will be of so lowgrade."
4,The overall performance is satisfactory. Always use paper of 80 gsm or above. Else multiple papers will stuck while printing.
1,"Printing is working fine but Adf is not working properly,facing paper jam issue all the time after purchasing the product"
3,Compare other brand printers build quality is Cheap and delicate and it is  time taking to take photo copy and add also takes time but I bought this for only one reason even though it is bit slower but I bought it because of zero maintenance in two months paper jammed for 2 times and it is pretty easy to remove and as of now I haven't faced any problem........
3,We were looking for the colour printer and were disappointed more over it doesn't has wifi connectivity too ...We didn't check for all these details and the cost of the printer with color printing as well as without wifi connectivity is not worth it's value
5,"I love Epson So I have Bought This ,Again Epson Gave Me A Great Experience,  Product is nice, easy to install , fast and efficient printing."
5,"GOOD PRONT QUALITY, AND PHOTO COPY. EASY TO OPERATE."
4,serviceis poor in kerala at kollam

4,"It's just white and black printer ,"

1,Video Player is loading.
4,Good
5,It is simply superbBut for my product the cable wire is looseWhich makes it power off always
5,A very high quality printer with scanner and photocopy..  Value for money
5,"Order for restaurant billing and Kot printingWorks like a charmBranded printer in budget.Easy to install, and use printer i have used till date"
1,Paper sensor was missing in the product
5,"locally purchased product, easily installable product with USB Lan ports. i have also connected cash drawer (tilt) for automation. works well, speed is hilarious.  best printer in 3 inch printing range. backed by posiflex USA based company,"
5,Print Quality and printer is very good. But its ink is a bit costly ‚Çπ840 ink a single cartigate would print approx. 900 A4 pages. Its ink capacity is double. ‚Çπ1440 double 103A ink is used when it is completely empty.Also check its warranty while registering on HP website mine was 2 months older. Means it was registered two months before I bought it. Also while registering on HP website for warranty invoice was to be uploaded but in Amazon's invoice hp printer serial number was not mentioned so I had problems to extend and register my printer for warranty.
4,Easiy ink installation but ink cost high üò¢ and OP quality with WiFi
5,Warranty registration on hp website is hectic process otherwise printer is good
5,"It is awesome product, print quality is good and it was easy to install"
5,Installation is required for functioning and printing.
3,Not bad
1,Not canact
1,Don't install
5,OK
2,"I bought this in the year November 2019, let me tell you at first everything was smooth, good print quality, fast printing, quantity of output was very good but within 3rd month the print started fading up dyue to roller issue, then the refilling was expensive. But the roller problem never solved, if the company is providing a tank the roller should have better longevity but then the scanner also not working. Please also note if a single unit in the printer is not working the wify will not work too."
3,"Nice printer.Scaning and printing through pc or laptop is normal.But through the smart phone, its irritating while scanning process started via hp smart app. And printing both side of ID card output becomes not side by side, its output be up and down in a page. One more difficult is to register extended warranty through website. Its little bit confused with options given on the form. Note that the Invoice bill will appear on our Email.not with the product.Thank you all"
5,Very easy to use awesome print quality light weight and very fast.
5,Restaurant billing essay to help
5,I can easily print from my phone. Awesome experience with using this thermal printer in my home. quality is very good. Happy now
4,"Hi All, after lot of research on web, i had finalized this printer however it is not worth. it has stopped working post 20 pages of document and there is not proper support available for this in india. Careful .Update: was able to reach out and it required me to replace the toner and after which things are very much working. Therefore have revised my rating."
1,"I brought this printer and used only two day and print around 7-8 pages only after printer stopped working. technical team checked and observed its showing error due to any defect of internal board. Its really very bad experience with a largest known brand of the world,.... i feel very disappointed....."
3,"I have purchased this printer just because of printer  brand and more about use of Wifi functionality. But There are some critical things which make this printer too COSTLY!Pros:-Easy Setup on Windows10 with Driver installation.-Easy setup of WiFi from driver and print for PC.-Good print Quality-Good print speed-portableCons:-Default Printer cartridge is duplicate and has capacity of 700printing pages, mine got finished at 518prints.-""Original Printer cartridge"" has min capacity of 1500 printing pages.-Default Printer cartridge has no genuine serial no not showing in PC information page.-Printer registration is not done on official website, this make doubt of duplication of product.-No mobile WiFi printing, even after installing mobile App.-No Refill powder and chip available anywhere easily. So every time need to buy new CLONE cartridge which is too costly(1.2K).-Original Xerox cartridge is very Costly(4k-5K).-Service issuesSo in conclusion if print coast is not affordable then Wifi functionality is useless and it is better to purchase standard laser printer with toner refill capability, which makes it affordable even without WiFi."
5,"Working all fine. Compact, doesn‚Äôt need much space to keep. Easy operability. Just on/off button & Wifi button. Very easy to set up. But need a laptop or computer to set up even though it‚Äôs WiFi printer. Works well with ipad. Print quality is good & speed of printing is fast. Less noisy as compared to Canon Inktank printers. Using it for last 1 month, no issues so far. Don‚Äôt know how long the cartridge lasts."
1,"Printer is very good in all respect, print quality is mind blowing & well speed. BUT THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR REFILLING OF CATRIDGE. AFTER 200 PRINTOUT CATRIDGE TONER IS FINISHED. WHEARAS HP PRINTER PRINTOUT CAPACITY IS 800 to 1000 & SUBSTITUTE CARTRIDGE EASILY AVAILABLE IN MARKET IN A ECONOMICAL PRICE UNDER RS.600 BUT XEROX SUBSTITUTE CATRIDGES RATES ARE VERY HIGH & THERE IS ALSO CHIP SYSTEM.  IN THIS GROUND PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS NOT A WISE DECESION.If the manufacturing company solve toner related problems then it will be a great printer for ever."
5,Extremely high quality.Easier to use as it has a much higher quality and simpler physical body than Canon and Samsung.The quality of printing is excellent.The cartridge is very easy to remove and replace.Mobile and cloud prints are possible with WiFi connectivity.  It is easy to handle as it is small in size and light in weight.
4,>Best priced Wi-Fi Laser printer> Does not print directly from Mobile or Pad> Cloud supported but host system to kept connected all time> Wi-Fi direct (without internet) Print work flow less> Manual back to back print
1,"Works with AirPrint from an iPad, but comes with Google cloud print disabled. Inadequate support from Xerox, and none from Google. The first tells you to go to Google help, the second tells you to contact the manufacturer. The customer ends up in a spin with a half-useless device. Very disappointing."
1,Price keeps on lowering . I felt cheated. Good product with excellent features but low quality print.
5,"Really Easy to Set up.Just to follow user guide given with Set.Gives excellent quality printout just from Any where like i-pad,Phones,Laptop etc.Good product in very nice Price.Must buy for every small office & homes.Small size so easy to keep anywhere."
1,Wireless printing is not enabled. No support is available.
1,Worst printer in the world..  plz don't buy it... In that no options to refill .... Every time HV to buy cartridge it will not refilled...
2,"Wireless setup issue still persists, please DONOT buy this as neither Amazon nor Xerox will help you. Xerox technical team doesn't have technical knowledge about this printer and they kept dragging me for months. At last, they say there some other issue with my wifi setup."
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money every time toner chip error problem Every one chip single us only 300 copy s  it cost 500 in market 300 pages print after the toner empty then replace the chip the service executive not available in this mission Mission
3,There is no clear instructions for how to connect with Mobile to direct print from mobile
1,"Used the printer for about 20 days now and its showing toner remaining 53%, moreover it just dont connect to Wifi over mobile however laptop wifi works fine.....Overall very much disappointed with the purchase."
5,Printing is fine but wifi configuration is a hazzle
1,"Absolute nuts to buy this printer worth only for 10$, spoiling the Xerox brand"
1,This product does not work and also to return the product they don't  respond  to the mails. Nothing prints on the papers.Do not buy this product.
1,this is chip system toner and its refilling cost too high
2,Initial 2 days it was working fine. Later it had problem of paper sticking. Returned
3,"Printer showing out of cartridge only after 150-200 prints, worst laser printer, wifi not configured"
3,Poor print but easy
1,Wifi is an issue doesn't connect
5,Best performance
4,Initially it takes time to print and its little noisy
5,Best price & best quality
1,"Looks like used printer, got black stains all over the printer, cartridge not recognizing by printer."
1,The printer is not working after the first few prints.
1,Worst product
5,Superb in quality and speed....im using it with great satisfaction
4,Average
1,Not a user friendly product. Wi fi app also purshched.
4,Very nice product....Prints more pages in less ink...
1,very bad experience
4,"When I print a copy, then  less quality"
5,Excellent printer
5,I love this product
5,Good pdt
5,Good product..
5,EASY TO INSTALL AND GOOD PRODUCT
1,Got damage and old one
4,"Using it for past few weeks.Pros:Good print quality. Simple installation- USB or WiFi option. Can print from all devices including mobile device connected to the WiFi, when configured for WiFi.Cons: Minor cons. Sometimes have delay in mobile device linking to the Printer by WiFi. The small LCD Display not backlit, difficult to read in low light.Overall, good printer for home or home office use."
5,"I purchased this item for home use. I was using HP Desk jet All in One printer and fed up with refilling and changing its cartridge, where it was dry out quickly ; realized it was a wrong item purchased. I gave that item to someone who can manage its cartridge better. This time I was looking for just a printer (no color, no all in one) with wifi support (As I wanted to make sure that I can connect from mobile devices) with auto duplex support and least operating cost. My search ended in monochrome laser printer (black and white) and then picked up Brother brand. I got this printer with discount, so its value for money.Advantages I can see -- Cartridges easily available, cost is less than 2000 and can print upto 3000 pages. This is far better than HP printers in cost wise.- Paper tray will hold paper inside, there is no need to open and put paper for print and its completely closed.- Very nice printout, no sound while printing and very fast.- I can print from Laptop and Mobile.Its Wifi setup was difficult, it took about three hours for me to complete the setup. The reason, the CD that came with this printer wasn't reading, hence I had to download its drivers. Plus wifi setup was bit tricky. After doing initial setup from Laptop print from mobile wasn't coming.Here is the tip, once you have Brand new printer, you can contact Brother support, they will provide installation and demo free of cost. I called Brother support, the support person visited my place and addressed the issue quickly. Print from mobile too work.I've also compared HP laser jetss, they have world's smallest laser printer, but that doesn't support auto duplex (double side printing). That's small, but then there is no covered paper tray, hence you will have to open and manage paper overtime you want prints. None of the laser printers in this price range from HP or Canon supports auto duplex mode.Overall a very good product. If you feel you choose a laser printer with full duplex support; this is the best one low cost. All other laser printer cost higher."
1,UI not user friendly.Connection to WIFI was very difficult. Kept on disconnecting on Android.For Apple OK.Only photos can be sent via WiFi for print ...no docu support.
1,Worst Printer. Cartiage Error problem happened after 1 print only.
5,"I had a Canon inkjet printer which I'd bought 6 years ago and had an ink tank installed. Turns out inkjet printer cartridges get clogged if you don't use them frequently enough. So the savings from the ink tank against cartridges went back into buying new cartridges. Time for a laser printer, then.Zeroed in on this Brother laser printer now after reading several reviews and watching several youtube videos. Waited a few days to get a good price as the price kept fluctuating every 2 days. Finally bought it for 10,499 - a very good deal, I believe.Been using it for a month and a half and so far, extremely happy with the performance and print quality. Prints are sharp and quick. No smudging, no streaking.Adding it to a new PC is extremely easy. Switch it on and let Windows search for it in ""Add a printer"" settings. Pairs within seconds. No drivers needed to be installed.Printing wirelessly via the phone app is a bit slow. Printing from a PC is fast though. Haven't measured the print per minute since I need to take 4-5 prints at a time.The wireless & auto-duplex functions were the main attraction for me. I thought about buying one with a scanner, but Microsoft Lens app is a good enough document scanner now.Overall, this printer gets a 5* rating from me."
5,"Very easy to install. Simple wifi setup. Prints well...no issues so far, using for sometime now. Good printing speed. Worth buying"
5,"After comparing lots of printers online, I bought it for ‚Çπ10713 and I like the following features that no other brand provides in this price rangeAuto duplex printing,Wifi connectivity,Paper holding tray"
5,"There is nothing to dislike about. Everything great.Lots of features liki wifi printing, https support for admin, auto duplex mode, lots of protocols supported. Easily compatible on linux as well.Tray capacity is brilliant. No of prints per cartridge is high i.e. 3000.After 140 print prints toner is not even 1% less."
5,"Nice printer, works flawlessly through Wifi. Auto duplex printing is a useful feature. Printer tray enables u to use the printer directly without the need for loading the paper every time u require printing. At this price, you hardly get the above two features in any other OEM's printer.. print quality is very good, no smudges or paper jams till now. Quite silent printing as well. Only one thing of critique, the installation may have some glitches as the password provided on the side sticker isn't accepted by the software while updating.. but otherwise, very satisfied with the purchase."
4,"I find it wonderful to print over wifi from my laptop as well as my mobile phone.It is difficult to type in the wifi password using the few keys available. But once configured, its fine. The quick start menu is not very helpful at setting up the network."
5,Best at the price. Initial setup may seem a little difficult with a small LCD screen and limited buttons.But after that you are free from worries.Mobile printing makes the life real easy with this.
5,Pros:1. On common lan Wifi print is nice.2. Duplex feature.3. Call support .Cons1. Direct print  doesnot print documents but only images2. Print facility from watsapp should also be there.
5,"I was surprised by how easy it was to use the product. Installation was no problem and print commands were easy to give from an android phone, iphone and PC. iPhone needed no installation of anything ay all. The best feature is the paper tray that goes in all the way. We love it !"
5,This is the best value for money laser printer in 11k that has auto duplex feature i.e. prints on both sides as well as has wifi feature. Neither hp nor canon has those in 11k. Was easy to install using videos given on YouTube. Print quality was great. Till now printed more than 2500 pages using toner given.
4,"Product is good and handy as of date. Installation took some time as the exact model was not showing in their driver support page which was mentioned in the installation guide, hence had to search on the net for same. But once done all has been working well. Hope the same continues."
5,wow very nice collity
5,"Best quality product with budjet price, print quality also quite good, can command by direct mobile devices"
5,Good printer. Value for money.
5,"Like the packing. Prospect of installing the printer is daunting.Will you arrange for a technician to install? Easy to install. You are a great company!No better company, nor printer.P.ranganathan IRS (Retd)"
5,Excellent Printer...
4,Printer is very good...installation can be done easily by the chart provided with the printer...you can go ahead with this printer..it's been few days and printer working with wifi perfectly...
5,Very Fast..Easy to Install..Print quality Excellent...Auto Duplex Page printing very fast and wonderful..
5,Great printer. Don‚Äôt have to think twice before buying this one.
5,Working well on my mobile phones and Windows laptops!
4,"Good Printer. First couple of times had difficulty in reliability of WiFi connection. Manual was an older model one. But, website videos were helpful in installation."
4,"Nice product, does its work well"
4,"Good product , print quality is descent, almost as per with HP"
5,Brother has always been my favorite printer compared to other brands. Hoping for better after sales service.
5,Please see a few videos on how to connect to network for WiFi printing. WiFi printing works well over mobile and PC.
5,I have not used it as often to wrote but few prints i get side black band- i cannot get hold of the customer service yet
4,Installation is not that easy for WiFi connection. Print quality is not so good. It is bit costly as compared to hp
4,Every good things you read here is true except printing speed ..it's bit slow..than they have mentioned.Bt still worthy.
5,Best product in this price.....
5,Very good
5,It is a good product because its installation is so easy and it has sums issus when conner to wi fi it is print so fast
5,Nice  and awesome product easy to useAnd nice quality.  Product is not really nice but still the best  .
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services.

5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.

But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.

Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."

4,It is black and white printer. We can't connect to wifi and do wireless printing. It should be connect to at least one pc so that we can give print. Use google cloud print to print wireless. Overall experience with it is best.
4,"Warning! This printer does not have a built-in wireless adapter/radio. It does, however, have an Ethernet port. This means that you must connect an Ethernet cable from the printer to your network hardware (ex. a wireless router) in order for the printer to be accessible on your home/office network. This point was a bit ambiguous in the product description on both Amazon's and HP's sites. It would be easy for a buyer to think that it is a wireless printer, when that is not the case. Luckily, my wireless router happens to be in close range of my printer, so crisis averted :)Note: The"
4,Works as advertised this does not have WiFi option you need to connect to a network through a cable.

3,"Somewhat ok, not that good. And on hp official website it is available for rs. 21,700/-, here 29,900/-, what a difference."
4,Super fast printing. Negative is that it does not support double side printing automatically but manually flip is possible after all one side is printed. Easy to print two sides once understood.

Initially was having trouble setting up the wireless printing, thought that was the product's defect, but HP was prompt enough to send their engineer to resolve the issue. It was nothing related to the product, only a set up issue. Absolutely happy !!!!"

5,"very nice product,same as described"
4,"This Zebra printer could be the best, if they start providing local support.Currently, Zebra has an international support, it worked for us, but that might not good enough for most of the other. Please note that Zebra's international support is better than some so-called local support, though. It has a toll-free international number, That's also good.Everything else is good. I'd say Zebra's Label designer software is basic and things gets done nicely for most people, and it's better than BarTender Label making software.  Because BarTender is a heavy software and most people don't require enterprise level of features. Although, you can use BarTender with this printer as well.I think, we got our printer from their old stocks. Amazon should improve their packaging for the electronic items.Zebra has a good ecosystem, that is a plus thing for some users. If you get some good deal on this than you can definitely consider this over TSC, TVS etc."
1,"Worst product, it stopped working within 10 days of purchase and the Company rejected to fix it stating that ‚Äúit‚Äôs an online purchase, so not covered under warranty‚Äù"
4,"A distribution sales office where I previously worked was my first hands on experience with Dot Matrix printers.Having used only inkjet & Lazerjet printers all my school and college life which gave fast & clear prints, a slow dot matrix printer was like a vintage car to me.But after having printed my first sales bill which required 3 copies per bill (Original, Duplicate for transporter & triplicate for accounts) it struck me that commercial printing on a daily basis is a massive cost and only dot matrix printers can minimize the hole in your pocket.So when i started my trading business the first thing i bought was the Epson LX-310.Epson is a reliable brand in the printing industry so i gave this no second thought.The printer works like a charm and can also print on 4 sided paper if required.Print speed is decent.. I use a three sided paper which has carbons in the middle and it takes about 20 seconds for a full GST Invoice print from Tally.Setup.. Heres where this is tricky as I am using 3 sided paper the initial lining up of the paper has to be precise to avoid wastage and ensue accurate prints. Invest the little extra time to understand the setup process to ensure peaceof mind and low costs in the future.Maintenence.. I have been using the printer for over two years now and it has never electrically faulted. The only thing you have to do is keep changing the ribbon in the printer when your prints appear less dark. I simply have a tie up with my local stationary man who replaces it for me when ever needed on a cost effective contract basis.In conclusion it is a great product which should be purchased by individuals or firms who need over 30-40 prints on a daily basis. The. Long term cost efficiency of this slightly expensive machine is what dot matrix is all about.IF YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW USEFUL, PLEASE HIT THE HELPFUL BUTTON UNDER THIS REVIEW.Happy Printing..- Gills Guide."
1,"I have reasons to give this a one star. The product seems fine, print quality is decent. I would have given the product a 4 easily. Its the service from Epson why I am giving this a one. We are having issues with installation, setting up the printer to print correctly etc. but Epson India is not available to provide proper service or make a office visit. Feels helpless when companies behave like this. Also another issue, Epson Toll Free number says this machine cannot get an extended warranty or AMC like its other products."
5,Epson dot matrix are the best. I had been using Epson for almost a decade. Great product and good price too from Amazon
5,One of the most successful printer. I have 8 units working for me 10 hours a day. They let your maintenance cost cut down.
1,There are wrong reviews about this product. It does not suport network based printing. I opened the box 2 months after delivery. Any chance of return? It's totally unused.

2,"Delivered seal opened product, these days I am seeing these type issues with amazon"
1,Not even a cardboard box for 15k worth product? Could not even imagine of it's journey from Kolkata to South India. Almost the top was open which was stick with home cello tape like one.  Highly disappointed for this careless attitude. Need to test if the printer is really new and still working!!!Note: Few moments later I notice that the warranty was activated last month itself when checked in HP website. That unfolds the story.
4,Overall it was an easy self installation and the print quality and print speed is as expected and solve the purpose for home use. The WiFi direct setup was done easily and prints well but the setup for WIFi with router is documented as simple 2 lines step but somehow is not working properly and need some better detailing.HP certainly wins my bet ahead of Epson and Canon after all my initial research.
4,"516 is good printer with good quality prints and WiFi printing is a breeze using iOS.The build quality could have been better, paper inlet tray is flimsy and the outlet tray is very small hence papers fly out of the tray after printing.Overall printing is goodBuild quality is below mark compared to epson printers."
1,Multiple follow up for installation but there is no sucess.The technician assigned is super busy and never call you back. I  afraid how can they support when there is an issue in the printer.. Poor support
2,"Think before buying.. I feel like I have wasted alot of money on this product. The print quality is best. The product is nice. But I feel like the description is misleading, it will not print more than 500 black and white pages for the ink provided by the company. Please don't buy it if you print less than 50 pages a month. You will be wasting alot of money on such unnecessary product."
3,"I researched and finalised this product because of Hp brand over other brand products which are available with better quality and less price. It does the job to print with all features mentioned, print quality is average. Total 6 ink(3 different colours and 3 black bottles) is plus point. Works well with HP mobile app( note additional hp plugin app required other than main HP print app). Print quality not good even at best setting. Brother and epson mention better quality on paper.HP support was good, got installation person visit on same day after asking on hp request link.I am personally disappointed with hardware build quality of this product as top scan cover is too filmsy, not sure how long it will last.There are other better product from brother, canon available but not sure about their services.I called/mailed hp support to get warranty start date corrected.Overall, ok product and not value for money with rating 2.5/ 5PS: rejected first product as delivery box damaged and second product was replacement after multiple requests on customer. Amazon disappointed there."
5,Recently bought hp smart tank 516 printer. Built quality is quite good. You get very simple instruction manual very easy to follow. Filling the ink tanks to printing was very easy. After downloading the application n connecting with printer via wifi was quite good. Took some document prints as well as photo print on photo paper. Both were good. So far impressive. Need to see how much print can be taken with the given ink.
4,"Printer & scanner quality is good enough. But it does not have a stable WiFi connection. Everytime it goes to sleep mode, it disconnects.Another problem is -- it has no option to connect to a hidden wifi network (if you've hidden your SSID)."
5,"The printers comes with the ink tank integrated, which reduces the footprint of the device. The printers are compact and are designed to fit better in homes. The HP Smart Tank comes packed with ink supplies in the box that are said to give an output of a minimum of 6000 pages (black) and 8000 pages (colour) and are said to be 38% faster. The printers can be connected to mobile via dual-band Wi-Fi and HP Smart mobile print app and Bluetooth LE."
2,"The print quality is OK, installation was a breeze..After using it for 3 months, I feel frustrated, As the printer is not as per my expectations.First of all I cannot load more than 1 sheet, If I put more than 1 sheet the printer gets struck.So you end up losing lot of time loading the papers.If you want to print only one sheet, then it takes quite lot of time (2 to 3minutes to take in the paper).Overall I'm not at all happy with this product. I regret buying this printer..."
2,"If you ever need a printer which is difficult to install, difficult to get the proper settings, slow to start up, slow to print out, creates one issue or another after every page you print with either paper mismatch /printer busy info and a host of other issues which you have to trouble shoot everytime after you print a page, then you have FOUND the perfect product. I am stuck with it. Want someone else to also suffer this torture!"
1,"Even company rejected my previous Review, so reposting again. The print speed as claimed us false ink head type printer can never be so fast. Lower build quality, suitable only for students or small quantity work. Shall not buy again, I returned it"
1,"Have called HP and they spend a couple of hours remotely and they re-install too much software but were not able fix it.  When the HP support team conclude the call he said will get back to you in few hours. After 2 days also no action from HP. I am using HP Computer, laptop and printer but still same OEM products are not working and the support team is not able to solve. So guys think 100 times before buying HP Products. HP support request no #5070827688"
1,"I Ordered this product on 3rd Oct 2021 and received after 2 days and i requested for installation in HP.After one day i got call from HP engineer and he came for installation. He opened the box and after primary setup he tried to connect the power supply and first time only got some noise inside head and loud and E03 error displayed.Very Vey unstaisfied, First time i am experiencing this in AMAZON...Attached HP Engineers updated in the pack.Please don't go for this product, it is my personal view."
1,"Although HP has a big brand name but it‚Äôs product quality as well as customer service is pathetic. From the very first day, the paper was getting jammed inside the printer, for which I first tried to contact their whatsapp customer support, which was completely useless. First a chatbot will ask all the details and will hand over to some representative, then he will ask you all details over again. Then after wasting 15-20 minutes like that, he will just give you address of some service centre and tell you to take your machine their for repair. You will keep wondering if that‚Äôs a solution! Service centre will not pick your call. Customer care number will put you an infinite time killing loop, after waiting for half an hour, you ultimately will disconnect, and just curse yourself for buying that product!"
1,You will waste lots of time in doing setup. Every time you try taking print some or other problems comes. It does not recognise print commands. It‚Äôs nightmare taking print on this . Please go for some other brand. HP does not even send a person for installation. You will keep on wondering what happened why it‚Äôs not printing.
1,"Worst product, got used product. When i check the warranty status its showing start date of 12 Sept 2021 but i got this product delivered to me on 5 October 21"
2,Video Player is loading.
1,Ek dum ghatia printer hai. Photo paper se agar color print nikaloge ta print khrap ata hai. Or 6 dine ke baad hi paper roller ka issue aya .instaltion ke liye b koi nehi aya sirf phone be bata diye . Guys this printer is waste of money.
4,"Very good quality prints & copier, truely more number of copies compared to normal inkjet printers. For document scanning more options for sharpness or dpi would have helped. Installation & setup was a bit time consuming. Worth purchasing this printer in Smart Tank category."
1,"There is a issue with black printhead, cant take any prints. After raised complaint there is no response from HP service. Fake information of 6 hrs installation and service in amazon site. My money wasted."
5,Everything was perfect except packaging...I received opened packet/box of printer though nothing was missing so didn't made any complaint.
5,This was a replacement. Previously an used and dameged one was delivered.Very easy to install and set up..hardly took 8/10 mins to set up. Wireless set up was very easy.
5,nice quality
4,I'm using this printer for more than a month now. Hp sent their service engineer to install the printer. I use this wirelessly with my Android phone and Ubuntu laptop. I'm satisfied with this purchase so far.
3,"Overall the printer is worth buying as it is very very economical, moreover wire free/ wireless printing is an added advantage.Cons: the black ink when printer on photo paper/ glossy paper tends to smudge even after several hours/ days. Doesn‚Äôt seem to dry."
1,Not connecting to wifi
1,"Promised installation within 6 hrs , 24 hrs gone no one contacted even after logged the complain 2 times ."
4,Only one issue i found using this for one week. If we connect directly with our mobile Wi-Fi the printout gets struck in between.. This happens when printout is taken more than 7 pages. I cannot take 10 pages continuously.. other than that this a very good product for home.
1,"Very difficult to install WiFiStruggling , there is hardly anything in the manual"
5,Used for 2 weeks .. took photos and document prints
4,"Over all good quality product, elegant, easy to use, dilent, smooth"
4,"Printing quality is good, easy installation, no need to download hp smart app. Just use WiFi direct to print documents/photos from your phone."
5,Easy seamless printing from anywhere! Worth!
1,"I bought this printer on August 9 and useed from 15th August, but now its power switch is damaged. There is no response from customercare and other service number given in printer. The price of the product is also high."

5,"REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE: Oh this printer is stupendous!!! It deserves an 8 star!!!I printed a photo last week (on Epson gloss paper) and it came 100% studio quality. Well, thats enough for me! I can now make posters at home, without spending extra bucks in a studio. Love it. buy it!!----------------------Let me first say, that the 5-star rating I have given is not because L130 is the best feature-packed printer in the market, but rather it was the ‚Äúexact‚Äù printer I wanted per my technical requirement, specification, and budget---after a 2 month research.I am going to give a very detailed review, with some myth-busters. Yes, I see a lot of wrong Q&As and reviews that I would like to bust with my honest review on day-3 of my purchase.Home use, not for bulk or fast printing‚ÄìThis printer is a pure home or small business/shop use. Do not expect paper capacity beyond 40-50 (75 GSM) in the input tray. Print speed is fast enough for home and shop use. If you are looking for more paper capacity, super-fast printing, regular photo paper printing, well then invest in a more feature-packed costlier printer. For a home, student, shop purpose L130 is stupendous! I am yet to try on a photo paper, but that is ‚Äúextra‚Äù start if I get a decent print. If not, I‚Äôm happy the way it is.Single-function is what you need today‚ÄìEveryone has a decent smartphone that can scan and PDF documents using the camera. Free apps like Adobe Scan, Google Scan, CamScan, etc. can scan documents, align them, auto-correct colors, and will save you an extra 3-4K by buying a single-function (print only) printer. I see many reviews saying L130 is bad because it doesn‚Äôt scan! As it says, its a single function printer; it cannot scan.It‚Äôs an ink tank‚ÄìIf you do not want to fall prey for the ink cartridge scam, you need to go for an ink tan printer. Yes, ink tanks (like the L130) are a little expensive than inkjets cartridge printers, but in the long run, ink tank gets you the best return on investment (ROI). Inkjets are available for 2k and does max of 50-60 color prints. Making you buy another cartridge for 1.5k every 60 color prints. L130 can yield you 5000+ color (and 4000+ monochrome) prints in just one refill. The printer comes with 4 sets of colors, and technically you do not have to worry for a few months/years without an ink change.Compact for the desk‚ÄìIn its compact state (when trays are inside), the depth as less than 30 cms., making it ideal for any normal shelf/cabinet. Input trays also fits a 1 ft tall shelf. As needed, retract the trays to place the papers. See photos as it is easier to understand that way ;). By far, this is the most compact ink tank printer I‚Äôve seen.Loves Apple as much as Windows‚ÄìThis printer works smoothly (including installation in under 3 minutes) in Windows 10 and macOS 10.14 (yes, Mojave too!). Many reviews and Q&As indicating L130 doesn‚Äôt support a Mac. Well, sorry wrong informers‚Ä¶ it does support a Mac and all you need is to go to Epson‚Äôs website to get the right driver.Make it wireless if you have the right router‚ÄìL130 is a non-Wi-Fi/non-wireless USB printer. A few years back, when I upgraded my W-Fi router to a dual band AC model, I went for a router with a USB port and with an inbuilt print server, though I never used that functionality till date. That decision came to use now! Yes, if you have a router with print server (and USB port), you can connect L130 to the router and use it wireless! One additional step beyond Epson‚Äôs driver setup is that you will need to install the router‚Äôs print utility/driver. Simple application you have to download from the router‚Äôs website and you have a USB printer that you can print directly from a PC/Mac connected to the WLAN.Take it to the cloud‚ÄìOkay, now that you have realized that this is a print-only, home use, Mac friendly, and wireless ‚Äúcapable‚Äù printer, do you want to take it to the cloud? Meaning do you want to print from anywhere in the world? Well, folks, it is possible with some extra steps. As mentioned in my above bullet, if you have a router that has a print server and a USB port, make it connect to your WLAN. Once connected, register the printer to your Google Chrome account. Once registered, share the printer with any other Gmail accounts so that they too can print. For example, in my case, I registered my L130 in my Google account account using Chrome, and shared it with my family members‚Äô Gmail ID. Now all of them can print from their Android, iOS, Amazon Fire, PC, Mac, from anywhere on the planet---as long as their devices and the printer at home is connected to the Internet.Well, that me after the third day of use, but 2 months or research. Good luck Amazonians!"
5,"Have been using this for almost 1 year now. Compared to my previous HP printer, this has been running well. Printing speed is normal. The print quality is good for home printing purposes. The ink has been lasting more time that it used to in the HP cartridge printer. Simple to setup and use. The only draw back I felt is, the only mechanism to check ink level is to raise the tank and see."
3,"The printing is good, but only those who use often only go for it. If there is time gap, most of the time we had to clean the head or nozzle lest the print was coming in pale yellow., Which uses some % of ink."
5,"My experience started on a Wednesday before Diwali on 23-Oct-2019 when my 2-year old Canon G1000 Ink tank printer just stopped printing and just spooled empty pages. Luckily I had purched OnsiteGo Extra Warranty. They responded asap and sent an engineer who couldnt fix it and decided to take it to their service center. Subsquent follow-ups confirmed that the printer couldnt be fixed and OnSiteGo refunded the entire invoice amount of Rs 7098 as Amazon gift vouchers by 30-Oct-2019. Not bad for a Rs 450 extended warranty.I wanted to go for a simple inktank printer and while i wanted to go wireless, there are no printers with just wireless. You have to buy it as a Multifunction which to me is fairly useless as I do a significant amount of scanning using Turboscan including legal documents, bills etc, and so waste of money. I did read a bit of literature on how to enable a non-wireless printer on a wifi network if the router had a usb port and voila my router (supplied by Airtel) which was a Huawei Hg4185 had one. So before i decided, i did a test with a neighbour's old epson Tx121 printer and it seemed to work. Secondly the cost of a good wireless inktank multi was almost twice the cost of a basic ink tank print only device. My choices narroed down to Canon G1010, Epson L130 and HP115,. all of which were single function, ink tank printers with no wireless and no duplex (which are the main add-on features as far as i was concerned).As i had previouly used Canon and HP in the past, looking at the reviews especially by one the gentlemen on Amazon who confirmed the wirless part, I decided to go ahead with the Epson L130. I ordered the same on Amazon on 30-Oct-2019 @ 17:00. The printer arrived prompty at 31-Oct-2019 @ 10:30. I called up Epson customer care @ 11:00 to log an installation request. I got a call from their installation at 12:00 and he landed at home by about 13:00 and by 14:00, we were all set. The printer defiitely looks sleek and doesnt need a lot of space. The only eye-sore is that the ink tanks are outside the core printer and is a little bit of nuisance but no ways a deal breaker.My wifi gig however did not work. After a lit bit of hair scratching, I disconnected the printer from the wifi router, shut down the router, connected back the printer and restarted the router. And bingo, the printer was available on the wifi network.  You just need to make sure that the Epson L130 driver (either through the CD or online from the epson site) is installed on your computer. I think did the same on my dad's laptop and worked like a charm.The next step was to set it up for printing from a mobile device. We are thankfully an android household and once i followed the instructions on the google support site on Google cloud print, I was able to print from my android phone. Further you can also grant permission to others through email and as long as your printer is on and your wifi network is connected to the internet, you can print from anywhere in the world through your mobile. Quite cool indeed.SO overall, this is like any other inktank printer1/ Uses inktank technology (naturally) and prints decent prints at a cheap rate2/ Is slow (especially on color prints)3/ Doesnt make too much noise4/ Has just 2 buttons one for power and the other for indicating if there is an isssue (nothing comp;licated)5/ You will have to print at least a couple of prints a week to make sure that the nozzles are fine and that the ink doesnt go dry6/ I am expecting to see with lines in a few months (courtesy my canon G1000 experience) which will require a bit of nozzle cleaning.7/ very compact for a home office (more compact and ligher than my earlier Canon G1000)8/ Overall a good buy for home usage and which will hopefully last for the next 4-5 years with decent mainteance.So for a first day experience, am very happy. And lasly i did get the OnsiteGo extended warranty for 2 years. Hopefully their customer service continues at the same level as today.I will post a detailed update in a few months after testing it extensively. For now, totally blown away with both Amazon and Epson customer service and of course the printer"
1,"I have used Epson Printer for last 8 year.The Only problem is after Warranty period only the printer get not working problem.I have used: L210 model, L110 Model, M205(2 Printer) and Finally L130 Model.Problem is:1.Connectivity Problem USB Won't detect.2.Head Problem Replacement cost is too High.3.Switch ON and OFF problem.4.Motor Problem in Scanner.5.After (15,000 Copy even b/w or color) or Warranty period Expired new few month the printer will make any issue.6.We Can Not use this printer more than 2 year. Completely Use and Throw Product."
1,Worst service experience face ever in my life. This printer got dead in 1 week and service centre doesn't cover under warranty. They demand 6000 Rs for repair. Customer service in pathetic. Call centre disconnect the call without listen whole condition. Also I have check their official Facebook page.over there review section is hidden. No body can review about their services only because of worst service. After sell service is pathetic3rd class service.
5,"This review is after 3 months of usage.First of all for a printer to function well, you must print every 2-3 day. Even 1 page is enough.I've had no problem with this printer. I regularly print pages every couple days. Till now I've printer around 1000 pages (a bundle of a4 sheets printed both sides) and you can see the level of ink used. Its gives very cost efficient printing. Though the investment is a bit high for once. But if you have to print regularly it's the best deal. Its very light in weight too.Never go for the cartridge printer. Its the biggest scam in printer industry. Have already regretted.This ink tank is the best as these days there's no need for scanner. You can easily use apps like camscanner for the job. It will save your ‚Çπ3000 of the all in 1 model.I've attached pics of the printer, it's ink level after 3 months of use(1000 page approx) and a few print samples."
5,Awesome printer.I am not sure how many papers it will be print as I bought this printer one week ago.1.fast and good quality print2.sleek design3.easy installation on windows 10.(online installation done).also can be done by cd (attach with printer)
4,"i was having previously inkjet color printer costed me around ~2500Rs with small cartridges, due to printing volume key contributors been Kids, i got fed up on on buying small expensive units! so decided to shift to Epson L130  Ink Tank Colour Printer, reason being its Ink TANK! supporting hing volume of printing and ""NO NEED OF PHOTOCOPYING AND SCANNER""  till now my experience is great, its just ""FIT AND FORGET!"" easy to install and printing quality is very good, it took 1hr in overall to unpack,install and start printing for my 11yr kid ..you can imagine its ease..  finally AMAZON's in-time delivery and packing is awesome !"
4,"Build quality is goodFinish is goodEasy to installFast printingNot sure if it will print 4500 pages but shd be around 2500 as per quality of print selection.Color are goodNot many buttons, only 2 buttons easy.Less watt so save powerScan and copy not thereNo need of WiFi, just buy an OTG cable, download print share on mobile and connect to mobile directly for print.Prinshare premium will cost 199 per year which bus worth than spending 3k on WiFi printer.Price 6700/ my purchasing.Date 30may 2020.Go for it verdict!!!"
2,After 2 months of use problem started..while printing some lines at the mid lower part are being skipped and not getting printed...
1,"Usually our process with Amazon is smooth. However, on this occasion two problems: (1) Package wasn't handled properly which resulted in a hole on the side of the box and eventually we got to know from the service engineer that the mishandling resulted in the movement of a particular spring that was crucial to smooth operation of the printer, (2) We have already lost 4 months of warranty because as per Epson website the warranty commenced 4 months back. Overall, the entire experience feels like buying a used printer instead of a new printer."
3,Print speed is not up to the mark as they claimed.Standard print quality (normal): 7 pages per minute.Draft print quality (very low quality print): 18 pages per minute.BUT not 27 pages per minute.
5,Awesome.Good qulality with less money.Enjoying it.I already have HP 2541 all in one printer.but I lost money eqaul to 1 printer in buying Cartize.Now I free from these all complication.Thanks Epson .Thanks Amazon.
1,"The worst service ever. I ordered it and when it came the paper couldn't feed as the roller was not working. When I contacted Epson, they said they will get back in 3 days, I waited for 5, nothing came back from them. I ordered a replacement but this time I recieved a product with no USB cable, switch cable or ink. Epson calls itself consumer friendly but is a absolutuly garbage company. I had a bad experience with this printer, it's better to give a little extra cash and take an HP inkjet printer instead of this ""Kooda""."
4,"I used pigment ink instead of dye ink in it, which doesn't print well on normal paper but great in glossy paper. Printing is slow and noisy, but I am patient. I brought it to print poster and stickers and photos. I am happy with it at beginners level since I couldn't afford more to invest."
4,"Build QualityThe entire body is made out of cheap plastic, which looks very cheap. In image, it looks good but in reality, the built quality is the weakest point of this printer. I was very disappointed with the built quality of this printer.Printing qualityThere are multiple modes given in this printer, for best result you have to set the print quality to high in printer properties. This printer is not a photo printer but this can print passport size photographs without any issue but in larger color prints it creates some lines, impression of printing head, which is only visible at a particular angel. The printed document looks nice.FunctionalityI have faced only one issue that this printer does not load the ink into the cartridges (tank placed on the printing head) from tank and there is an initialization step which is missing in the user manual. You have to press the page indicator button given besides the power button so that it loads the ink.But when printer and up using all the ink, it stops loading ink in the cartridges which was really annoying. I had to open it up and fixed it. For cleaning nozzle and printing head there is an option give in the printer icon displayed in the system tray, you just need to right click on it in case printing quality degrades.ConclusionINR 7,500 seems a lot, if you consider the build quality of this printer. But duty cycle of this printer is high, Epson claims this can print 4000 prints in a month, I never tested the claim but if requirement is to take roughly 50 to 70 pages on daily basis including color Prints then this could work and if you can fixed small issues by yourself like ink not coming into  cartridges then overall productivity will going to increase."
5,"Ordering :- As usual amazon easePrice:- Very competitiveReceiving:- Smooth, as promisedInstalling:- Simple and compatible to win10Ink topping:- very easy. It took nearly 15-20 mins to charge the ink.Quality/Service:- very good, even on photo paper. Speed suitable for home/small office. Ink is available in cheap rates. I even topped up further.I became frustrated and started to feel cheated by the ink cartridge prices of other make. For normal home use, this is being impossible to buy cartridges. Now the time came to throw them out of one's life and move to ink tank system.Conclusion:- VALUE FOR MONEY. GOOD QUALITY PRINTING. SIZE IS SUITABLE TO KEEP ON READING TABLE.IF THE PRINT HEAD SERVE WELL, I EXPECT ATLEAST 5 YEARS SERVICE."
1,Not worth buying for this price when there are various other options available.Their return policy is terrible which force you to carry this burden rest of your life.
1,"Prone to a lots of problems. Often gives bands or other kind of problems even if the settings are all right. A small error here and there can totally spoil the print - the printer has zero intelligence, it has to be told everything and even then sometimes it malfunctions.PS: as you can see in the photo I have been able to make notepads with papers this printer has wasted."
4,"one must install Epson software to utilize all the printing modesB/W Print- Good. Draft mode is very fast and decent quality. High quality prints takes bit of time and way better than Draft(draft use very less Ink and prints are actually bit gray in color instead of BlackColor:- Good Prints. Have done some prints on glossy paper and it is like 90% match to what we get in studios. Good for home and small office use.Printshare app can be used for direct mobile printing via USB. (select generic driver)or just connect it to Router (having print server)serious doubt on the claimed print output. for general usage i think it will last 1/3 or 1/4th of the claimed numbers.( Attached screenshot of ink level after printing 450 B/W pages and 40 colour prints (20 prints was on glossy A4 paper ..high quality for photos).Nozzle clean. I have been using the printer almost daily for few prints, still nozzle clean is required. With less usage surely nozzle will get jam"
4,"The printer has a small footprint. Easy to install though the initial ink charging takes time. Print quality is good. The printer resets itself should there be a power failure and the cycling of the ink charging whilst doing this can be irritating. The printer is very noisy, especially when pulling a sheet from the tray - certainly not for use in bedrooms or where children may be resting. Need to check whether the printer restarts without hiccups after a long (month/s) break with the power off, or will the ink in the system clog and prevent normal functioning. More on this after I return from a 3 month break."
5,"Amazing Product Using from the last 1 Year, Buy with hassle freeOne of the greatest product in my list.I found all Pros only, No Cons to say,but improvement purpose only - ink tank if visible @ front are, it will be more good.Thanks and RegardsAshok Devulapally"
5,Bst Product...Bst Printing Setup...Buy it
3,"This printer has performed well although had a couple of instances were I had to spend some time troubleshooting. First was when I noticed very small amount of ink streaking the bottom edge of some print outs. Since it was inside warranty period called support and someone came in to check. Suggested I use a better quality paper , like 80GSM or more . Although it did not completely get resolved it is noticed only rarely.Second instance was due to print head getting clogged probably due to not being in use for a long period . Had to carry out some service myself using the print application and it is working fine till date. The service engineer did recommend using the printer at least once a week though. So much for ink tank printer to reduce printing costs.All in all pretty satisfied and would recommend it to anyone looking for a home printer if you have school going kids, occasional high volume printouts and/or regular low volume printing."
1,Brand new Epson L130 printer but keeps showing paper not loading (orange light) error. Didnt even print a single paper. Completely dissatisfied.Cant lift the whole unit because all sides have moveable trays or ink attachement. Very shaky unit.Epson Service Center in Bangalore didnt co-operate to check and rectify the paper loading issue hence had to return the product.
2,"The product is of very poor quality as already brought to your notice through customer service.It was pointed out to you that as my interaction with Epson company,one should not buy their products through Amazon as the quality of such products is compromised by Amazon.For ggenuine and good quality one should buy only from Epson.This has been proved right as the printer supplied by you is of very poor quality.It keeps on going out of order and the wuayof prints is really very poor."
5,"No doubt its a brilliant printer. Purchased for my home use. Its very easy to install which i did my self as all instruction available and provided with the printer just follow. I doesn't require scanner as every smart phone has a scanner and u can print with your smart phone using OTG and Nokoprint App (free) effortlessly. As print occasionally its okay to connect with USB cable instead of WiFi for which i have to pay 3500/- extra. Earlier i had HP 2600 all in one printer but cartridge cost will kill u, the printer gone faulty so instead of repairing that i purchased Epson L130. I am very happy with my decision and can print as many as i want without worrying about print cost.I don't know u this is not available to purchase as i had to wait for a month before it was back in stock not only on Amazon but any of the Online sites in including Epson online store."
4,"I have received the product today and below are my early impressions-Highlights-1. Reasonable price for an printer if you don‚Äôt want to get into cartridge business2. General print quality is good like, kids assignment, tickets printing3. Easy to setup and reasonable support from EPSON4. Ink bottles is cheap and black and white printing is goodLowlights-1. Warranty needs to be updated in Epson website as my warranty was reduced by couple of months2. photo printing is worst, tried both matte and glossy, not at all up to mark3. no option for b2b printingOverall it‚Äôs a good product for day to day chores, however requires maintenance against dust etc which is applicable to other printers also."
5,"Very good, print quality are good too, (though this my first day of usage) . Will be reviewing in future more about the printer after necessary user trial."
5,"During this lockdown, I wanted to engage my kids with their activities and wanted to have a mid-range printer function only device and after a lot of research and the amazon reviews I have made my mind to settle with this Epson printer and I would say this is a good decision.Pros:1. Compact Printer.2. Delivered fast from Amazon.3. Printing quality is good. Both image and texts are coming perfectly.Cons:1. Installation from the Epson takes their sweet time and needs a constant follow-up.2. The technician who came to install didn't have an idea about how to install the device. ( so I installed myself, by downloading the driver and watching YT videos. He simply was standing)So overall product is good and Epson may WANT to improve the customer service."
1,Not a good printer. I bought in 6999 R's.  After 15 to 20 colour prints the quality went down. Need to clean head again and again.  There are  ink lines  on the print. Print quality so poor. I returned it and very thankful to Amazon customer care for providing refund of the product.  Love the way Amazon takes care of the customers.
5,"I love this printer.  Print quality of Good.  Not as good as a laser printer but good enough for all practical purposes.  I have used normal A4 paper so prints on photo paper should be excellent.  It is easy to install.  Having used inkjet printers in the past, I am happy with this machine."
5,Very very good. Print quality are decent & speed is also adequate for home or small office. Economy of print is also great as every print take insignificant amount of ink ank ink bottle are cheap and also individual ink bottle are sold separately.No issue on paper I have never faced problem of jamed paper.I certainly recommend for my friends & colleague!
4,You need to put in the the whole ink of the bottle and have to wait for 20 minute or so before a print.Driver:  Setup with direct USB was pretty easy. I didn't have a CD drive in my laptop so dowloaded the driver from web.Making it wireless: Making it wireless was a bit of challenge. I use my wifi router USB port and made it a print server and added it on my laptop with http:192.168.1.1:631/printers/printername as identified in wifi router .Mobile phone print:I am using google print to print from my mobile phone but for that the laptop needs to remain connected to the printer and the google print needs to be kept open on the laptop. I have shared the printer to everyone Google account in family. So all of them can print.Print quality: not bad at allPrinting issue: if I have a lot of page and trying to print over wifi. I am facing problem. As the print is not reaching orinter. It could be because of laptop and the doc reader I have on it. As if I do print it over the google print from same laptop works fine.Maintenance: I keep my printer powered  all the time as lots of website says. It goes power off on it's on if not used for long time.Noise: little noisy but acceptable and as it's near router it does not disturb anyone.Wish I had: I wish I could directly print fro  my mobile over wifi without using google print as it requires laptop connectivity at the same time.I wish I could print from internet without any laptop.
5,"First of all purchased this at 7499. And today it's 6999. That's bad. This printer is compatible with macbook os siera, x. Its working like charm. Drivers are available on Epson web. After installing drivers just give any documents print order it works."
5,Plug and start using with minor software install. Super easy to use. Prints faster than conventional inkjets.The printer has different settings for different types of paper qualities. So if you're going to print a photo on a plain paper the quality is not at it's full potential.Overall happy with the product.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,"Printer collapsed in ,even after the call logged nd repaired by the engineer,it still not working.What a useless products.What useless products Amazon is providing.Need to return it nd want refund."
4,"Good packaging and delivery. Fairly straight forward installation guide. Print quality in colour is good enough for school work but not great like photo printers. Black and white prints are very crisp and clear.Does make little noise while starting and printing, so if you have a light sleeper baby, keep printer in different room or print while baby is not sleepingüòîWe do print 5-10 pages a week. Have to see how long this goes without running out of ink or any technical issues."
5,Product ok but we need stand also for labels roll. Without stand we are facing lil problem of jam inside it.
5,Good
1,"PLS DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM CANON.  THIS PRINTER DOESN'T PRINT MORE THAN 100 PAGES.  ALSO,  THE CUSTOMER CARE IS USELESS,  THEY WON'T TELL YOU EVEN A SMALL SETTING OF PRINTER IF YOUR PRODUCT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  3RD CLASS SERVICE BY CANON. REGRETTING MY DECISION TO BUY A PRODUCT FROM CANON"
1,Bad choice.  Stopped working after six months of fairly average use 2-3 prints a week. Didnt even last till first cartridge finished.
1,"The printer is defective, scan and xerox does not work after few days, its absolute waste of money. I felt never buy any more online."
1,"This product is worst, the first time the ink was completed too early called to customer care they said first it is a common behaviour (both Black and Color ink were completed for 60 prints). I have bought new Canon PG-47 Ink Cartridge it also completed within 100 papers printout. Not getting a profit from this printer because of Cartridge costs around Rs. 600 and each paper costs again .50 paisa. Finally, the user will end up with a loss.Worst experience with Canon printer."
1,Don't Buy . Don't Buy .Don't Buy . You will die purchasing cartridges which cost around rs.1400 . Print per page is 7 rupees per page black and higher for colour .
1,"The  product  did  not  respond  to  the  cartridges  installed ,  also  Wifi  Button  not  working  not  blinking  after  pressing,  Software  installed  on  PC  found  the  printer  unresponsive."
1,"Pathetic printer and pathetic service. Since past 6 months, the printer has broken down for more than 4 times. The service person takes about 2-4 days to return your request and last time around they did not even resolve the issue. Paper consumption is also very fast and cartridges very costly. Will not recommend at all."
2,"Printing is erratic.  Waiting time is too long.  Color printing takes much longer.Same case with printing specially pdf and excel files.Scanning takes long time.Color output is mediocre.Overall performance is poor, understable for the price. I wonder higher end other models may be better."
5,"a very nice product.absolutely no issues.superb printing thru usb,wi fi ,mobile.very sharp printing photo or text.no idea about cartridge printing capacity ( pages ).but overall love it.scanning is not tested yet.thanks amazon."
1,First time printer delivered was damaged. After replacement the printer delivered seems refurbished. It's wifi is not working. Key press not responding. I lose trust on seller. Even though i can return it till 17 Aug. App not allow me to return.
3,I am writing this review after using of two days. I am not satisfied with printer because there is no borderless option in this printer. Means it is leaving the white border of an incharound while printing . The photo size would be small. I asked the customer care officer about it. The second option is not available in this model. So I think it is better to ignore this model
4,Dont buy.  I am keeping it unused.  New oringnal ink I installed.  But printer does not recognise it.  Waste of money and ink (costing Rs. 700)
4,Good for home for students assignments n projects.Legal size prints are not available.Mobile to printer printing possibleHave to use with app n net routerSaves me frm taking late night trips for children's printing work

4,Print quality is ok. It is good value of money and very easy to install and operate by just going through mannul given along with this or on youtube
1,Printer started to have trouble from day one. Every time to get a single print you have to struggle with this junk for around one and half hours.. Their customer care is also like tinpots. Total waste of money...
1,After 3 month it stopped working..Warning orange lamp blinking again and againAfter it I called service centerThey told me they have not any solution of this problem..All my money gone in hell ....üôçüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
5,Canon is at the Top when it comes to printers. Reliability and durability are the hallmarks of Canon products.
3,Printer's performance is good. But catridges are too expensive and error 1401 (fine catridges are not installed) accurs frequently even with new fine catridges.
1,"Worst experience, only 20 to 25 pages print in one cartridge. Cost per page around 20 rs per page for black and 30 rs per page for color print.Don't ever buy canon printer without ink tank."
1,Very disappointed to see such service from Cannon. It's been more than 10 days to report issue of printer wifi not working and it's still not resolved yet.
1,"Return not available. quantity is poor / low catagory matarial use , drivers not esyly install , wifi not working properly, print costly."

5,Connecting to WiFi is tricky. Good printer
5,Nothing to dislike superb print in the wolrd
5,This is mainly for students who are under age and to do print many projects ..
1,Need to put papers one by one. There is no dedicated tray for papers. Very slow and low quality printing. Not good for printing certificates and documents.
1,"Dislike because of  catridge problem. Print quality, product are good. But catridge is not good. Though it covers one year warrenty no one pay any attention to it."
1,Very worst Amazon product.. I open the delivery pack printer not working...This printer has not even started!Amazon is unable to make it available to its customers by testing the products it offers to its customers.And finally.....This is how Amazon waste the time of its customers.
1,Very worst Amazon product.. I open the delivery pack printer not working... I send return request past 8 days... Problem not solved...

1,My printer not workingVery disappointed it was ordered in a much needed situations. But no response from your support
2,2 time stop working within first 5 month
3,"Got the printer yesterday in good condition. We printed 5 photos - Outdoor photos came up really well. Indoor photos where light is low, the colors do not show up as on mobile screen. Overall good buy.Two issues-1) Product description while buying mentioned Japan as Country of origin, but the description on product says made in China2) Instax share app is not good and has lot of bugs. One star less because of crappy app."
4,Amazing thing if you like to put snaps around house or present to friends! Output is lovely (you shouldn't expect a crisp lab like photo as it's not meant for that!!) Overall a very likeable print with fun element. Only thing is it's App which is stupidly made and it is good only as an interface to print between mobile phone and printer.  Go for it due to it's ah-ha value! And see a smile on your face or on the one who gets the photo!!
5,great device
1,"For such an expensive printer and such a famous brand, this turned out to be such a disappointment. It‚Äôs app has a 2.8 rating for a reason! Please don‚Äôt waste your money on this. I have tried connecting it from android and Apple phone plus I‚Äôve tried and followed all videos i could find on YouTube for help, I have this printer since 3 months it was a gift so I could not return it!! I feel so bad for wanting this wasteful product!"
2,"Not lab quality print. Battery is not available in Amazon. Epson e372cartridges costs 1799/- in Amazon, which is too much."
5,"Good studio like print quality, took first 50 standard quality printouts in 4x6 size photo paper with the supplied cartridge, still shows around 50% ink available in the cartridge. New cartridge is available for Rs. 1,099/- (Epson Shop). Happy with my purchase. :-)"
1,Worst product in whole amazon
4,The printer is good to print pictures. The print outs are of high quality and perfectly exposes the colour of the picture. Just that the colour cartridge ends pretty quickly I won't suggest this product. I bought this printer to print passport size photograph and 4*6 photos but I could print only around 200 pages before refilling it.The original cartridge cost is around 1200. So if I can print around 200 4*6 size photos by investing 1200+200(paper cost).Cost per page: rs. 7Selling price at our hometown: rs. 6I'm getting a loss.Recommended only for home use or for printing passport size photographs.
5,Very Good work
4,Its too costly and print quality not upto the mark. But it is the only option available so just go for it.
2,"Only 40 to 50 prints on A6 sheets, really disappointed..."
5,"After running for so many color printers in affordable price, i find this one best according to my needs. Really best photo quality on glossy paper with good shining. Most impressive thing is that it reproduces same color in photos as displayed in your monitor."
3,Ink cartridge price to much high and original not available . Amazon is my best friend .
5,price is very good

2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,"HP Neverstop Laser 1000a Printer purchase proved waste. I paid unnecessarily Rs.13499/- under false features shown on Amazon that it can print, scan and copy. But factually it can only print, In picture Toner Feeder shown whereas it is not given. For the false promise, I want to file the court case against Amazon and Appirio Pvt. Ltd Bangalore. Why this cheating in online business.  First, satisfy me by replacement of printer otherwise certainly I will put the case in the court of law and bring the matter to Finance Minister of India"
1,"1)Printer not give u print as by mention.....2)after 1200 normal word print, toner indication light is full, but print comes light, technician will visit, and of course you will get the toner replacement, but you have to visit service center by ourself with the toner, and replacement will get after 20 days....3) again i face the same issue after 700 to 800 print is done, then i have to repeat all the same process again....till then my warrenty is over, as sson as i get the toner , power board also get damaged (print comes full black).4) no spares wiil be available easily, because machine is newly lauch and i think not good...."
4,"Printer is good but pictures of the product is misleading, from picture it seems cartridge is also included but not this a case. Print single side only. Both side printing is time consuming and cumbersome."
5,"This printer is very easy to handle and operate. If you need printing very frequently and want it to be cost-effective, then this is the product you are looking for.Reviewing after using it for almost 20 days"
4,fast and cool look but have issues with manual duplex printing. often find broken page during manual print on both side.
5,i was little fear while buying this seeing all negative review i was using this machine for 4month still it is keep on printing the printing quality is super highly recommended for small scale business owners
5,"Awesome, value for money,i got it for 11000"
4,I use this product for general purpose i.e in home. This product is doing well
5,overall good
5,Amazon not given proper instructions.
4,Overall nice performance in terms of speed but a bit costly in terms of cost per print
2,"Not good, there is no wi fi connection  is established."
5,Nice product
4,Nice product
1,Waste
1,"If the printer works it prints well. But It starts giving problem within 15 days of installation.  One fine day  you switch it on a yellow indicator will light up near the toner loader and a triangle with  exclamation and the printer will show offline. THE TONER LEVEL INDICATOR IS FULL. It refuses to come online. In 15 days they gave me a replacement printer. The replacement printer developed the same problem in the next 15 days. When you receive a replacement printer they will never inform you that you need to get the warranty updated. They don't have proper procedures. You have to make calls to get Replacement Certificate. The response time with HP is so called 24 hours to 48 hours. in reality they MAY respond after 6 working days. That is 8x6=48. You have to shout your way out.  When you call HP service it will take them such a long time to respond to your call. You have to go through 2-6-2-2 The call-BUCK (yes, b-u-c-k) passes through a series of tables. In the mean time the line gets cut. you have to start all over again. They will never call you back.  If you want to avoid BP please keep off from HP."

5,Very good
5,Good

5,Nice products
5,Good one
5,Great
3,Good quality product
1,Poor
1,There is no USB port ! I am unable to install this printer. Need a refund!
3,"Epsons are the best printers they say. I find then a bit slower to respond. Also, there are submodels in the TM-T82 series which is not clarified here.The TM-T82 310 is a USB printer. Not mentioned. This is used for Receipt at the counter.The TM-T83 313 is a LAN printer. Not mentioned again! This is used in kitchen for KOT printing.I have to return one now. Not convenient.Epson are you listening? Educate your suppliers."
1,The printer even though says USB in its name but doesn‚Äôt come with USB port whatsoever. It is a network printer predominantly . The print quality is very good though unfortunately no USB support. Purchased from a local vendor but both the vendor and myself surprised to see this lapse. One star for wrongfully mentioning USB
5,"Writing this review 4 years after buying this printer. I must say this one of the very good printers which pays you for the money you invested. One ink bottle they gave along with the printer, lasted almost for 3.5 yrs (my printing quantity less though). Unlike InkJet printers, its ink doesn't dry if you don't use the printer for long (say for 2-3 months). You may have to do head cleaning once in a while.Overall, really a very good printer."
5,"Epson technology in printing is well known, but the economy if offers in running this printer is amazing, It is for sure the future of printing, and these printers will eradicate the Laser Printer in the near future. The most amazing thing is you are getting this printer at a discounted price at Amazon, that makes it even more economical for us to own one."
5,I ordered this printer for Xray printing and I am extremely satisfied with printer quality!
5,"Fast printer and good quality printing, glad to have bought this on independence sale!!!INSTRUCTIONS: To fill ink you need to push the ink tank towards the back as there is an indication on it to do so, then open a silicone cap inside to fill ink. First fill the initial ink then once you are done using that in months you can fill the bonus ink bottle if provided with package."
5,"We have so far bought 10 Epson 100 printers. On an averge, we take 100 prints of each printer per day. Never was there any problem in the last 3 yearsGood bye to the catridge printers !"
5,"Really a workhorse, I have two of them and both of them working butter smooth for last 5 months.Was bit skeptical about Epson but now happy on my decision."
5,The best part of printer is minimum maintaining and has single color most suitable for school and office work. Print speed is good. No ink issues so far.
5,Sturdy and reliable the way all Epson products are
5,Excellent
5,Really it is nice for common use.... reasonable price....the quality of the print also was good....We can install this printer very easily.... with out finding any difficulties...by reading the user manual....as per the instructions....üôÇüôÇ
4,printer is good. but its speed is very low after 50th number. so the printer want a rest after all 50 page printing. but i dont see any other printer like this speed. so it is better from others.
4,Product is worth
5,Super useful
4,"Really value for money, the printing speed is good."
3,good product for small office use.
5,"good printer with speed almost equal to laser printer. Good printer with network connectivity , to buy at this price"

4,Good product for money.
5,Economical and functional
5,Super Fast printing surely for rough use!
5,super saving printer. must have for fast and bulk printing
5,Good value for money
3,Ink consumption is high. Or else its good
5,Very good printer... Cheap to run. I would recommend it for office use instead of a laser printer.
1,For installation i had face lot of inconvenience. No engineer came to installation.
5,Good product
5,"Best monochrome, most economical, fastest in the segment, easy-care, Trouble-free office printer ever."
5,bill printing made easy
5,"Great Product,Value For Money,Run on Invert Also,Packing is Good,On Time Delivery"
5,"Most economical printer to use, available in the market currently."
4,"The printer itself is very good. It prints very fast and the print is of great quality. Also, the cost/page is quite good and my estimate is that it is the same as the 0.33 Rs / Page that Brother claims.Worst thing about this printer is that - it is not a network printer AT ALL! You cannot get it to work with Wifi, LAN. You have to do shitload of workarounds for this to print from mobile (Including downloading a proprietory Brother app) and even then it wouldn't print. You have to do a ton of setup to get this to be part of a network and even then it does not work. VERY VERY misleading tech-specs and from the looks  of it  brother spent 0 time working on user experience.Print: 5/5.Quality: 4/5.Setup and Tech: 0/5."
5,"The product is awesome, i print a book through pdf on duplex mode. Print quality is high, speed is awesome, pages come out of printer like gunshot, a lot of money can be saved through duplex mode. In default mode it gives us too dark print, so quantity of pages will decline, therefore i recommending all of the user to change toner darkness to zero from default setting. I will give you much more pages. I bought this printer at Rs.8,550 in sale."
5,Superb printer.If you want low operational expenses on printing then go for this. The cartridge is cheap and lasts long. No problem of ink drying if you don't use for a month. Heavy duty and can be used for offices also.Per page cost could be 30 paise printing and 30 paise page = 60 paiseSetting up is easy and even the wired one boots fast in 15 seconds and delivers one page print within 5 seconds.
1,never ever buy a brother printer bcz even for a small parts defects u have to buy whole components. And extremely costly for heavy or regular user since ink is non refillable and drum requires change every 8 to 10 months ...and drum roll and others parts unavailable in market.Only thing good is print quality but has to face lots of errors ....
2,"The printer is super fast and good BUT there is a catch. The drum unit is not available easily and is very costly around 2000 rupees. Also, no other company in the world manufactures brother HL B2000D drum unit."
1,damaged drum unit i got.
5,I bought this plain version for printing documents during lockdown at home.Very happy!Inexpensive and long lasting cartridge.I am glad to have switched to brother brand of printers after suffering HP laser printers for 22 years
4,"The printer is fast and seems to be of good quality.However, the printer delivered was manufactured almost 2Years back (see label) !I'd have preferred that this be disclosed in the product description."
5,Wow best and better product as till other competitive company's. Till one of the problem is cannot to Google drive print. And other printing. And duplex is single page not available.
5,"Bought it a few months ago, replaced a Ricoh I had bought a couple of years ago, had problems from the start with that and then on an ongoing basis.  This is simple to use, fast, completely reliable (hope I am not jinxing myself), ignores my idiocy (in placing things on top of the printer tray so the output has no where to go, super easy to clear jams), just a huge relief to use compared to the Ricoh.  The only thing I wish it had was a scanner. I realize that is not an option at this price point, but I would have preferred to pay more and get the scanner as well.  I think there is a place in the market for a simple B&W non-wifi printer like this with a scanner for a higher price (but not as high as one with all the bells and whistles, which are usually much higher.)"
3,"The printer came before time. The HL B2000D does what it claims, installation was a breeze. Its v fast in printing but seems a tad noisy for a new printer. Don't know how long the cartridge will last as others here say its not a full cartridge. Only thing that irritated me was the courier who delivered it was actually ROLLING the box on the ground. God knows how long he was doing that PLUS the box had an impact damage on the bottom coroner (could have happened anywhere) luckily there is a gap between the product & the box plus there was thick thermocol in between. They have a primitive system of registration of product. I got a shock to find my registration was rejected because the invoice was not included. The fact is I had attached the invoice (invoice number is asked for in the registration form) & the warranty slip which contains the product serial number. But apparently who ever looked at my ‚Äòregistration application‚Äô did not see all that. Reflects v poorly on the quality of ppl there."
4,"Solid no-nonsense product which does exactly what it claims. The duplex (double-sided) printing capability is extremely useful and a great way to save paper. Print quality is as expected from a monochrome laserjet printer. It also has a ""silent mode"" which slows down the print rate but significantly reduces the noise generated by the printer."
5,Pros:* Response time is less* Duplex print works fine* Print quality is excellentCons:* USB OTG is not supported. There is no way to print from mobile.
2,Within 3 months the printer has become faulty
4,Like the product. The only con I found till now is limitations of A4 pages.Without A4 no page size can be printed.Double side print is the main advantage.Good one.
4,Good for text only prints...Else Print Quality is average if there is slightest of graphic or logos. Best feature is auto duplex and that too at this price. One disappointment...  2 year old manufacturing date printer was delivered
2,"Printing presentation time is heavy and printing options are complicated, printing not directly come from documents, we need to go printer short cut for printing."
5,It is my first Brother printer. It is much faster than any HP or Samsung printer. The plastic and print quality very good. The design is excellent. I have to wait and see how many prints I will get in one toner refill.
5,Excellent printer with auto-duplex printing at a budget price.Pros- Excellent quality prints- Low cost toner- Auto duplexing- 250 sheet capacity Paper tray is fully covered and protected from dust- value for moneyCons- No wifi capabilities- A little bulkier in design than other competitors
5,The printer got installed as soon as it was connected to the computer.Print quality is 600 dpi by default but 300 dpi is also giving excellent printouts. It's a duplex printer which is very convenient and paper saving.
3,"If you are planning to print any papers of A4 size or less, it is okay. I tried printing legal size papers and end up folding the bottom of the papers to fit the tray."
5,Very good print quality of text; print quality of image lags behind when compared with other brands. But it's certainly good value for money. It's too early to write about other aspects as I'm using it just for a month.
4,Doesn't have capacity to add more than 1paper in additional paper tray
5,"We were sceptical about the print quality while buying, given the low price but it's been working great for the last 6 months."
5,This printer has a great print quality it has a very dark print as default but we can manage the darkness of the print and also the duplex print of this printer is very helpful
1,Not good quality and waste of money. Poor quality.
1,don't purchasebhai log warranty me h abhi to bhi koi suune ko ready nhi h koi or purchase kr lo
5,"This Brother Printer would be a perfect investment for almost all at home, regardless of its usage. It will always be handy to get print out 24/7, just go for it."
5,Best printer with duplex print.Cartridge can be easy refilled and manualy resetable.Value for money.
5,"Super print quality. If you are looking for laser printer and mostly print text and are low on budget, then without any hesitation go for this product.Using this for past 6 months and completely satisfied."
5,"It produces the best quality print and also this printer worth it for money in this range i think,when it's comes to the installation process very simple.. Totally it's match my expectations"
5,"Just delivered today, bought it for ‚Çπ9,999 at big billion days. And Bought 2 Toners too TN B021 at ‚Çπ701 each. So far everything is working smooth. I‚Äôll update after 3 months of use."
4,Nice decent productMeets expectations
4,It's a very fine printer except for the misrepresentation. The toner box ends in 300-400 pages and is not anywhere near to 2600 pages.
3,Print quality is not very satisfactory and in printer tray only one page can be kept for print
5,"Timely delivery, easy installation, good print quality"
5,Best value for money with good print quality and duplex printing.
5,"Superb print quality , Excellent Specifications at Low Price when compared to all other Brands ,  Low price of Toner Cartridge , higher print sheet quantity ."
3,Not bad
5,Fine
4,"The printer itself is very good. It prints very fast and the print is of great quality. Also, the cost/page is quite good and my estimate is that it is the same as the 0.33 Rs / Page that Brother claims.Worst thing about this printer is that - it is not a network printer AT ALL! You cannot get it to work with Wifi, LAN. You have to do shitload of workarounds for this to print from mobile (Including downloading a proprietory Brother app) and even then it wouldn't print. You have to do a ton of setup to get this to be part of a network and even then it does not work. VERY VERY misleading tech-specs and from the looks  of it  brother spent 0 time working on user experience.Print: 5/5.Quality: 4/5.Setup and Tech: 0/5."
5,"The product is awesome, i print a book through pdf on duplex mode. Print quality is high, speed is awesome, pages come out of printer like gunshot, a lot of money can be saved through duplex mode. In default mode it gives us too dark print, so quantity of pages will decline, therefore i recommending all of the user to change toner darkness to zero from default setting. I will give you much more pages. I bought this printer at Rs.8,550 in sale."
5,Superb printer.If you want low operational expenses on printing then go for this. The cartridge is cheap and lasts long. No problem of ink drying if you don't use for a month. Heavy duty and can be used for offices also.Per page cost could be 30 paise printing and 30 paise page = 60 paiseSetting up is easy and even the wired one boots fast in 15 seconds and delivers one page print within 5 seconds.
1,never ever buy a brother printer bcz even for a small parts defects u have to buy whole components. And extremely costly for heavy or regular user since ink is non refillable and drum requires change every 8 to 10 months ...and drum roll and others parts unavailable in market.Only thing good is print quality but has to face lots of errors ....
2,"The printer is super fast and good BUT there is a catch. The drum unit is not available easily and is very costly around 2000 rupees. Also, no other company in the world manufactures brother HL B2000D drum unit."
1,damaged drum unit i got.
5,I bought this plain version for printing documents during lockdown at home.Very happy!Inexpensive and long lasting cartridge.I am glad to have switched to brother brand of printers after suffering HP laser printers for 22 years
4,"The printer is fast and seems to be of good quality.However, the printer delivered was manufactured almost 2Years back (see label) !I'd have preferred that this be disclosed in the product description."
5,Wow best and better product as till other competitive company's. Till one of the problem is cannot to Google drive print. And other printing. And duplex is single page not available.
5,"Bought it a few months ago, replaced a Ricoh I had bought a couple of years ago, had problems from the start with that and then on an ongoing basis.  This is simple to use, fast, completely reliable (hope I am not jinxing myself), ignores my idiocy (in placing things on top of the printer tray so the output has no where to go, super easy to clear jams), just a huge relief to use compared to the Ricoh.  The only thing I wish it had was a scanner. I realize that is not an option at this price point, but I would have preferred to pay more and get the scanner as well.  I think there is a place in the market for a simple B&W non-wifi printer like this with a scanner for a higher price (but not as high as one with all the bells and whistles, which are usually much higher.)"

1,The cartridge of this printer ( hp laser MFP136nw) is not refillable.So after finishing the ink I had to buy a  new  cartridge of cost INR 3700.As as result the cost of printing a page is nearly 7 rupees which is extremely costly.Now I have stopped using this printer.Buying this printer is nothing but waste of money.Don't do the mistake of buying this horrible printer.Recommend to go for other brand.
4,"Its nyc printer, very light weighted, nice output, but Menu options are not soo easy, not sure how to setup wifi password. Need to press ""Ok"" button every time, if we gave multiple prints. Processing is not so fast.Overall, I gave 4 star, because all limitations are manageable, but output and weight and size is good."
5,"its really good product, only the auto duplex printing is not available"
1,Printer takes t00 much time to wake up and also it does not wake up automatically after the print command is given. Also it is a hell to install this printer. Very bad experience with the installation. Print quality is also not that great. Dark areas have lines even with the new original toner. On wi-fi it takes too much time to take the command and it takes a rest between two successive print commands which is super annoying if you gave it like 10 different files to print. Super Duper Annoying! They should stop making this printer. Not expected from HP.
4,"Both sides printing is not automatic, should be manually fed in the tray, the margin alignment while printing the 2nd page is not proper (which is really a drawback) otherwise it is a simple and good machine"
5,"Excellent printer, toner cartridge is costlier"
5,Best product. Easy to install. Great experience with print quality.
5,I was confused about buying this as this has just come into the market. But this is an excellent product. I highly recommend it.
5,Frst i received a printer which had a minor problem while printing den called customer care and they analyzed the issie and replaced me wth another printer which works fine..  Can buy product so far its very good..
4,Nice printer with a lot of options to connect and print documents. If printer size is a concern - then this is not the printer.

5,Outstanding print quality. Fast. Low price and running costs.Especially Amazons delivery and packaging is well
5,"It is really a great printer. Easy to install. You can use cd given along the printer, to install if your computer has cd/dvd drive. Otherwise, you can download drivers from Canon India website. First install drivers and then connect the printer to computer through usb cable. Printing is crisp and faster. It supports duplex printing. Hence it saves a lot of time while printing on both sides. Scanning and copying also fast. Overall, it is a really a good printer for home use and small offices!"
5,"Printer is nice. But there was some issues during transportation. We have registered for installation online. They came to get it ok, and told that issue happened during transportation. Still we paid for it. So while finding any issues please register a complaint instead of installation. Then they will not charge money."
4,Error of paper A4 LTR setting mismatch. Resolved myself through a setting that is not suggested in website. No immediate helpful support from canon. Giving high marks for overall build quality.

5,Starts immediately. Silent and smooth operation.
4,It is very useful. It is easy to print. I love it
1,For first time installation Canon ask me to pay charge. Very bad experience. Amazon didn't help me. I will file case against Amazon and cannon
1,The product is not working.Now I have a truly worthless printer.

1,Service are not well. And Xerox ar vary poor quality. Don't by this product

It is not recommended for use with 2"" wide paper as the adapter plate available with some other 80 mm printers is not supplied."
2,"Power cord missing, so couldn't use the product..Need to wait for new order."
1,Third class products don't buy

You can also search google review before buying this.The dual toner cost is 1400 and you can print 1200 copies.If i can get 4000 copies, that is adjustable.  I am thinking to go to consumer court regarding this."
5,Must for engineering  students who are fed up with collecting notes and printout for internalsIt may help you in a right waySo it is worth buying
1,HP calls it NEVER STOP PRINTER but its not true. Purchased in Sept 2021 from authorised dealer in Goa it has stopped working twice. First just after 7 days of purchase and now just before one month of use. First compalint was attended by service center after 6 days. Full drum unit was changed. now the printer .has stopped working completely. touchpad not working. service center is on holiday for navaratri. Didnt expect this from HP.

4,Best printer I have never seen value for moneyLow printing cost easy to operate the printerOutstanding performance by printer
5,"Sharp,crisp abd bold text"
5,Exceedingly awesome product
5,"All good but it is false claim that this printer and copier can take out legal page photo copy.That was the only reason I bought this product after days of research. Even through the ADF, and reduction to 91%, it does not give out full photo copy of legal documents.*ID copies come out very dark even after adjustments in brightness, contrast, quality.I feel decieved."
1,"Dear Sir & medam,Print Xerox copy not clarity in idcard photosPlease replace met my printer"
1,Only for a4 paper
1,"Auto Duplex printing process is very complicated, Paper Jam issues faced 4-5 times in 2 days times and replacement process very time consuming"
5,"Good and fast printing, easy to operate."
5,Not bad..!
5,Printer is good but this is noisy printer.
5,Good product
3,Product is working good I got some technical issue which is recently solved by engineer
5,Product is good
4,"its a multi purpose printer and speed is awesome more than any other printer, good clearity in printing i love it"
1,Poor quality Photo ID copy. Poor service.Speed is good. Charge Rs.750 / _ visit even then they do not visit timely.
1,Never buy a Brother printer. I have bought one and now I am suffering. Lots of problems because drum unit and toner units are separate. Not only that once warranty is over they charge Rs700 for every visit and Rs400 for a little small plastic attachment hardly worth Rs10-20.
4,"Printing & Copy Quality is out of Excellent, but the scaning has some issue. when we scan a Color page or photo the result is below average because the blue Colour is showing like fade"
4,"But for 22k On Amazon is too much, I Visited the Local HP store and i found the same printer for 18k with same warranty.Search for the cheaper option but this is the best printr with LAN and Wifi Functions"
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
3,Printer response is very slow. Printing is very light and the worst part you are not going to get your refill easiliy in local. Yes it is good for it's price and works good for domestic use only. I suggest not to buy for official heavy use.
1,"Don‚Äôt buy, it doesn‚Äôt have WiFi , misrepresentation of product as the images displayed are WiFi enabled. Even the seller is confirming in Q&A  that it‚Äôs WiFi.  Also doesn‚Äôt accept returns or replacement for this product. Try to suffer."

1,Mujhe smj nhi aaya
1,Poor quality
1,Most third class productAnd the supplier is not helpfulWhen you call them they need more time to help
5,"very good printer , and installation is too easy .very wonderful experience . i request everyone to have this printer for pos services"
5,"Good printer, easy to install and connect through wifi. Print quality is good.Remote printing using email is a great feature, app is good. Remote scan, mobile fax, and many other features which makes the deal even better.Only issue is that color ink has already started to show at half level only after 4-5 prints."
2,"Every time it takes too much time to get connected to wifi.....sometimes, the printer get confused...Technical support to solve the issue is poor...It's worth to buy directly from Shop because the price is same and guarantee"
5,Amazing product.
5,The machine has more RAM than comparable models. Hence it is able to print faster.The scan functionality is supported by a good software.It has a cover for the feed paper so that as to protect the paper in the tray against dust.The machine also turns on fast. I have used models from another popular brand and find hat this one performs much better.
5,I got this before 9 months i am using it form my small office business. Trust me this printer is perfect in every way. We take every day 3 to 4 copies. 8 to 10 prints and 3 to 4 scanning in a moths. very clears prints. i refilled 1 time
4,the printer is a bit heavyDoesn‚Äôt need much space to place the printerPrint quality relatively very goodFast printingEasy installationNeed to down the user software from canon websiteEasy onlyGot it a bang on deal for almost 10.7K
3,the profile on this page says that this printer is duplex (both side printing) but in reality I am unable to print both sided so could you either explain me right way or change the information already provided immediately
1,"It was a very bad experience faced with the Canon MF 3010 Printer. I could not able to print after my 64th Paper.Following are the issues I faced after that.1  Faded prints came for near 10 pages after that nothing is printed.2  After the advice, I tried to change the Toner Powder, No luck nothing is printing3  I have been asked to change the drum as well. But the service team is not confirming that even if I change the Drum.4  I have been asked to change the Catridge itself for the new printer.Asked Amazon Agent about the product and they are not ready to solve it."
1,I received it this way
5,I have the same model and using it for thirteen years without replacing any spares. Excellent printer from Canon. No paper pickup problems or paper jams. Please keep the printer protected from dust and other foreign small particles like used staple pins which if accidently get inside may cause paper jams. If paper gets stuck please follow instructions by the manufacturer to get it out the right way. Pulling the paper the wrong way may aggravate the problem. The paper pick up roller should be cleaned when necessary. Printers are electromechanical devices with sensors attached to perform the necessary functions. Dust and moisture are both enemies which may cause problems in the long run. So avoid them as much as possible. Careful occasional vacuuming and blowing will keep the printer in good condition. While changing the cartridge be careful. Do not do anything by force. The cartridge should gently glide in the rail without any obstruction. Recommend the seller as it was delivered on time and in perfectly packed and new condition. The price could be a little discounted.
3,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.
1,Damaged product
1,Its all you can aske for in a Monochrome Laserjet Printer. Simple to operate and good quality scan and print. Let us see how many copies the cartridge gives as it's shown as 'Starter'. Felt cheated in the deal though as the Output as r product description is shown as color. whereas it's a MONOCHROME printer. Didn't expect this from a Canon Dealer.
4,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."
3,Very difficult to install by searching different videos on YouTube. Still i couldn't do it. Not started using after trying a lot.
5,I have been using this printer for several years now and this is my second purchase. That should explain what I think about it.
4,Printer is good.. but is makes lot sound while printing.. .. 10 k is ok for this product.. for 12k it is waste
1,"No colour options, not suitable for my requirement, if I want to replace with other models which has colour options, Amazon says not possible. Waste of money."
5,"So far my experience product is good. Price is really low.It is useful for home & small office use. print quality excellent. Packaging is excellent , I expect more good products from Amazon.  transparent & hassle free service  .Also I will recommend for friends & relatives to buy product from Amazon"
5,"- Printer doesn't occupy much of space .- Prints Efficiently & prints are crisp & bold even in Toner Save Mode .- Start-up or warm-up time is less than 5 seconds .- Easy to setup like '' Plug & Play ''All features - Print , Copy & Scan work efficiently .However if Wireless Printing could be provided , it would be cherry on top .If you want to buy a affordable multi-function printer , this is a safe bet ."
3,Printing problem occurred after 6 month of very normal use... Print speed is fast but does not print properly.
5,Excellent for rapid mass monochrome printing.  Can stand considerable abuse and keeps working.
2,I purchased this printer and I recieved a defective product. The printer prints at a very light copies. Also I am not recieving the service for the same. #Pathetic Canon..
5,Hood
1,Installing problem
4,The printer is very good but if you are planning to make it wireless with your raspberry pi then you will run into issues. Canon ones aren't usually supported by CUPS printing service and its a night mare to try to setup.So take this if you are plannign to use a separate print server or as a standalone printer. Doesn't work with raspberry pi.
1,It seems that it doesn't support legal size
5,As expected the printer met with my requirement. Found user friendly and value for money.
5,Everything of the product is perfect but the courier takes too much time to deliver the product and the service support of canon at Bhopal is fabulous.
4,Nice
5,Good product
5,Good product
4,Only 100 pages print with and again refilled
1,Your deliveried printer is not working. Loss for money. This is very bad
5,Best in market in this price range
4,Print quality is very good but print quantity is not so much refill  it every 6 to 700 pages.
4,First class but wireless connection is not there
3,The printer we received within a span of one week itself we have to refill the cartridge and then its showing a drum problem that also we already replaced... The item is not meet our expectations....
5,Perfect home office printer; great deal from Amazon. Super performance; printed about 700 pages in one go and worked like a high end heavy duty document printers.
5,Good  Experience best quality print
1,It didnt work since the input of first pageThe very next page got jammedReally had a bad experience with it
5,"Printing , scanning quality all are top notch.The setup is easy build quality also is premium. Highly recommend."
4,Very good and useful.
1,Don't buy.. It is not an original product.. The plastic body is good but the cotton pads inside are not the company advised which is main thing about buying the ink pad. They have replaced with cotton which you find in a chemist shop. That is why Indian consumers do not get good quality products.. Cost-cutting has been done.. People dont want to sell good products.. just earn money by doing what they see fit.. ashamed!
2,"The sponge that came along was of terrible quality and also its very different from the one that came along the printer,"
1,Spinz Quality is not good

4,Nice
5,Good
4,"The printer is easy to configure and use. Has decent signal reception in the room I have kept this, away from the wifi router which is in another room. For comparison, my iphone does not receive signals from this area.I have been using this printer for more than 7 months and the experience has been really good. It gives your professional prints. It came with two bottles of ink and despite several prints, the first bottle is showing no signs of wearing out.The printer is compact and can easily be accommodated into a cupboard. Check the dimensions to decide where to place this conveniently in your home or office.Once the wifi is configured, it connects to the network in a few seconds every time it is turned on. The indicators are also well placed and gives accurate information on the network connectivity and paper loading.I have kept the printer idle for long periods of time and have not observed any sort of issues after this period of inactivity. No printer ink issues or any general issues.The biggest drawback of this printer is that it doesn't support Apple Airprint (although the seller listing says so). This will not allow you to print directly from your iPhone and iPad. For this purpose, I am using a Mac application by the name HandyPrint. Once you install that on your Mac and turn the Mac on, your iPhone and iPad will detect the printer if all of them are on the same wifi network. Then you can print it.Another issue I found is that the default software CD that came along with the printer did not work well in installing the driver. So I had to manually download the driver from the internet. Once that is done, your Mac will automatically detect further updates to the driver.I am rating the printer at 4 for its excellent design, hasslefree operation, and savings it offers. The only concern is about the lack of AirPrint support which would have easily tempted me to give it a 5."
3,I don't get a perfect installer... He didn't know how it will work with wifi..I dont give any satisfaction signature to hum..but till now no call i got from Epson.Improve service Quality..You can think i am in State capital..what happened who buy from a small town.
2,"Hi, i bought this printer for printing packing slips of ecom having barcodes.This printer is affordable, easy to use. But this intank technology is not good for printing barcodes. Please avoid buying intanks, go for laserjet only. Today just after 5 months, i am throwing this printer as even epson support is not able to sort this problem. and puschased laser printer."
5,Suitable for office n home .I have just bought 4 of them .Epson is gaining back its market in india.
1,THIS PRINTER DOES NOT PRINT THROUGH ANDROID MOBILES. WIFI CONNECTIVITY USELESS. DO NOT BUY IF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY IS MAIN REQUIREMENT.
1,Epson products are good. But supplied product from dealer is very old manufacturing date and have very little time to register for warranty claim. also poor packing and found not working with an hour.
4,"Good printerLost the driver CD, can't install the printer for our ultrasoind scan machine without cdTried installing from drivers downloaded from net but failedcan anyone help me by sending me the cd"
2,Not connects with the iprint application of epson.not a smooth way to connect with any device.it's a semi wireless experience only. no much difference between wireless and wired model.
1,"After a month of use, it developed a malfunction. Could not get help from Epson India.Buy at your own risk. Although my previous buy has been ok"
5,"It's a good product, but the technical support is pathtletic.. There is no WiFi direct in this model.. I got this model thinking it ha Wifi direct. I tried contacting tech support which no much help.. Since YouTube was there i was able to manage things out myself"
1,The free installation numbers given are out of order. The number printed on the box is switched off. Hopeless after service
3,This printer works very well but doesn't have mobile printing feature as listed on the website.
5,Perfact printer.But u can't connect via direct wifi...?U must have to connect via wireless router.
5,Excellent - worth the money
4,so far so good.
4,Printer is good workingWiFi networks is not showing in app problem
1,"The seller sending warranty completed products. On trying to register in official website, the warranty already completed to the extent of 8 months."
3,Prints a blank line in images and could not be resolved using tools provided with the driver.
5,"Print quality is very good, but connecting for wifi printing is a tedious job. It should be made simpler!"
1,Had to call Epsom for installation. The usb cord was so short had to buy a new one. Haven't even printed 100 pages and it started giving low ink sign.
5,Not connected towifi or server or router

5,Bought the printer. Easy set up on all laptops and can identify multiple Wi-fi's at home. Powerful wireless and prints instantaneously even when it is sleep mode. It is also fast and does duplexing well.Have not tried the ADF. No complaints and runs smoothly.
5,It's good one.Duplex printing is good.High speed.Size of printer can be reduced is the only drawback.
1,Brother customer care is not support properly and amazon is not supported properly
5,"The quality of the printer is very good. I have installed the printer myself as lockdown is going on. The brother serveice engineer will face difficulty to come home for demo. So better you try installing.The model is very good and I got it for a very good deal for 21,500. Unmatched performance and features for this price.Overall I am very satisfied with this product."

2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,The price of this printer is Rs.17668 on HP official site.Do not buy from AmazonHigher priceLow quality
1,The price of this printer is Rs.17668 on HP official site.Do not buy from AmazonHigher priceLow quality
5,Good printer.Easy to useEasy to connect WiFi.500 pages printed still ink remain same level.Light weight.
5,Super
5,Awesome print quality and photos also print very fine with clearity.Economically best for small and medium business.Installation is very easy just like plug and play.With wifi direct print not required internet.Direct print from ios and android phone with epson iprint app.
1,Printer stopped working in 10 days.The paper had jammed and apparently it broke a gear in the printer.Been over a month EPSON does not have a part and not willing to replace a brand new printer which had this issue.Really disappointed with the service & would not recommend to buy this product.Tech support has still no response.
5,"Multiple printing options, even kids are able to print school notes from mobile / laptop very easily. Epson iPrint mobile app is very good and convenient for printing from mobile. One of the good options is printing via WiFi Direct option of the printer - this can be used for printing from Epson iPrint app even when WiFi is not available."
4,The product was delivered as expected without delay. The printer was installed by Epson Service person. The print quality ok. Only concern is that when first printout was taken it was mentioned that first print out was taken before my billing date.
1,"This product is bad, so I want return fund or want other items"
5,"Best monochrome inktank printer. It only has print function, you can also print with via wifi. These days you dont need a scanner, mobile camera serves the purpose.With epson iprint app you can directly print from your phone or tablet"
1,"There were many issues. Seller provided used refurbished product which was having paper loading issues. We requested replacement of the initial printer and replacement printer came after 15 days and got rejected due to serial mismatch. Thanks to amazon prime, they have agreed to take the initial product back and provide the refund."
5,Epson is a estblished player in printer.  M1120 is a WiFi printer. Print quality is good.  For double side printing from mobile we can use doc scanner app.  Use good quality paper for best result.
5,Print quality is very good and cost per copy is very low. Nice one. Took near about 300 prints. No issues
1,"Faulty product recieved. Printer ink is not charging, not able to register on epson online, faulty product delivered."
5,Good productPrinting quality is very niceSome times it take time to connect .
1,"Worst printer I have ever seen,Paper gets stuck"
4,Shortage and hike of prices on epson 3156 made me switch to this product. Not much on user manual to connect thru wi-fi . So far good

5,Every thing perfect
5,Free installation was nice.Once installed easy to connect with WiFi.No modem router required.Can be used with epson iprint app.Easy and quick wifi connectivity with wifi direct. No laptop or pc required direct phone printout. Android and ios both can be used.Once installed read instructions for wifi direct setup.
5,Nice quality printer . Print quality better than laser printer .Printing pdf documents are fast but printing photos and scanned documents is a bit slow.Overall it's technology is better than laser printer .
5,"Epson the best and easy in installation. Print quality accurate ,since monochrome with ink tank. The use is for daily home/office ,being mutual fund and insurance business of myself. The WiFi direct works superb ,no internet needed. Also works with Wifi Router ,where one has to press wps button and pair the Epson printer. Direct print from your mobile and also from laptop/computer. Print from web ,cloud printing ,email. Always read the manual given carefully and then set the printer ,that would be the most easy installation."
5,Product is very good üëå but it cannot print barcode on bill print quality satisfied and look is fantastic superb product.
1,Don't buy this product I'm very disappointed of this product

5,having a wonderfull time with this product working fine ....
5,Superb quality and speed
1,The printer costs 3500 Rs and just 20 sheets of paper itself cost 3000 Rs...better to get it printed from a Photoshop instead of wasting money on this product. Earlier the paper was sold around 800 Rs and now suddenly the paper price is increased to 3000. Zero value for money
2,The printer was of a very convenient size to carry with you. But I returned this product because the print quality was not good at all. All pics looked blue washed and there were lines on the picture which made the print quality look really bad. It's not worth the price.
3,D problem wid my hp sprocket plus is tat it does't give me a perfect picture. d left side of d print mostly shows white vertical line..so unable 2 print d complete pic.
1,Product not at all received. :(
5,Amazing price and easy to use. Print quality slightly desirable.  I have the regular sprocket and Polaroid zip. So I knew the short coming of zink printers. Slightly more prominent on the plus but very useful if you travel as can take out passport pics and farewell selfies.I take it everywhere. The sprocket 2 costs 3 to 4 times the cost so value for money
1,Very poor quality of the prints. Quite disappointed with the product. Not worth it at all.
1,"""The process is process"" .. this is what I keep hearing from Amazon. It is current day support where customer value is zero. Very disappointing service.I had ordered the epocket printer as gift and wanted to return since it wasn't seen as useful. I've been feeling fooled. This is one item that no one purchases and since you have, we will not return until it's faulty.I've been a frequent online shopper and never seen situation where I can't return something if I don't like it."
1,Print quality not goodAnd availability of sheets not in IndiaNit worth buying the product
5,amazing qualityi got it for ‚Çπ3500worth the moneyamazinggggggbest quality if u have good quality photo in mobilei dont know why so many people have complaints üòï maybe its very pricy now thats whybut according to my money it was way too much worthy‚ù§as u can see in picturesome picture are printer from redmi 6 phots and some are s20 photos üì∑only slight diff in qualitythese pics are oldnow i had purchase more papers today bcz i loved it as u can see my intrest in photoüòÇits the best printer if u r searching worth for moneyhope it will help uits better to wait for an offer on this or for price dropthankyou
4,Likes :Very CompactEasy to Set upPerfect size film (or whatever one calls it)Now I'm gonna printDidn't like the fact that it was 12K awhile ago (I almost bought it then) ....it's 4K now üôèü•Ç.... The additional box of 20 film cost 3K plus ...HP manages to rip us off anyways üò¨üòõ
5,"Unable to  decide if I need to put my money on an INSTAX type camera or a HP Sprocket +, decided to go for this, based on my understanding that I have a mix of photographs from Smart phones and SLR, both of which have better resolution and image capture, and what I needed was a quick mechanism to print.  Its been around a month and I am very happy with the performance so far. The prints have 1 f-stop less light and slightly yellowish tone, but its a matter of quick edits in the sprocket app that does the fix."
5,"Such an easy to use, handy device!"
5,"I gifted this printer to my brother who recently was blessed with baby, knowing how much he likes to collect the memories around,thought this would be the most useful gift. Photo quality is not very rich, but does the work. The printer comes with stickable back papers which makes it easy to stick anywhere.It heats up easily but does not affect the performance which was good."
4,Print quality is okay for the price.. high resolution pictures print well.. photos come full sized and tell pack is cheaper.. but the Fuji film seems but realistic... this is also good and compact
4,Really useful for instant printing. Convenient to use and works perfectly well
5,"We bought it for my Sister In Law as she is an avid traveller and takes a lot of pictures. She really liked it. It is compact, easy to carry and easy to use. Planning to buy for my parents as well."
5,HP should supply more papers around india for this printer or should stop selling this printer in India... Also should supply a bigger bundle for papers so one can buy these at cheap rates
5,Excellent product from HP
5,Excellent
1,Photo quality is very bad.Photoe getting printed are very dark. The photo was taken in proper sunlight ye photos printed are dark. Now the product is just a waste kept in my cupboard. Can't keep it can't throw it
4,Paper cost more than standard version.Prints are little darker than the orignal
1,"After 3 printing, print quality decreased, now printed pics are blur, I can't return it, I am feeling cheated."
4,"received the product ,there is no instruction manual to start using the printer where do i find it help me"
5,Very good
1,Too much cost for printing paper. It is not available easily. It is not suitable for common man. It is highly expensive

1,I got an unsealed product.How can I trust tha whether it is a new piece or already used.
5,"We need a dot matrix printer for our society since we need to print bills. Recommended by our accountant to go in for a similar option, I finally opted for this one.The service technician was very helpfulEasy to useCartridge is not so expensive and is long lastingOffer on this seller was the best even when compared to market ratesSturdy and tough productWill  go a long way like the previous  one"
1,The worst product. Don‚Äôt buy at all. They sell duplicate defective product.Its not printing at all as it is.

4,gud
1,printer was damaged
1,Its not good to instalation . Firstly they provide CD to instalation  which is we cant use. Then when you find instalation on websites tehre are many drivers have you get confused then call to epson customer service  then they ask you for serial number  when tell them serial number. They told that your product warrenty has expired and you have to register to again and fill up all imformation after that you get one more message that Incomplete Registration. Then again you have to contact Epson Customer service then they will tell you to email that message screen shot after that you have to wait for 48 hours. If call them for it they will tell you all this.  Worst service of Epson. So guys dont buy this product online.
1,WE BOUGHT A NEW UNIT YESTERDAY AND ITS NOT WORKING. THEY HAVE SENT A USED CABLE AND THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK. ENDED UP BUYING FROM THE MARKET. I KNOW THE PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT THE SUPPLIER SEEM TO HAVE PLAYED THE TRICK. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE.
5,Print quality depends on paper. Machine works fine..
4,"Product is very good no issue but seller sold me different model than mentioned like USB+parallel ports model, i received only USB port based model not t82IIBut it's ok that USB port is ok to me"
4,It doesn't comes with Ethernet LAN Port. Please check your requirement before placing order.
4,"I liked the product but I haven't got the invoice along with the product. How will I claim the warranty in future if it comes across some fault? I need proper invoice, without which it has no meaning of warranty."
1,"Used Adapter was given. I was surprised once I received and opened the package. But somehow it worked until now. Today the adapter of the printer was leaking oil from it and it stopped working. What to do, where to go for complaint?"
5,It's a good printer. Very user friendly. Iam using for our shop.
5,"amazone deliver this product very fastly. i ordered this product and with in 24 hrs product was in my hand. it is working fine and the best part is, this product has a onsite warrenty.no need to go service centre for any problem technician came to ur home."
5,Excellent delivery by Amazon. Product is exactly the same as promised.Pretty good printer. Printing bill is juz like a cakewalk. Auto cutter feature is cool!. Thanks to Amazon.
1,"Not up to the mark, not having driver CD and not even printer support team helping us for this printer , I never recommend to buy this printer and we don‚Äôt have some part in the printer. One of my worst experiences till now"
1,"The printer I got is broken, and is not printing properly even the paper cutter of the printer is not working, I want the printer to be repkaced"
1,"Very disappointedDecember 2017 product is delivered, epson website is showing out of warranty on first day."
1,"recieved a faulty product .socke was loose ,as soon as i connect the print cabel the printer switch off ..maybe due to faulty wiring ."
1,Seller has given the printer whose warranty is already expired.Epson person came and said that this product warranty is already expired and we bought this just 20 days before.

3,Good product
1,Please avoid purchase from Amazon.I have purchased on 25/7/20.They sells an old item for me. Epson says the product exceeds 90days window period. So they only allowed warranty upto 30/1/21
4,"Although not for long I used this product.  Writing this after two days use. But, the feel of the printer is good. It's of a solid build up. The print quality and response on command is also good.The ink tank filling with ink in an automated and hassle free way with the provided ink bottles of the company. No worry about cartridges.  The ink level is apparent in the ink tank. After all its an excellent product."
3,red light error problam bahut jayda hai
4,I bought this printer recently and I found this printer is quite good. Print quality is good but not excellent. If you are using normal low cost printers like HP and other then replace it.  This printer is easy to use and quite fast in printing.I definitely recommend this printer. I am happy as of now.
2,"Good for black and white, but colour print is not qualiti."
3,Print is very slow. Copying is a headache. Ink Injectors/Nozzles jam frequently. Am not happy with the product. Service is very pathetic. Service Technicians take money and after 2 days same problem occurs again. Then they don't come or don't pickup phone.
5,Good
1,"It was very easy to install. I tried for 2 days to take a single print but not succeeded. Printer was throwing just blank papers out. I tried head cleaning, nozzles check and power cleaning too. But nothing worked.I am returning this product and waiting to be refunded."
4,NICE
1,Glass broken return
5,Nice product with good colour

4,"setting it up was a pain. took some experimenting and poking around. but once i figured out, it's working well so far (only a couple of days into it.)no software came with the item. had to download it from zebra website and that wasn't straightforward."
1,"the software is not working properly, very hard to use not suitable  , no software and service available from company and distributor"
1,Very difficult to printSupport also not have for help me
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,First day first showüëéüò°Very DisappointedAs you see colour where not properly set as pictureTotally worst
3,The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving.  One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.
4,"Nice product, all function available, futuristic product, wit wifi , scanning copy, multi function.Only cons is the set up via mobile app it is easy for setup watching youtune video.But for window installation it is difficult, as it is a new printer,hence driver properly not worked, u need to take guidance to HP customer support.Hp customer support was very helpful  guided me 2 hrs & get the installation completed.Ink consumption still not rated, as 1 week only i am using , quality & usability aft insatalltion is pretty good for home use.."
1,"1) Printing SPEED per page VERY SLOW,2) PRINTING COST OF PER PAGE VERY HIGH, TOTALLY BOGUS / MISLEADING INFORMATION CIRCULATING  BY HP THROUGH FABRICATED ADVERTISEMENT REG HP PRINTER 2723 JUST TO MISGUIDE CONSUMERS/ CUSTOMERS.  HP-805 CARTRIDGE COST TOO HIGH BUT PRINT OUTPUT VERY POOR ...ONLY 25-30 Pages. ALSO 805 CARTRIDGE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE EXCEPT AMAZON. PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS SAME AS PURCHASE OF ELEPHANT FOR PERSONAL USE !!!"
1,"Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive"
1,"I am sorry to say that the Amazon is not helping me to replace the product,  I know product is ok but it's not compatible to me and this can be fairly good to return it.Kindly help me for the same"
1,i hardly took 20 prints in of blackand 5 prints of colour .. and now low cartidge indication is happening..u people have given used cartidges.. how can cartidge finish in so less prints..better not to take this kind of printeri have done a mistake i think by taking this printer
1,"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.  It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly.  First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.  I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer."
1,"Printer worked fine for the first few weeks, then suddenly it stopped working and required me to setup the printer again - when setting up the printer it requires you to use ""SETUP"" cartridges that come with the package, when I had to redo the setup even though I've used the ""SETUP"" cartridges which had worked and printed documents - the printer now does not recognise them and refuses to print anything. Now it's just an expensive piece of plastic sitting on my desk, complete waste of money. Even reached out to HP support but no resolution."
1,The printer comes with a faulty cartridge which cannot be replaced through the service center. The service center people would try to avoid any issues regarding cartridges. HP customer support and chat support are useless. They would try to fool you if you contact them. The Chat executive had asked me to contact Amazon regarding the Cartridge issue on an HP printer. No service personnel assistance for setting up the printer as promised in the Amazon ad. Color print is not 100 pages as promised it is less than that. Every time the Cartridge depletes you need to substitute with a new cartridge costing Rs 747.
5,It is too automatized to troubleshoot. The HP support sucks.We do not have any troubleshooting help on the printer screen and the app errors are generic. Could get one page printed after wasting 3 days in troubleshooting. It again got stuck with another error the next day! Cannot return this anymore so stuck with this one
5,Amazing Printer Cheapest Price Wirless
1,"This Printer is very difficult to setup on a JioFiber router. Otherwise as well, my previous HP Wireless 3540 Series printer was much easier to setup on Wireless. This is just a crazy hassle, trying to connect through a SmartPhone. Please dont buy printers that have setup through a SmartPhone. It has crazy combination of buttons you have to press, to enable to Setup mode. The previous HP 3540 printer had clearly defined buttons that defined what was what."
3,It is not nearly as easy to install and use as it says. I have not been able to connect it to a JioFibre Wifi network.I use the in-built HP wifi network. I can‚Äôt print using my phone connected to the internet because my phone has to be connected to the HP wifi and not to JioFibre.I don‚Äôt know whether it is a restriction of JioFibre.
4,"1. you can print directly from any machine / mobile connected to same network2. you can also email an attachment to print from anywhere.3. it is not necessary to always change network to print.4. Mobile setup is easy, use HPeasystart setup from hp page to install in windows,  if you messed up anything, use HP print and scan doctoroverall a good buy. For new bee like me initial setup could be a pain."
1,"The cost of the product is amazingly cheap but when it comes to print quality (especially color ones) are pathetic. You would often see double lines/edges after you print it.Since the initial unit cost is less, HP has covered it nicely by comprising on the cartridge life. You need to be prepared to buy new cartridge after every 30 pages of color prints. Which does not make it value for money, especially when a branded cartidge comes at 750+ INR.I almost forgot to mention that you can't control the scanner from the mobile app. It simply doesn't support this model. The only thing you can do through this app is scan from mobile. It is not disgusting but rather a receiving product branding. Why would customer's use the app and th printer if they ultimately have to scan through the mobile? It is such a cheap business strategy and that's why HP sucks in Printing business and Cannon soars.Hence my suggestion would be, shell out more money and go for Cannon Inktank printers. I have that one , it surpasses my expectations in terms of print quality and maintenance."
1,It‚Äôs money down the drain. I‚Äôve had the printer for two months and it‚Äôs been a frustrating mess. It‚Äôs constantly smeared ink on the document or had paper jams. It‚Äôs a terrible printer. Or perhaps I just received a faulty one. It‚Äôs been a battle with HP‚Äôs customer service to get any sort of help in the matter. We‚Äôre still waiting for a technician to call us.
2,"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive."
3,"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this."
1,"I bought this printer for home use purpose but unfortunately this was not up to the mark. Its very expensive if you count Print. for Both Color and Black new cartridge - it had just given me around 50 pages print that also BW and both cartridge empty . Than i filled them with Ink because buying new cartridge is very much costly. After 2-3 refill now both the cartridge stopped working .. Till date i took around 100 to 120 Page print and believe me even if you don't have high use of Print ,, Never buy any cartridge based printer .. Never Ever.. Today i bought another printer which have ink Tank so that can be  less costly in compare with this printer.Never buy this . For me its costs around 60 rs per page  :( After just 3 month use , i am throwing this out."
3,"I have booked so many things from Amazon, thus time I got a faulty product. HP Deskjet All in one printer came early for my home usage, easy to install but paper jam issue occurred. Waiting for repairing my product by the Brand. Hope it will get cured soon. Otherwise I like to replace the item. There are options to give rating for the product, print quality, but what should I give? I don't even get any print from this newly purchased product."
1,"No extra positive point over other printer-scanner.First thing you need internet all the time for everything with this Printer.You need to download the driver, which is free, but that does not work properly, most user unfriendly software.Ink runs out just after 50 pages print.You can't just just just just scan a piece of paper without internet.Even if you provide everything to this piece of sh*t, even if the device showing ready with green mark, always shows ""Scanning is currently unavailable"".No physical button for scanning, always need to run through software, which does not work.Worst product and software by HP.I tried contacting HP many time, none of their troubleshoot worked."
3,"Most irritating part is that sometimes it doesn't print after we give a print from Windows 10 Laptop.Then on restarting the printer it start printing those prints.Haven't tried that much from Mobile but until now it has printed every time I gave print from mobile app.Good print quality for documents.Average print quality for Color Photos.Good only if usage is less, else it is irritating due to its slowness and issue of not printing every time we give a printout"
1,"Purchased this HP DeskJet 2723 All in One Wireless Inkjet Printer on 14 February from Amazon.in. It was easy for setting and first printing and scanning. After the first experience the printer was constantly making printing errors paper jams, extreme slow network printing. I am using Wifi 2.4 GHz but the data transfer from PC to printer through Wi-Fi is extremely slow. Some times I need to spend half an hour to print a single sheet by multiple time restarting and connecting.A non reliable product from HP..."
4,paper feeding is an area of improvement . ALSO there should be an inbuilt incentive to return the cartridges when fresh cartridges are delivered like a credit shell which can be utilized for next purchase.the current process is too complicated.
1,Be warned that this printer sucks like big time. It's only been 10 days and I have started facing issues with it. The printer does not spool any paper and indicates that the paper gets jammed...Feel like throwing this crap product in trash. NOT AT ALL WORTHY BUY.
1,"Installing it needs quite a patience. I had to watch couple of youtube videos to do it correctly. Its very cumbersome, took almost 90 minutes.Post installation also it shows multiple errors about paper setting, cartridge settings etc , some days its a pain to use it"
1,"This printer has wasted my time. It is horrible to setup jn laptop and once the setup is done, instead of printing, it asks to setup again. I have never been able to print a document from laptop till date.Each and every print requires multiple attempts. Finally, after struggling with it, I always end up at the xerox shop.It prints the wifi direct password and information page using colour again and again. Most of my colour ink has been wasted because of that.The HP Smart user interface needs a lottttt of improvement. It has very fixed controls like you can print only pdf files and photos. I cannot print my word docs and slides unless its converted to pdf."
4,Printing is easy. Print quality is great..Color cartridge that comes along runs out too fast. Just in 3 or 4 pagesBlack cartridge may run for 40 - 50 pagesthe cartridge refill is quite expensive compared to other hp printers.I am impressed with the wifi and smart apps linked to this printer.. however it comes with a cost.. approx INR 15 to 20 per page in cartridge
1,Very expensive  you can not take more than 100 print from 1 cartridge setAnd cartridge is not easily  available in market last 15 days i am looking and I got only 1 black and white colour cartridge is not available any where.
4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it‚Äôs quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won‚Äôt work and give communication error.‚ñ∂ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.‚ñ∂ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don‚Äôt print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.‚ñ∂ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6.

No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1.

Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can‚Äôt return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance üòûüò©üò©. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn‚Äôt work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
2,"Regret to buy this Printer. There is no background light in the display. Very difficult to see what is being displayed. Print quality & Copy quality is worse than the HP Inkjet printer which I have been using. Duplex printing is not working. Since I started using the printer after the expiry of the return window, I could not return the product."
3,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
5,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
1,"Worst printer, printing quality is low.Toner come along with the printer is used one. It list only for 400 pages.If you want to buy new toner, it cost around 5000 rs and it gives only 1500 pages.To costly to print.I didn't recommend this printer.Worst customer care service.Compared to this taking prints from out side is more economical."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
5,"It  easily scans pages even if slightly oversized than A4. Smooth operation, with no risk of paper tear at high speed of scanning.  Features like Auto rotate pages, auto blank page delete, page straighten, conversion formats - searchable PDF, Word DOC, excel make office life a lot easier,"
5,Very useful product... Saves a lot of time but file size is too large and the scanner can't be shared over LAN. Detecting blank page is not very accurate. Overall good product but expensive.
5,Little expensive but makes your work a lot more easy. Definitely recommend it for all small and medium offices
5,Very Nice product üëç. You will be satisfying after investing money no any regrets after spending money
5,scanner is user friendly
5,Good product. Easily connected to macbook
5,Good scanning speed with clear image quality scanner
5,GOOD PRODUCT
5,good product
5,I want to replace my adapter of that scanner machine. Because it is not working.what is the customer care number
1,The product is very slow. Takes 10 to 15 seconds to scan a single page and at this cost u can buy two scanner and printers which aren‚Äôt portable but surely works faster. The products drivers and softwares are on a CD!! Who in this era uses laptops with CD readers. If a consumer is buying 11000‚Çπ portable scanner it is not a wrong assumption to make that he or she is using a very sleek modern age laptop which this product is totally useless with. And how amazon baits you into this is by saying that u cant return this product u can only replace it with same product!!! Total wastage of money
5,"If you have a fast life where documentation is a main factor all the time,or if you have to take important documents from here to there,this is a perfect item for you. Simple,fast and very easy to use. You will get options for scanning. Both side scan will save your time and effort. From voter card to old document,you keep a copy of everything in your laptop. Just plug and play. Or you can install povided software. Driver of the scaner should be installed first. It is a recommended product from me."
5,Easy to use.  Now due to coronavirus physical courts are closed and efiling cases are started.  This product is easy to use and scanned legal size papers both side at a time.  20 pages are automatic document scan is also most useful feature of this product.  Plug and play.  I suggest every advocate to buy and use this product
1,"False Discounts.Seller has no responsibility.They sell,do not provide warranty card or details by Amazon's funded sellers.Amazon leaves it to yourself to resolve.The customer care acts as big dada.This is second time I have faced Amazon for their profit are encouraging sellers to sell anything."
5,Have been using it for three months. Very fastband smooth operation. Double side scanning. Excellent ediiting by the accompanying software.
5,QUALITY IS GOOD.SCANS TEXTS SUPER FAST üí®.PICTURES TAKE LITTLE BIT OF TIME.PICTURES QUALITY IS RESTRICTED TO 600PPM.GO FOR IT.
5,Excellent Product
5,Very useful. Scans what and however you want.
5,"It‚Äôs made in Japan product , so no worry about quality and durability. Just Plug and Scan"
5,It is a very good product. Picture quality is so clear and easy to install.
5,Very fast scanner. Both colour and black and white are available.
5,"Very good product by canon, you can easily handle it."
5,"For dedicated scanning, quick,efficient, easy-to-use"
5,VALUE FOR MONEY AND TIME SAVING
5,sir cannon find scanner power and the cables is error
1,Third class item
5,Portable scanner for legal paper scanning.
5,Amazing product. Very compact and fast. Resolution is also appropriate. Delivery was on time. Probably the best of all I have searched in the Amazon.
5,Amazingly quick. If you change the setting to 150dpi. Takes 3 to 5 seconds. Clarity is good. Automatically saves in a folder date wise.
2,It was just like an opened and used one. Nothing in company's original packing. If Amazon wants its name its ok but manufaturer's original packing must be there. It makes difficult to furtger sale the product
1,This scanners should not be used as ADF and should not be loaded with more than 1 or 2 papers at one time. If u load then the paper which are loaded will get ink smears on the top side. Thus the original documents will be damaged. If u want to scan one after another paper then it is suitable. Not an ADF as described by canon. Leave alone 10 papers. It is not possible without damaging the originals
2,First of all build quality is very poor.It takes time to scan. Provided micro usb cable which does fit in the port.Had to purchase one locally to install.
4,Some colours can not identify by scaner and it's giving black and wilhite picture finally
5,Scan quality and options are very nice. It does a takes a little time to scan which is fine as its dependent on the DPI settings you need. If you are an artist or designer it will definitely serve your purpose. Works nicely with Mac
5,Works amazing.
2,Installation CD is not working
5,Great
5,Good Quality Economic scanner for A4 size
5,Nice canon
4,"Hi Friends it's most popular hp multifunction laser printer because,.1)it's packed with 12A Universal Toner which gives more print,s than any other printer2)No more maintenance compare to other printer3)best in quality printing4) low cost of printing page5)cost of Toner refil is low cost and it's easy6) it's towers type design and build qulity is excellent .7) U will start u r small Xerox business withe this printer.But1) it's price so high..2) no wireless printing3) no duplex printing"
5,Very nice product from hp . Easy to install. Working very nice . Print quality is very nice .

3,Printing problem..  see attached photograph of  print out.....I have checked with new cartridge it is working fine...
5,Hp 1005 printer quality really good and easy use and maintainI have purchased with discount 15499
5,ProsSuper print quality.Low mainatanance.Hp and canon both companies invented this technology.

1,my hp printer is dead now which is deliver on 17-08-2018 . what do i do now. please call me
2,After 800 Page printed using last 3 months now showing big line on the pages of middle
1,Never buy a product from Amazon. First they sell defective product without any sort of quality test and to add salt to injury force you to go through customer support for the so called brand new product! Go the old school way of purchasing from local brick and mortar shops. Good for the economy too.
5,Good working very eye use
5,It‚Äôs a proven printer . It‚Äôs basically for commercial use so no body should have any doubt on performance . In Fortis Noida this model is used on every desk which speaks of its quality . Fantastic product for B&W quick printouts .
1,Amazon sale China product so many call to HP help line not responding so my advice to buying visit Near HP store and buy
2,"The printer prints well, and lives up to its reputation on that front. However, the scanner does not work with a Mac (at least for the new ones). I could not find drivers for the scanner online, so called the HP Support. After wasting a lot of time, taking my purchase details, serial number etc., they told me they did not have drivers for Mac. What do you do with a printer costing this much, and which is so popular (Amazon's Choice #1) if you have to scan using another printer, which is precisely what I have to do?"
1,"Pure china product, no quality at all.not worth for moneyThe product is not working and also customer care is helpless. I think it is HP's replica product from china. FAKEEEEEE"
4,"Product is good, print is good. Only drawback is Screen on printer is too small and don't have backlit so it is  not easy to read. Scanner don't have dedicated software. I have another HP deskjet printer which has a good software for scanning"
5,The printer is one of the most famous and affordable printer ever introduced by HP. It's a good investment considering the price and utility you are going to derive from it. Ink can be refilled easily. Toner is commonly available at all the regular stores. It's cost effective and print quality is also good. Speed is not great but not that slow to complain about! Scanning is very slow and didn't find it much effective. You also cannot scan legal size papers so please bear this in mind.
3,"Everything is great as mentioned by other reviewers. One BIG issue, it doesn't have driver support for Mac OSX so unable to use scanner feature. Printing works fine. I would not have bought it had I known this earlier. Not recommended for Mac users."
5,"It is good quality printer, I am using this printer for last 3 years in my office also. In office we use it roughly. Now I purchase it for my home @ Rs.14499/-"
3,Price is high in jan 2015 the same product I purchased in 10840/- rs without any offer and now this product rate is 17400/- rs.Other then that every thing is good.
1,"Waste product, scanner is jammed. Bought just a week back in prime Day sale. Was not expecting this from Amazon. Now should go through all hassles like connecting with manufacturer and stuffs. Even return window is closed with in a week. I would not buy anything from Amazon again."
5,"Got delivered within 12 hours of placing the order,that too in lockdown situation.The product is as usual AUTHENTIC  and  the printer has print,scan & xerox in black inkThis product is cost effective and hardy for heavy office use and is indeed value for moneyThank you seller for Authentic product and thank you Amazon for quickest delivery"
4,"Cannot comment on durability as its still new. i bought the product based on the reviews, assume its good. with everything wifi these days not having wifi is a problem for me. I thought i could have paid more and got a wifi enabled one as well as the dual side printing, which is very tedious if you have to do it few times. Drive installation is a challenge with HP website popping up quite a few windows to get the installation right.. Scanning is a separate software which comes with the HP pack itself."
4,"The only thing I don't like about this HP MF Laser Printer is its high price.  Otherwise it is excellent for my requirements connected with print, scan and copy.  Easy to operate is another excellent thing about this machine.One drawback I recently faced is that sometimes scanning wont't work.  I have to switch off my system and printer from electric connection and start fresh again.  When I do like this it works."
4,"I have purchased this as shown discount on HDFC credit card rs 1000, and 1750rs on credit Card EMI discount, but I found originally rs 1000 discount on Credit card, Bcoz, they charged 199rs processing fee, +18% GST and 1.25% interest + GST on that also, over all about rs 750.So got rs 1000 discount only.About the product is very good, but for delivery I have to call many time, and the courier person refuse to deliver the product, I have to complain and got the product next day, while I am a Prime member, but here also found no benefit of Prime membership. so I have given 4 star, not for product due to service.Product deserves 5 star."
2,Cartridge not working. It's look like a old catridge. Just I did the 50pages catridge drum was spoiled..totally disapoointed. This much cost not satisfied with this catridge .. look like old catridge
4,"This is an excellent printer worth the money, great build quality does the job absolutely well but I realized within a day it is almost impossible to get the scanner working as I am a MacBook user. There seems to be no driver available, HP easy scan, Apple Image Capture none of them recognizes the scanner. I am returning this product with great disappointment but the product is absolutely bang for the bucks."
1,Please don't waste money on buying this model..I am getting an error code while printing.To solve this I contacted HP help care but delay in services..
5,"Easy to install , robust build , you can repair it not need to change the printer if something goes wrong as previously I bought a Ricoh printer at 6k and after a year I had to bought this beast. Please go on buying without thinking if u need it."
5,"This is purchased for my brother. He is start  the new shop ,he need to Xerox , print and scan for customer requirement. It's installed easy and use easily. Print quality also amazing . This product also taken less area compare to Xerox machine. My brother also happy for this multiple function printer."
4,"I feel reget when i know that there is no warranty card inside box of this printer item. As a result of this ,i will be experience when the printer is facing problem.  I was placed the order along with waranty card cost and payment also made.So, if there is possible way ,pliz send me warranty card ."
1,"few days ago i noticed that serial no. of hp printer purchased is different from invoice, i complain on toll free no. and he send a link by masseage , for sending photo of invoice as well as of printer, and i send it. but no responce by amazan, i have send many email as well, very disappointing. please do need ful."
1,Video Player is loading.
5,This printer is one of its kind on its price range due to its durability and performance all along. Though cost is bit high but it reflect as money back once being in work place to address all our needs
5,"Unless you know how to install and set it up, it can give you nightmares.Once installed, it works like a piece of cake.Use the universal printer driver from HP for best results.(windows only)"
5,"Easy to use..Easy to refilling cartridge..Print quality is best.With compact body and weight less, helpful for portability.Thank you amazon for fast delivery and safe delivery and for offers.. On sbi."
3,Needed local guy to install. Company guy don't turn up. So better buy locally
5,Yes
5,"The product remains best for lady 3 years. I have two machines. Both work fine. Only drawback I observed was if you give more than 10 copies, it stops almost 10 between pages."
5,"Don‚Äôt buy xerox machine, buy this printer , This is an amazing printer with copyr , i am using in my school as i am a school owner n from last 6 month not a single issue with this printer. we use to print 1000 of qus paper every week ."
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
5,"I originally bought a HP printer and had a seriously hard time trying to get it working with Windows, Mac and Linux computers I had. One HP software would detect the printer and would ask me to install HP smart which would just fail to detect printer and ask me to connect it even when it's connected just fine.Canon on the other hand was a breeze. You don't even need any additional fancy software to work with it. Windows works out of the box and for M1 Mac, I was able to get it working just fine on Big Sur by using the driver ""MG2500 series CUPS Printer Driver Ver. 16.40.1.0 (Mac)""There are cost concerns compared to HP with cost of cartridge, but I'd gladly pay more for the cost if it means good compatibility as I really don't want my mom to struggle with her printing setup with some proprietary 3rd party buggy software that HP expects you to use.Canon integrated nicely with the OS and even passes error messages on the OS level directly so that you know what's wrong and even opens a browser tab with a guide on how to fix whatever it missing.The software is just excellent and I'd recommend everyone to buy Canon printers for home use. They're just better."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Good printer.I bought it for ‚Çπ2000/- only and had got ‚Çπ700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ‚Çπ1300/- .Prints pages at ‚Çπ0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that‚Äôs how all the cartridges are. I‚Äôll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I‚Äôm still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I‚Äôll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
3,"Printer is good in quality printing and scanning even it's easy to use But cost of ink with its validity is very poor , so it cost very much for printing one papar and ink only last for 50 page printing on black white and colour. Also this printer have no wifi and Bluetooth connectivity hence we need to use wired-computer for printing and scanning.But as a emergency tool in home this is useful for  scanning and sometimes printing important and needy documents. So it was very useful for me during COVID19 lockdowns"
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ‚Çπ2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) üëåüëåüòÄI have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also there was no external packaging done on this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it‚Äôs a very of so let product
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
1,This product is a scam because it‚Äôs ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don‚Äôt get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
1,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.Think well before you buy this printer."
4,Very good product for day to day use...not for commercial purpose... Must have device in every home...Its print quality is good.but it take time to print... Overall it is quite durable and easy to install...
1,"Guys, if you see the tag bestseller and are buying it please research first. It is very tough to use never gets connected easily. 1st time it worked well and then it never ever worked seamlessly, it always had an issue of connection or ink etc. As soon as i used, it got over in hardly 40 pages and i thought something might be the issue, however second time the same thing happened third time again  .. i called hp people and they told me it is only good for some occasional printing ...like 1 or 2 page occasionally. If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2. I am extremely displeased with the product as i believed in hp products... so if you have to print 1 or 2 pages you can go for and then also 1000 bucks for 40 pages is the worst investment you'll ever do..."
3,The scanner device is satisfactory for use .I use it primarily for the annual Jeevan Pramaan Life certificate.With the Up grade of the Jeevan Pramaan web portal this devise  is no longer compatible with the upgrade and hence rendered  redundant . Unless the manufacturer/seller Register the devise with the portal this devise is of no use to any senior citizen who wishes to obtain a digital Life Certificate from the Jeevan Pramaan portal.

5,"I bought this for registering my father's jeevan praman . Installation is easy just follow the instructions and proceed, packing and delivery was good. If you are looking for a fingerprint scanner then just go for this device i will recommend to check the supplier of the device before buying I purchased the yukonics mantra device."
5,"It was easy to install this on both Windows 10 PC as well as Android phone. Product worked well as described.  There is no Type C connector bundled with this product. If your phone has Type C connector, you have to use an adapter"
5,Item is good but amazon commitment 1 year RD free it‚Äôs not free. And RD help line are dos‚Äôt help.Thank you Amazon for fast delivery.
5,"1. Easy setup instructions.2. Although after installation of scanner, the test chiws about 60% clarity of scan, it works well online when put to biometric use.3. General quality and packaging of product is very good.4. Go for it."
5,An awesome product. The scanner was installed with ease. It scans fingerprint and compares with aadhar card finger print  and was done successfully . Thanks.
4,Good product. You can buy it without any hesitation. Just make sure that your mobile is not Rooted (Hard Reset not done) when you are using it with your mobile.
1,USB cable not fitting properly stay loose. Seems  very poor quality. Better you test and purchase from offline market.
5,Excellent except the cable which needs to be C connector
5,I am first time user of this product and successfully carried out the authentication at windows 7 through this instrument Yukonics-Mantra MFS-100 in first attempt. I felt it's easy to use that's why I like this product. I did not find any reasons to dislike this product so far.
5,Rd service is activated. It worked for jeevan Pramaan and bhim.

1,"To capture finger prints , but no use , complete image not covering.Please take back."
1,"Seller send the old mantra machine , the lalble is not seen in the back ,it's not working ,I have not expecting that"
5,Everything was already fixed we just install the app and use it...
1,I need to be change the same product due to unable work....pls call me
2,"It seems to be already used item, it's a dummy product"
1,It's not easy to install. In fact it does not work.Seller's name is misleading.
5,Love This Product!!!!
5,I use to nokia 5.4 Cable to different Type C
2,"I got misguided by the reviews that it's a plug & play device & we can generate life certificate in 5 minutes, NO it's not that easy.No one tells that you have to buy the RDA service in reviews without which the scanner won't workThe jeevan pramaan app doesn't work with Android 10,(although the scanner works with Android 10, but ultimately no use as you cannot do anything with the jeevan pramaan software) I learned it the harder way by wasting my day trying to fix the issue with my & then my wife's phone.My next try was to install it in my office computer & I was not successful due to the software restrictions as it could not read the RD device, so couldn't install it there too.Tried home laptop which said some add ins needs to be installed, so failed there.Lastly requested my landlord for his old mobile which has android 9 & finally did that.Most important the customer care of Myntra is the worst I have ever seen, the lady stressed off & disconnected my call without listening to my problem.Honestly if u can manage without buying then don't buy,it has its own complications.You can still buy if u have a phone which is not android 10.All the best."
5,I used this product to get EPF's Jeevanpramaan Certificate not only for myself and my other Senior Citizen friends at free of cost. They cannot go long distances and pay Rs. 60- at E-Seva Centers. I did not face any problem as yet.
5,Nice product for aayyushman BharatIt's valuable device andMantra support team are very nice helpful for customer
1,"PMGDISHA site coming error "" invalid value for fCount"" very very bad experience."
5,"I used this for my aged mother to generate her life certificate and it went through but with a couple of hiccups. First, you need to install related drivers and software for which the seller should provide the links in the description. I had to do some research of my own to find out and not everyone can do it. The scanner times out very quickly if the person takes time to focus on the exact point in the scanner. This can be a problem for old people as they are not used to such things and take time. It suited my requirement and should work for everyone if you have the correct drivers and software."
1,"I will suggest PLZ DONT BUY it. Because seller gives it already registered and you don't know where the device is registered. You will get 'fcount' error. If error is at Aadhaar website, mantra will tell to contact aadhar, if error is with 'CSC my account' login or with DigiPay then Mantra will advise to you to contact CSC. If error is with EKO Mantra will tell you to contact you EKO. But Mantra will not check if error is with their own registration process.Why device is being sold as pre registered?At the end you will get a Jhunjhuna (Toy) after spending amount more than Rs.4000"
1,High chance of getting defective product and the same happened to me. Here the main problem is seller(Aastha digital) want customer to do the self shipment if you get the defective product which is totally unacceptable also there was no exchange option. We buy product online because of easy return policy but this was exception. Finally thanks to Amazon who helped  customer for the refund but I want Amazon not to encourage such seller who wants customer to do self shipment.
1,Waste of money. Believed reviews that it works with jeevan pramaan app. NOPE. Does not! Now will have to run pillar to post with the bank to get the life certificate done for my senior citizen parent. People need to write truthful reviews!
4,Excellent product. Just download and instal the driver and RD software from Jeevan Praman website. Then plug in and within 5 minutes you can have your desired process complete.
5,"I have used this iris scanner for my mother‚Äôs Jeevan Pramaan digital life certificate very successfully in a few seconds at her bed as she was 92 years old and bedridden. Yeaster years ‚Äò laborious , very cumbersome and hated physical appearance of pensioner has gone , thanks for this device and our Prime Minister."
4,"Good product, I used it to generate Jeevan Praman (Life Certificate) for my grandfather. It works perfectly with mobile but faced issue with the installation in PC. There should be an installation manual for PC inside the Box. Overall good experience. I have successfully submitted the life certificate of my grandfather over mobile app of Jeevan Praman with the help of this."
5,Installed the drivers as mentioned in the userguide from their web-site.  Device is instantly recognized and accepted by Jeevan Pramaan site.  Was able to scan senior citizens IRIS for Digital Life certificate for whom finger prints were not working
5,"After running around the pension disbursing bank and post offices where my mom's fingerprint didn't work, finally decided to buy this device. Wise decision. Got it done in 10 minutes via windows 10 laptop. 5 stars, awesome and absolutely worth it if you want to save the hassle dragging old people around in the midst of covid and want to get it done from the comfort instead."
3,"Had bought the product specifically to generate Jeevan Praman Certificate.  Had also called the manufacturer to confirm.  However, the product is NOT supported on the Jeevan Praman app on android."
5,The gentleman Mr Pawan is very helpful. Guided me completely and I was able to successfully generate Digital Life Certificate using this Mantra gadget. Mr Pawan helped download software and use laptop to do the same.
2,this device not work in csc and digipay and any type of AEPS.ITS WORK ONLY IN JIVAN PRAMAN PATRA.
5,Awesome to use..user friendly and readily authenticate my parents life certificate ... happy to use... must buy...  :)
2,I purchased it my family personal usage as and when their finger prints not captured. Unfortunately I couldn't be able to test it myself. Simply waiting for situation to arrive.
5,Very good product and can catch iris scan within seconds.  Very effective for generating online life certificate/ jeevan praman patra.
5,This iris scanner working fine with Windows. I submitted my father's life certificate connecting it with my laptop.Now It's working fine with android phone also.
3,"USB port connecting to computer is not Good gets disconnected when lifted, One needs to catch it stifly and get it operated."
3,The scanner could not be made compatible with umang app though we are using finger bio metric successfully.Returned by speed post  no ETO59346418 on 17/11/2020
4,"Nice working device for my emitra login, my biometric problems solve it. Very nice in this price 4130"

5,Excellent
5,"Worked perfectly well for submitting alive certificate through Jeevan Pramaan when finger print scanner did not work. For installation, guide downloaded with Jeevan Pramaan is most helpful. It is value for money."
1,"Not in use from the 1st day not meet using standard of software for which purpose I have made order for both 2 items,  pls returns both item and return my money"
4,Good working. sensor capturing and quality off detection is good
5,I used this product for jeevanpramaan digital verfication since fingerprints were not matching. It worked perfectly and the device is good to purchase.
4,Great product however the same could have been a lot better in case you could have highlighted the process of installation of drivers
4,Worked fine with Jeevan Praman but it works only on Computer not on android phones. I guess they have not designed it for android.
1,"Dear Sir/Madam,This device is not working properly. I have called to Mantra guy to help me. He checked and advise me to replace the device."

3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ‚Çπ, which is excellent value."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
1,"It was really waste of money, I ordered this 1 year before... The printing speed is very slow, everytime errors are coming, it is automatically taking print size as 5*7, catridge is costlier... Only postive part is wifi connection and we can easily give print from mobile also ...I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLEASE DON'T BUT AND GET SUFFERED LIKE ME"
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
5,"Received product yesterday in brand new factory packed condition, Amazon using biodegradable packing materials which was heartening to know.No problems with the setup, it was a little lengthy though. You have to install the HP Smart app and it guides you effortlessly through the entire set up process.Printed a few pages till now, print quality in Draft mode is also good.Will review post after more usage.Very satisfied with the product as of now."
1,"Print quality is sub standard, unlike my earlier HP printer which I used for 6 years. Double side printing is very painful, and doesn‚Äôt happen automatically. One needs to pull out the paper and reinsert it in the tray. It‚Äôs user unfriendly. Paper input tray is of very low quality and the paper crumpled sometimes when it goes in for printing.On day 1 itself I realised that this printer model was a mistake."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
5,"Replaced my earlier wired HP inkjet as it was taking up too much space next to the computers and printing from different computers was a pain, with the cable having to be switched between machines.Very happy with this new 2778 printer, installation on my iMac was a breeze which was a surprise and it has worked very well since then -  more than 25 pages printed without a glitch, yet to print from phone though.Overall the printer has delivered on our expectations of an easy to install and use wireless printer.Amazon service as usual was excellent and now my default choice for office electronics."
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
4,"Compact design, easy to use, take printout and xerox. One thing I noticed that, the color cartridges provided in the box, using this we can't take printout of more than 30 papers. As it's mentioned, 150 papers we can printout in color. Don't know whether it's cartridge issue what they have provided or printer issue."
1,"Don't buy thisThis printer might cost you less but cartridges are too costly.Buying cartridges are like paying EMI for a costly printer.So better buy ink tank printers, b'coz it doesn't have cartridges and ink is less expensive compared to hp 682 ink cartridges."
1,It's only printing color even if you select black and white. This is seriously I didn't expected before buying and now I am clueless also tried contacting support but they also don't have any fix expect trying reset and asking to use laptop instead of mobile.
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
1,"The printer does not work. Installed all apps, all drivers yet it shows offline and is not printing at all.Do not buy. Waste of money and support is non-existentOne star because it won't let me give zero stars"
4,"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.Trust the above helps."
3,Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge  empty.
3,"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives."
1,Worst product . Especially software for this product is very poor.Need 8 apps to run a simple printer.That too tiring steps that will take almost one day for successful installation if you are lucky.Cursing my self for buying this.Please buy some other PrinterI am using printers for past 20 years never faced such a tragedy
5,Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece
3,This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.
1,"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever."
1,"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support..."
1,"It so harrasing ,not easy to set up ,it takes more time and total disappointed"
5,"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour"
4,"Printing quality is very impressive, you can choose up to various printing modes like draft, normal & best, you can directly print by hp smart app from your phone, there is a mobile fax option too, Printing speed is also fast but not very fast, main problem I m facing is an alignment problem in an input tray, whenever I want one print out then additional sheets also come in an output tray automatically sometimes though they are not printed but still it's frustrating.  Overall it's a good printer by hp."
1,Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.
5,Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.
4,Very good printer at such cost by hp but the ink is somewhat costly as per printing cost.also if printer is not used for some days then paper jams occur.
1,"I received a very  cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know  that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it."
4,"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA  and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance."
5,"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice."
3,Not see
1,"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product"
5,"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer."
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP VERY SATISFIED AND ULTRAFAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I ORDERED IT YESTERDAY IT SHIPED TODAY AT 12:02 AM AND GOT IT TODAY AT 4:42 PM VERY ULTRA FAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ALL THE FEATURES ARE EASY AND USEFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING MY COMMENT TRUST ME IT IS THE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP NO ISSUES WITH HARDWARE SYSTEM ALSO ACCEPTS IT EASILY YOU CAN BUT IT
5,Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.Pros1. Value for money in this price range2. Easy to install3. Looks great4. Touch displayCons1. Copy quality is not sharp2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.3. ‚ÄúPrint anywhere‚Äù feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.
1,"This is one of the worst printers from hp. Installation, connection, ease of use everything is fine. BUT IT JUST DOES NOT PRINT IN COLOUR. I have been wasting days with tech support trying to resolve the issue, but nothing has happened till date. I asked for a replacement, they behave as if they can't even read that line. They just keep making case ids after case ids.I've been using hp printers for over 2 decades, never had any single issue with any of them.IF YOU WANT A HASSLEFREE PRINTER... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER... REST IS YOUR CHOICE!"
1,"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.who is responsible for it?now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days."
5,"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.Overall a good buy."
5,Product is really good but No extra Black ink included
5,"I bought this product during Great Indian Sale. It's value for Money. everything is fine, just you need to go through Installation Video which can be found on YouTube.Also you can control this printer using mobile app which is nice."
1,"Overall NOT Recommended.-Dosent work with Phones-Useless App doesn't work at all-Scanner is not working, App Dose not Support.Wasted loads of time make it work.-Dead Slow Printing-Does not work with Phones."
2,"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great."
4,Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.
1,Update: Never made a worse electronic parchase than this. Tray became faulty within months and since then it's showpiece. No attempts to repair helped and cartridges would dry up without use. Paper just wouldn't go for printing.HP seems to be selling cheap quality printers only and better to go for other brandsExtra-black cartidge is missing as mentioned by many others in reviews. Really wonder why Amazon is failing to take steps against the false information without a proper escalation
4,"Positives:1) Easy install and use, less weight/handy.2) hp app3) 3in1 is good (scanner, printer, photocopy)Negatives:1) Not value for money for occasional users.I bought it for school online class purpose to take prints but it‚Äôs expensive2) Poor customer care -tech support (launched case number but never get call until I tried them)3) Printer comes with demo cartridges for only 12 to 15prints (colour may be 12, B&W may be up to 16)as per customer care , we need to buy two cartridges separately (Rs1600),4) full cartridges may give less prints as well and no instructions (may be 300 to 450 as per others experience)5) Printer papers auto process sucks sometimes, (not often so far),6) I tried to take small size print from smartphones but size selection is intermittent and only  A4 was option (most of the time)My suggestion: if you don‚Äôt use printer daily, please don‚Äôt buy to save your cartridges cost (cartridges may get clotted if you don‚Äôt use ink often)"
1,Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.
3,"Cons:Not worth the money. Problems with colour printing-sometimes it prints in grayscale. Driver needs to be reinstalled every time this issue occurs. There is no option to select colour and grayscale separately which means a colour document will always print in colour. It uses a lot of ink for colour prints. The power connector is loose.Pros:ADF is a great feature reducing manual work.Overall, if you do not need adf, you can always go for a cheaper model like 2621. HP as a brand is good and my previous model 2545 served for 7 years without many issues but this model certainly has its own problems and it is definitely overpriced."
1,"Have never came across such problematic printer...It feels like it likes to throw variety of errors.....At first it failed to recognize setup cartridge (that came along with printer). I had to replace the printer. The replacement piece that came in worked extremely week for first 4-5 days. Then after printing 1st page of the file, it starts throwing in error of 'Paper Mismatch' every single time...I mean almost printer uses A4 sheet and I know where do I need to change the page size ....I changed page sizes everywhere and then I realized its only accepting A5 size... After 2 days session with HP support and Amazon customer care where they made me go through what not change in settings ..I gave up and thanks to Amazon they agreed to refund the money.Never going to buy HP printer again..."
4,"For wireless printing 4178 is good option with adf feature. Specially Direct-WiFi (no wifi router needed) feature is very good & most convenient.Only con is color printing as its not yeild the no.of prints as they mentioned in specs. Only black&white yeilds good as mentioned. When compared to 4123, this 4178 comes with 682 cartridge(twice the no.of prints to 805 cartridge)"
4,"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.And yes, i like the touch screen as well."
4,"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine"
1,"Really bad quality product from HP and pathetic support.The paper gets jammed every time I try to print. (Se picture attached).I contacted HP support, the support engineers came after a week. They initially said a part is faulty, but later didn't change it. They said its fixed no need to replace the part. In few days the paper jam issue started happening again.Its really painful to contact, first they will make you talk to a bot. After 30 mins of chit chatting with the bot, if your session isn't timed out, you will receive the support phone number."
1,I get the order faster and then i used it for 2 days and 3rd days it's stoped working i don't know what's to do whether take it to hp care or return to get replacement .... I taken it to hp care .. after one week they handoverd it to me and again it's stoped working .....In hp care they suggested me to DON'T BUY AT ONLINE . Because they have sample items ... Ugh worst ever ..
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ‚Çπ2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) üëåüëåüòÄI have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also there was no external packaging done on this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it‚Äôs a very of so let product
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
1,This product is a scam because it‚Äôs ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don‚Äôt get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
1,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.Think well before you buy this printer."
4,Very good product for day to day use...not for commercial purpose... Must have device in every home...Its print quality is good.but it take time to print... Overall it is quite durable and easy to install...
1,"Guys, if you see the tag bestseller and are buying it please research first. It is very tough to use never gets connected easily. 1st time it worked well and then it never ever worked seamlessly, it always had an issue of connection or ink etc. As soon as i used, it got over in hardly 40 pages and i thought something might be the issue, however second time the same thing happened third time again  .. i called hp people and they told me it is only good for some occasional printing ...like 1 or 2 page occasionally. If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2. I am extremely displeased with the product as i believed in hp products... so if you have to print 1 or 2 pages you can go for and then also 1000 bucks for 40 pages is the worst investment you'll ever do..."
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
5,"I originally bought a HP printer and had a seriously hard time trying to get it working with Windows, Mac and Linux computers I had. One HP software would detect the printer and would ask me to install HP smart which would just fail to detect printer and ask me to connect it even when it's connected just fine.Canon on the other hand was a breeze. You don't even need any additional fancy software to work with it. Windows works out of the box and for M1 Mac, I was able to get it working just fine on Big Sur by using the driver ""MG2500 series CUPS Printer Driver Ver. 16.40.1.0 (Mac)""There are cost concerns compared to HP with cost of cartridge, but I'd gladly pay more for the cost if it means good compatibility as I really don't want my mom to struggle with her printing setup with some proprietary 3rd party buggy software that HP expects you to use.Canon integrated nicely with the OS and even passes error messages on the OS level directly so that you know what's wrong and even opens a browser tab with a guide on how to fix whatever it missing.The software is just excellent and I'd recommend everyone to buy Canon printers for home use. They're just better."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Good printer.I bought it for ‚Çπ2000/- only and had got ‚Çπ700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ‚Çπ1300/- .Prints pages at ‚Çπ0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that‚Äôs how all the cartridges are. I‚Äôll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I‚Äôm still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I‚Äôll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
3,"Printer is good in quality printing and scanning even it's easy to use But cost of ink with its validity is very poor , so it cost very much for printing one papar and ink only last for 50 page printing on black white and colour. Also this printer have no wifi and Bluetooth connectivity hence we need to use wired-computer for printing and scanning.But as a emergency tool in home this is useful for  scanning and sometimes printing important and needy documents. So it was very useful for me during COVID19 lockdowns"
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
1,First day first showüëéüò°Very DisappointedAs you see colour where not properly set as pictureTotally worst
3,The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving.  One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.
4,"Nice product, all function available, futuristic product, wit wifi , scanning copy, multi function.Only cons is the set up via mobile app it is easy for setup watching youtune video.But for window installation it is difficult, as it is a new printer,hence driver properly not worked, u need to take guidance to HP customer support.Hp customer support was very helpful  guided me 2 hrs & get the installation completed.Ink consumption still not rated, as 1 week only i am using , quality & usability aft insatalltion is pretty good for home use.."
1,"1) Printing SPEED per page VERY SLOW,2) PRINTING COST OF PER PAGE VERY HIGH, TOTALLY BOGUS / MISLEADING INFORMATION CIRCULATING  BY HP THROUGH FABRICATED ADVERTISEMENT REG HP PRINTER 2723 JUST TO MISGUIDE CONSUMERS/ CUSTOMERS.  HP-805 CARTRIDGE COST TOO HIGH BUT PRINT OUTPUT VERY POOR ...ONLY 25-30 Pages. ALSO 805 CARTRIDGE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE EXCEPT AMAZON. PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS SAME AS PURCHASE OF ELEPHANT FOR PERSONAL USE !!!"
1,"Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive"
1,"I am sorry to say that the Amazon is not helping me to replace the product,  I know product is ok but it's not compatible to me and this can be fairly good to return it.Kindly help me for the same"
1,i hardly took 20 prints in of blackand 5 prints of colour .. and now low cartidge indication is happening..u people have given used cartidges.. how can cartidge finish in so less prints..better not to take this kind of printeri have done a mistake i think by taking this printer
1,"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.  It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly.  First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.  I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer."
1,"Printer worked fine for the first few weeks, then suddenly it stopped working and required me to setup the printer again - when setting up the printer it requires you to use ""SETUP"" cartridges that come with the package, when I had to redo the setup even though I've used the ""SETUP"" cartridges which had worked and printed documents - the printer now does not recognise them and refuses to print anything. Now it's just an expensive piece of plastic sitting on my desk, complete waste of money. Even reached out to HP support but no resolution."
1,The printer comes with a faulty cartridge which cannot be replaced through the service center. The service center people would try to avoid any issues regarding cartridges. HP customer support and chat support are useless. They would try to fool you if you contact them. The Chat executive had asked me to contact Amazon regarding the Cartridge issue on an HP printer. No service personnel assistance for setting up the printer as promised in the Amazon ad. Color print is not 100 pages as promised it is less than that. Every time the Cartridge depletes you need to substitute with a new cartridge costing Rs 747.
5,It is too automatized to troubleshoot. The HP support sucks.We do not have any troubleshooting help on the printer screen and the app errors are generic. Could get one page printed after wasting 3 days in troubleshooting. It again got stuck with another error the next day! Cannot return this anymore so stuck with this one
5,Amazing Printer Cheapest Price Wirless
1,"This Printer is very difficult to setup on a JioFiber router. Otherwise as well, my previous HP Wireless 3540 Series printer was much easier to setup on Wireless. This is just a crazy hassle, trying to connect through a SmartPhone. Please dont buy printers that have setup through a SmartPhone. It has crazy combination of buttons you have to press, to enable to Setup mode. The previous HP 3540 printer had clearly defined buttons that defined what was what."
3,It is not nearly as easy to install and use as it says. I have not been able to connect it to a JioFibre Wifi network.I use the in-built HP wifi network. I can‚Äôt print using my phone connected to the internet because my phone has to be connected to the HP wifi and not to JioFibre.I don‚Äôt know whether it is a restriction of JioFibre.
4,"1. you can print directly from any machine / mobile connected to same network2. you can also email an attachment to print from anywhere.3. it is not necessary to always change network to print.4. Mobile setup is easy, use HPeasystart setup from hp page to install in windows,  if you messed up anything, use HP print and scan doctoroverall a good buy. For new bee like me initial setup could be a pain."
1,"The cost of the product is amazingly cheap but when it comes to print quality (especially color ones) are pathetic. You would often see double lines/edges after you print it.Since the initial unit cost is less, HP has covered it nicely by comprising on the cartridge life. You need to be prepared to buy new cartridge after every 30 pages of color prints. Which does not make it value for money, especially when a branded cartidge comes at 750+ INR.I almost forgot to mention that you can't control the scanner from the mobile app. It simply doesn't support this model. The only thing you can do through this app is scan from mobile. It is not disgusting but rather a receiving product branding. Why would customer's use the app and th printer if they ultimately have to scan through the mobile? It is such a cheap business strategy and that's why HP sucks in Printing business and Cannon soars.Hence my suggestion would be, shell out more money and go for Cannon Inktank printers. I have that one , it surpasses my expectations in terms of print quality and maintenance."
1,It‚Äôs money down the drain. I‚Äôve had the printer for two months and it‚Äôs been a frustrating mess. It‚Äôs constantly smeared ink on the document or had paper jams. It‚Äôs a terrible printer. Or perhaps I just received a faulty one. It‚Äôs been a battle with HP‚Äôs customer service to get any sort of help in the matter. We‚Äôre still waiting for a technician to call us.
2,"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive."
3,"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this."
1,"I bought this printer for home use purpose but unfortunately this was not up to the mark. Its very expensive if you count Print. for Both Color and Black new cartridge - it had just given me around 50 pages print that also BW and both cartridge empty . Than i filled them with Ink because buying new cartridge is very much costly. After 2-3 refill now both the cartridge stopped working .. Till date i took around 100 to 120 Page print and believe me even if you don't have high use of Print ,, Never buy any cartridge based printer .. Never Ever.. Today i bought another printer which have ink Tank so that can be  less costly in compare with this printer.Never buy this . For me its costs around 60 rs per page  :( After just 3 month use , i am throwing this out."
3,"I have booked so many things from Amazon, thus time I got a faulty product. HP Deskjet All in one printer came early for my home usage, easy to install but paper jam issue occurred. Waiting for repairing my product by the Brand. Hope it will get cured soon. Otherwise I like to replace the item. There are options to give rating for the product, print quality, but what should I give? I don't even get any print from this newly purchased product."
1,"No extra positive point over other printer-scanner.First thing you need internet all the time for everything with this Printer.You need to download the driver, which is free, but that does not work properly, most user unfriendly software.Ink runs out just after 50 pages print.You can't just just just just scan a piece of paper without internet.Even if you provide everything to this piece of sh*t, even if the device showing ready with green mark, always shows ""Scanning is currently unavailable"".No physical button for scanning, always need to run through software, which does not work.Worst product and software by HP.I tried contacting HP many time, none of their troubleshoot worked."
3,"Most irritating part is that sometimes it doesn't print after we give a print from Windows 10 Laptop.Then on restarting the printer it start printing those prints.Haven't tried that much from Mobile but until now it has printed every time I gave print from mobile app.Good print quality for documents.Average print quality for Color Photos.Good only if usage is less, else it is irritating due to its slowness and issue of not printing every time we give a printout"
1,"Purchased this HP DeskJet 2723 All in One Wireless Inkjet Printer on 14 February from Amazon.in. It was easy for setting and first printing and scanning. After the first experience the printer was constantly making printing errors paper jams, extreme slow network printing. I am using Wifi 2.4 GHz but the data transfer from PC to printer through Wi-Fi is extremely slow. Some times I need to spend half an hour to print a single sheet by multiple time restarting and connecting.A non reliable product from HP..."
4,paper feeding is an area of improvement . ALSO there should be an inbuilt incentive to return the cartridges when fresh cartridges are delivered like a credit shell which can be utilized for next purchase.the current process is too complicated.
1,Be warned that this printer sucks like big time. It's only been 10 days and I have started facing issues with it. The printer does not spool any paper and indicates that the paper gets jammed...Feel like throwing this crap product in trash. NOT AT ALL WORTHY BUY.
1,"Installing it needs quite a patience. I had to watch couple of youtube videos to do it correctly. Its very cumbersome, took almost 90 minutes.Post installation also it shows multiple errors about paper setting, cartridge settings etc , some days its a pain to use it"
1,"This printer has wasted my time. It is horrible to setup jn laptop and once the setup is done, instead of printing, it asks to setup again. I have never been able to print a document from laptop till date.Each and every print requires multiple attempts. Finally, after struggling with it, I always end up at the xerox shop.It prints the wifi direct password and information page using colour again and again. Most of my colour ink has been wasted because of that.The HP Smart user interface needs a lottttt of improvement. It has very fixed controls like you can print only pdf files and photos. I cannot print my word docs and slides unless its converted to pdf."
4,Printing is easy. Print quality is great..Color cartridge that comes along runs out too fast. Just in 3 or 4 pagesBlack cartridge may run for 40 - 50 pagesthe cartridge refill is quite expensive compared to other hp printers.I am impressed with the wifi and smart apps linked to this printer.. however it comes with a cost.. approx INR 15 to 20 per page in cartridge
1,Very expensive  you can not take more than 100 print from 1 cartridge setAnd cartridge is not easily  available in market last 15 days i am looking and I got only 1 black and white colour cartridge is not available any where.
3,"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.3.  I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a  complete fiasco.17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn‚Äôt read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.Review Update - Jan 24- it‚Äôs been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I‚Äôll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn‚Äôt detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I‚Äôll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I‚Äôll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn‚Äôt sync or connect, it‚Äôs a waste! It‚Äôs like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you‚Äôre looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That‚Äôs true.HP customer service experience is 0/10."
5,"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.Pros:-1.Wi-Fi Range:-Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)2.Automatic Updates:-Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi RouterA Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.CartigesBoth cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper butI am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc."
4,"The cost per print is very high , I hardly went up to 40 pages and the black ink is already depleted ! , the connectivity is not an issue seamlessly connects with your devices , but the rate at which the ink depletes is very fast , this is suited for people who print once in a while and also when they need the print to be confidential which you don‚Äôt get in an internet centre. Strictly not for people who print a lot."
3,"I bought this product and returned it after 4 days.Coming straight to the pros and cons :Pros :1.Its quite affordable in a price range of 5000-5400 ,given the multi functionality (print,scan and copy)it performs true to its claim.2.Its super light to carry around. Can be moved around easily if needed as it uses cartridge which is dry and does not form bubbles as in an ink tank printer.4.Gives good prints both coloured and b&w.5.You have the choice of purchasing either of the cartridges, depending upon your usage,  b&w or coloured,in case of find it costly to buy both,and still it would function absolutely well.6.Gets easily connected to a laptop by the USB.CONS:1.The most difficult part of this printer was connecting it with the mobile wifi or wifi direct as they call it in the absence of any physical technical support and one gets immensely hassled in this process,as they do not provide any demo or at home technician service to help you connect for the first time.It requires a whole lot of things like router,dual band wifi, and though they claim and try to enable an easy connectivity with wifi,which it isn't at all.After some time you almost give up on trying to connect with wifi and simply get your work done by directly connecting with laptop which it does good .2.It is not mentioned anywhere on the Amazon app the cartridge that you get with this printer are only dummies meant for 20-25 prints ,and not the real ones.And so you need to buy them along with this printer if you have got to print at least 50 pages.3.Though its inexpensive ,but its costly in the long term as it gives you only 100 bw pages per month with a newly bought cartridge which is way less than the ink tank printers.So this printer is budget friendly,and a good deal for low usage like occasional homework and assignments of children,or ticket prints etc."
5,"very nice air-printer.. no need of wire connection..  i connect it to my wifi router (wireless) & use that printer with all devices (mobiles, laptop & computer) which connected to wifi..."
1,"Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well.  Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement."
5,"The printer is super cool. Obviously the printing cost is very high, no doubt. But at the same time you should know how to get around it. I refill the cartridges myself.. And to be more specific, I refill with the original ink bottles HP Gt 52, yeah.. The print quality is awesome. If you want to further reduce the cost, use the local ink bottles that you get at around Rs 100 for 100 ml bottle. That would be much cheaper. One bottle gives a print capacity of 1000 pages. One time refill would give a print capacity of 100 pages. So technically, the print cost is reduced to as low as 10 paise. I am still using the cartridges that came with the factory shipping and have already printed more than 500 pages consuming only 50 ml of ink.."
5,Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.
4,"Very nice product. Wifi configuration took time, but results were amzing. printing directly from phone, makes life more easy. i  was expecting this to be duplex printer, but didnt find that feature, need to explore more.Recommended product for home purpose and small office purpose, Copy and scanning is easy through HP smart app on Mobile phone. Overall nice product"
3,"I have been using this printer for the past 3 months and I am writing this review now as I wanted to give the other customers a very genuine review on this product after using it.First of all, this is not absolutely the best printer for daily use. The one and only reason for that is the ink price.The HP 803 cartridge used in this product will always give you a headache while buying a new one. The cartridges set (Black n color) will cost around 1800 rupees which is quite high for an ordinary customer, and the cartridges last for only 200-300 page prints in normal quality. There is an option to refill the cartridges after it is exhausted but it won't work after 2-3 refills probably.I used this product for my project printouts, study material printouts, making copies of documents, bills, etc in a regular basisfor the first time after the cartridge was empty, I was able to refill it using the ink bought from the Amazon.in site itself and was able to take another 150-200 printouts before it was empty again. The 600 rs ink bottles are enough for 10 refills. But on the second time after I refilled and started using, after few prints the cartridges were spilling out more ink and sometimes no ink at all which resulted in incomplete printouts and waste A4 sheets and i had to buy a new set of cartridges which was nearly 43% of the product costPROS1. Excellent Working2. Good Quality Printouts3. Easy to use3. Copy/Xerox Feature (Both color and B/W)4. Wireless connectivity (Very easy printout using phones directly: Requires HP Plugin installed in your phone)5. Good HardwareCONS1. Cartridge too costly"
5,Does what‚Äôs it‚Äôs intended to do . Setting up the app took a while but now it‚Äôs smooth . Print quality is better in this price range . Haven‚Äôt used it much extensively but whatever I did was smooth.
4,"Cartridge rate is higher except that all are nice. It is nice printer for home use and price is also affordable. If the price rate is adjusted than this is the best wireless printer. It can scan,print and we can do xerox in it."
4,"I don't know why the seller has listed this product as HP Deskjet 2622, even though what I received is 2600.Anyways, for Rs. 3999/- it is not a bad product at all. Every feature is the same as mentioned in the description. The printer comes with 2 cartridges (color and black) that was very easy to install. The print and copy quality is perfect, and fast also.I am happy with the product, apart from the fact that it is giving some problem in connecting with my phone. Once I was able to print directly from phone, and the next time, the phone showed the printer is unavailable.OVERALL: Very good product for the price."
1,"If you have no where to waste your money, this is the one. Most irritating product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The functionality of printer is hilarious and if you don't have patience, my advice, refrain from purchasing. The ink run at super fast like Jamaican Usain Bolt speed.Note: Amazon you should publish my review or don't wala such product."
5,This printer HP Deskjet 2729 is really amazing. It's printing quality of both color and black &white is very very clear and good.I like printing quality of this printer.Dislike about this printer is that it is pretty slow during wireless connectivity.But I can say that just go for it...
1,"The product is not recommended at all whether you use it for home or office.best are ink tank printers. twice or max thrice the cost but worth it and effective plus cost saving.Color photo quality is worst of all the printers (Epson, HP, Canon) i have used on kodak paper.Cartridge charges (rs. 700 each) are too high and yield is like max 40 color photos/print and 80 Black n white prints.I had some urgent need of photos so took the printer in use and all i can see is the pink color photos.Very bad experience with HP this time."
1,Worst...after 20 pages b@w ink showing low...nd dat was only documents print out..
4,"Product is really nice, I have booked Canon first, but it was faulty. So ordered this HP2622. What I felt is the plastic quality is much better in HP.First when you on the printer, connect to the printer using Wifi, then one page will open there you can connect the printer to Wifi networkOnly problem I noticed is when I put single paper, the paper does not go properly inside and the printer throws feed error. After multiple attempts (30time) figured out that the paper to be inserted below the roller to have proper feed or else the roller will pull the paper one side, this is definitely some problem to fix or what I dont know"
2,"The printer is good, but the black cartridge got over in just about 45 pages printing, not satisfied with this though, haven‚Äôt counted on the colour printing yet..."
4,"Many buyer's here complaining about wifi setup for printer is hard, Might be taken note of by HP. With hp smart setup application for mobile and desktop/laptop it was seamless experience and really easy to setup printer + wifi for wireless priniting without any  trouble. Infact, mentally i was ready to face same problem but no such problem faced by me luckily.As of now, I am not using any USB cable to take my printout, Everything via Wifi, Be it from laptop or Mobile. In case, Anyone still feels the same issue, Refer to the blue book titled Reference and Support. On 1st page in bottom you will find the solution itself.Cons -  For now only 1. Explained below.I gave 4 star because, Ink is fast depleting property be it color or black. In case you have daily print out of anything more then 5-6 pages, Don't opt for it. Otherwise, Excellent for Kid's homework and minimum printing job."
3,I've been reviewing it . After my 8 months of usage . This is a low load printer . I never expected slow print from this product . I've been looking for better one again .Pros:* Speed in Connectivity* Easy to access at low price* Compatibility* Easy to equip and less weight.* Colored printsCons:* No double side  print available* Sometimes we've to wait to load* Maintenance is bit high compare to laser jet
3,"I bought this printer for home use. The cost and features are good. You can print from mobile as well. The wireless printing works very well. The printer is quite good.Now comes the catch. The cartridge cost. HP 803 original black and color cartridge costs anywhere between 1200 to 1500 rupees. Contrary to the claim I was able to print not more than 50 pages before the ink dried. It could be that ink dried due to non usage for couple of months. However, the cost of new cartridge is mind blowing. Looks like companies make money out cartridges."
5,The printer is good obviously so no issues there but initially i was given a used product which i wasn't happy with i got the replacement and it was great. I liked the product as its compatible with all my devices as long as it's connected to my wifi. Without the wifi i can connect the printer to my laptop and presto!! It works. My advice please look up the setup videos by hp before you get started.
3,"HP needs to work on improving customer experience. It's a nightmare trying to get the drivers and getting the WiFi feature work with the product. I choose to use cable for quick printing. Print quality is ok ok. Packing was good. Comes with cartridge. For scanning, one need to have hp snart app installed and nedd to use it for giving scan command to printer."
1,"We received this product and unfortunately did not start using it within the 10 day period allotted for returns. So once we tried to use it we had continual issues printing, it actually didn't print. After many calls with HP support they agreed to send a technician after they realized it was a printer defect. The technician came and then said he would have to come back with a replacement part. After that visit he no longer responded to our calls or texts and we've been unable to get a hold of anyone from customer support. We've had this printer now for a month and it hasn't worked nor are we able to get it repaired or replaced. Terrible experience."
2,"ProsGood looking with pure white exteriorEasy to installConsLonger lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pagesBulkyWhite color sure looks good but prone to getting dustyAlways takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone appI used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in thatCartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP onlineNo resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer"
5,The colour cartridge sent with the printer is defective.So either replace the whole order or replace the cartridge by tomorrow.
3,"Printer is really good, easy to setup and operate. Very handy with print copy and scan.Unfortunately soon after printing two papers, I started seeing problem with the default cartridges that came with the printer."
5,This is my favourite product that I brought in 2019. Easy to install and use and the wifi  connectivity is also strong. I brought it for printing homeschooling materials. And it‚Äôs working efficiently plus it‚Äôs budget friendly when you manually refill the ink. You need to be a little patience with the ink filling thing. Scanning & copy also functions smoothly.
5,I bought it bcoz of brand name.And it provedGreat print quality but it could be better.It's easy to install.Easy to use.Effortlessly print.The cartridge should print more pages.The cost per print should be less.Overall it's best in its price range.
1,"Review after 1 year of use:Whenever I give any command to print, I am not sure if it will print. Sometime paper will get stuck, or printer won't connect with phone, or command is given but nothing happens.If I have to take a print for class then I ensure to get it done a day before because there is no sureity if it will print the moment you need itVery unreliable product! Would give it 0 star"
3,"A good printer for beginners or school kids, because it's very simple to setup and use, but the high CPP @Rs.5 to Rs.7 is not worth it. Will discard it very soon and get an ink tank all in one with auto duplex ADF. Don't let the low initial cost fool you, at best you can get about a yield of 100 b/w pages, so unless you absolutely need a printer immediately and can't afford the initial cost of an ink tank, I would strongly advise against buying this."
1,"I made a mistake... humble request to you please don't purchase this...Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....Cartridges too costlyInstallation easy but print yeild is very low.Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifiI requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now..."
4,THE printer is fine .service was good but the problem is..IT IS BETTER TO BUY A NEW PRINTER THAN A NEW CARTRIDGE..i always use genuine things but this printer is only worth 3 colorful pictures..that is it..even black and white depletes before 40 prints..if the pictures are not that colorful then may be a few more..HP or any other printing companies needs to see this..the manufacturing costs for this cartridges are not that much..but still it is unfairly priced..you can not heavily print at all not even lightly..that is the problem..it has to be more efficient
5,I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.
1,On receiving the printer I was able to connect the printer wirelessly and print copies without any issues. But the second time since I moved out to another Wi-Fi network I am unable bring the printer to set up more and connect the printer to the network. I tried a lot but unable to get the printer to connect to Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi light keeps blinking does not stay on.Can someone help me? I cannot return the product as the return Window is closed.
3,"Would suggest look for a notch upper hp printer. , this is for the basic home user , has WiFi connectivity for easy prints directly from mobile . Installation took a bit of time with WiFi not getting connected properly but once done then it was working fine . Too many pages get sometimes stuck though"
5,I bought this product yesterday and tested all its functions which are working perfectly. Results are very good. So far so good.......rest time will tell
1,"This is very worst product. Cartridge stopped working after 20 page print. And help line said go to service centre which is more than 90 km, and they said buy new cartridge which is 1800 INR cost. Now think guys printer is 3000 n cartridge is 2000. Don't buy this hp is robbing Indian customer s.Anyone can call meI want to sell this dabba for 1000. 2 months old.PRAFUL9818868839"
1,"Basic problem? The paper in mechanism. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN PAPER. Its a vertical feed at the rear, and horizontal out the front. Either the paper just dosen't get pulled in, OR gets pulled in titled to one side (right) and hence the printout is skewed, OR (USUALLY) the paper tilts a bit, then remains there, while the printer prints (no idea on what!) And shows the job done. In last 40 tries Ive only managed 1 print and 2 photocopies. DON'T BUY."
1,"Within 2 hrs of purchase i realized and experienced that running cost of 6075 is BOMB. In a rate of if you keep printing 10 pages Blank and white and 5 color daily., cartige will drain out in week. So, maintenance Cost would be 6,000 Rs per month., as good as buying monthly printer.Other issue:Makes lots of noicePrinting is not crisp, has shadesSlow printingDemoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast."
4,"It was easy to install. Took just 15mins to complete the process. Print quality and speed looks okay.They provided only starter ink cartridges so I suggest people to not judge the printing cost per page by using starter cartridge.Need to check after using originl cartridge for the cost effectiveness.Overall, I found this printer good. It is the only model with auto duplex (2 sided printing). So I am happy about it."
1,"Cartridges are outdated (just like filament bulbs in the age of LED bulbs). Check the cost from HP itself:Cartridge: Rs 5 per page (see below for more)Ink tank: 18 paise per pageThere is no comparison !!The above cartridge cost as per yield of the HP 682 cartridges ~ 480 pages (Black & White) & ~150 pages (Colour). This is like a petrol car giving 30kmpl in city traffic. It is less than half. If you get 200 pages (black - Rs 792) or 75 pages (color - Rs 972), you are lucky.HP is fooling people by still selling the cartridge printers. These are best seen in museums.~*~"
5,"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done."
1,"The printer looks fancy, but thats it, never expected this kind of cheap quality of printer from HP ever.1. Printer says dual band refused to connect to 5G network, it would find it but wont install/ configure it. Finally connected with 2.4G network.2. Scanning issue- sometimes it will do it sometimes it wont respond, as if it has a mind of its own3. Software/ firmware issue in the printer, checked through its EWS page and firmware seemed updated still the printer will just become numb suddenly, in 3 days i faced it 3-4 times, the power button at the back will not work as well and it just sits tight. Only option is to remove the plug from power outlet, then reconnect and works well but again you dont know when it will stop responding.will not recommend this to ever, the paper extender to hold the paper is quite filmsy and the paper will fall on ground after it complete this printing."
2,"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel"
5,"I ordered HP DESKJET PLUS INK ADVANTAGE 6075 yesterday (July 26, 2021). Got delivery today from Amazon.Came in a nice box, the overall quality for HP Box was decent. But, Amazon wrapping on top was a sheer disappointment as it was partially opened. Hence, I recorded the video while unwrapping.Installation took about 10 to 15 mins.Had to be careful while Installing the cartridge, as the second lid isn't intuitive enough to open. Thought I might break something.Works very well via wifi connectivity, as well as USB. I prefer wifi as there are several devices at home.PROS:Simple to installVery good quality of scanning and printingThe HP SMART app is superb - simplifies workflow for PDF creationVery cheap cartridgeAccepts various paper sizes also good for photo printingAutomatically goes in sleep mode, if idleGood wifi rangeCONS:The cartridge which came in the box seems to be running out quickDoesn't support wifi 5 GHz"
3,"This is sort of a ""fancy"" printer overall, but its performance on printing speed, color print quality etc. are just average. I tried to take a color printout of a picture and it took more than 4 minutes to do so. For black print also it took irritatingly long time. Though this printer looks ""modern"", it's the slowest home-used category printer I ever used.One big gripe(atleast for me) is that a long print-paper cannot be fed inside the sheet-feeder(picture attached) and hence the feeder can't be closed and so can't be printed. This is because of the sheet-feeder design & its size of this particular model  unlike conventional top-loading sheet-feeders of other printers where long print-papers can be kept in the feeder and printed."
1,"Worst product from HP. Even though I managed to print 3-4 pages, the printer failed to initialize right from the moment I switched it on. Even HP engineer visited my place that too AFTER 8 DAYs(lodged complaint on 9th Nov 2020 and he came on 18th Nov 2020) of complaining and gave up on it saying we'll issue a DoI and take the product back."
4,"I had an HP printer in the pre-historic times of deskjets - more than 20 years back & am aware of the ""perils"" of owning one - ink drying up, dusk magnet that eventually clogs up the printer assembly, very high running cost.Anyway, necessitated by the vicissitude of the current time, decided to take a plunge.Was primarily looking for a WiFi printer and found this to be best reviewed and among the most affordable range.Here's the review after using for a month:Goes for it:*Very compact and relatively lightweight*Excellent integration of printer functionality on application that you could install on phone or via PC*As some other user had commented - a ""drawer for paper"" is a good idea*Printer functions on expected lines - nothing stellar but gets the job done - for printing, copying and scanning*Found the scan to print feature helpful for scanning multiple pages - also has a Bulk Scan job feature which I plan to use in futureGoes against it:*Printer set-up esp. the wifi connection bit was clumsy and definitely as per the set-up guide script so users have to be careful*WiFi connectivity is clunky to say the least and the connectivity often goes off*For connecting via USB to a PC, one needs to delete the WiFi Printer set-up first and start over"
4,"After reading the mixed reviews about print quality ,installation and catridge issue, I was a bit skeptical to buy this printer. But after using the printer for a week now, I can say it is the best choice I have made for my needs of home printing. The printer is  very nice, sleek and is light weight. Installation was bit of a struggle as there were no clear instructions and I had to google to figure out the steps after the app is installed on phone. But once it got connected it has been running smoothly. I have used all the functions - printing, scanning and copy and all are working smoothly. I would recommend this printer for people who wants a printer for home i.e for school project/ scanning/ copying few documents. It occupies less place and not very huge as compared to other printers."
1,"I was delivered HP 6075 printer with only one black cartridge installed. The colour was missing. A brand new hp printer does not have cartridge installed, else how will we know if the cartridge inside is genuine not refurbished. Amazon support team is excellent in helping with return. But this kind of experience is bad. Eventually I will be buying offline from one of the malls."
3,Bought this close to 10k rupees. Overall it‚Äôs for home purpose only. Print quality is good.I went to high price just for duplex printing.Con:Scanner is just ok. I say it has bad scanning capability. 300ppi scanning is good. 600ppi takes 40 seconds. For 1200 ppi one must die and take rebirth to see it.Don‚Äôt thing scanning is fast like what we see at xerox shop
4,The printer does the job as in the description. The reason i chose this model was only because of the auto-duplex feature which saves a lot of time and effoet. No problems whats so ever. Had a complication in setting up the printer for wireless access. The connectivity is not consistent. You need to assign a static ip address to the printer for it to work properly. Apart from the wireless connectivity there are no other complaints I've.
5,"This is the ideal printer for home use, I print about 5-10 pages a week. Very easy to setup wirelessly and the functionality of remote printing via mail attachment works flawlessly.With the right print settings, the ink consumption can be minimised and you can stretch the output of number of sheets.Paper tray, wireless connectivity, remote printing, Smart App are just some of the features that are very functional and useful."
5,Package was perfect üëçüèª and very easy to setup. Scan the QR code and all install the app and register. And The rest of the job done by itself.Coping checked ‚úÖ scanning ‚úÖ photo printing ‚úÖ photo coping (xerox)‚úÖ
5,Installation was smooth and didn't take much time to sort things out and make it working. HP smart app is pretty user friendly that way.4.2* from 328k reviews does say the app is good enough to do what is expected out of it.My 5 stars is purely on the value for money it carries with wifi and auto duplex features.
1,It's printing cost is very high.It Cartridge cost approx INR 800/=each (Black & Tri Colour).Company wrote that u can print 480 pages from Black Cartridge and 150 pages from tri colour but it's not true. After 200-250 print app will show u very low on ink.I will not recommend any one to buy this product.
5,Pro'sThe size is very sleekThe light indications for various events and errorsThe paper tray has a yellow light indicating the tray is not closedDuplex printingGood quality photo printsEasy to Print using phoneCon'sThe cost of ink and prints are bit expensive but that a case for any inkjet
1,"I thought the low cost printer, might be equivalent to 4279 printer. But this one very downgraded model. DO NOT BUY and DON'T GOI Feel bad  why brought this mud boxits worst both catridges gone with in 180 pages :( worst .. don't gooooBetter go for INKTANK printers"
4,Good print quality and easy to print.The main disadvantage with the printer is its very hard to install/Setup. Got no installation manual with the printer..and the one available online doesn't help.with the wifi set up. Had to do lot of trial and error methods to make the printer work on wifi.Also no specific set-up videos onYou Tube for this particular model.
1,"Warranty mentioned in description is 1 year but actual warranty is 8 months on HP site. HP will not correct warranty detail even if you provide all detail like invoice copy and GST bill, they will register your case but will not act upon it.About printer: Average print quality but printing cost is too high. After printing 3 pages HP smart app started showing warning to change ink."
2,"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two."
1,Had to return because the product was damaged and had black ink marks
1,It's Very Bakbass Product I Ever Purchased From Amazone. The print Quality is very Pood.  It's had not All colours. Bad Product. Plz donot purchase it. Go for another lazier prienter. I want my money back
5,Received the product in good condition.. Packing was good.. Print quality is also good.. Fully satisfied with product.. Would recommend others to buy Hp products...
5,"Wanted a printer for home and home office use. Max usage of 200-300 pages per month. Delivery on time, setup/installation was simple and without any hitches. Printing smooth, already printed 200 pages with the cartridge supplied along with the printer. Overall satisfied."
4,Please HELP!I need a cover for the printer HP Ink advantage 6750 I just bought from Amazon. I dont see a compatible cover online for this printer model.
1,Never buy inkjet. You will keep buying ink cartridges too often. Buy laserjet or inkfill.
5,"First day usage review:Got early delivery. Thanks to Amazon.Packaging was good and device is very light weight.Configuration and setup was very easy.Tested colour, B/W printing - working fine.Tested photo copying - working fine.Tested scanning - working fine.This works fine with USB cable and WiFi on Windows 10 laptop.Working good from iPhone mobile too.Thanks to HP and Amazon."
3,The cartridge printed only 20 black pages before starting to display that printer is low on inksThis is suprirngly odd as I bought same printer for myself 1 month back - and the Catridge is still running good despite being printed 200 pages.
5,Very good product and fast scanning. Great thing is that you can connect directly to LAN and use it from any computer on the LAN. No need to connect the scanner directly via USB.Technical support from Kairee is very good
5,"Speed, Accuracy, Clarity, Classification, Requirements and üíØ% satisfaction!"

4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it‚Äôs quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.FYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INSIDE BOX‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Printer2.

Tiltable control panel for easy access.11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don‚Äôt have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CONS‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won‚Äôt even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it‚Äôs a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can‚Äôt get everything in this range)4.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won‚Äôt work and give communication error.‚ñ∂ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.‚ñ∂ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don‚Äôt print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.‚ñ∂ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can‚Äôt return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance üòûüò©üò©. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn‚Äôt work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
2,"Regret to buy this Printer. There is no background light in the display. Very difficult to see what is being displayed. Print quality & Copy quality is worse than the HP Inkjet printer which I have been using. Duplex printing is not working. Since I started using the printer after the expiry of the return window, I could not return the product."
3,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
5,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
1,"Worst printer, printing quality is low.Toner come along with the printer is used one. It list only for 400 pages.If you want to buy new toner, it cost around 5000 rs and it gives only 1500 pages.To costly to print.I didn't recommend this printer.Worst customer care service.Compared to this taking prints from out side is more economical."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
4,Nice but it uses too much battery. Battery doesn't last long.
3,"A little about this printer:1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run."
5,"after sales service is pathetic, service center in faridabad is pathetic, useless service center, i had to wait for 25 days for replacement of defective cartridge. after sales service has to be improved, need to improve service centers.HP 2332 Deskjet Colour Printer is Superb, Fantastic, Excellent, very nice looks."
5,Excellent product with good well packed... Very very satisfied.... Print catridge cost also lower than any ink advantage catridge.... BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRINTER ONLY FROM AMAZON AS IN FLIPKART FAKE BRAND SOLD BEWARE...
5,Excellent product for home use....you can print around 120pages in black and white...and 100pages in colur...if you are rich then use new cartridges....all the times....but if you are not then...buy hp oroginal inks.....and fillup the cartridges...each time...with injection.....this will let you to print 6000 pages in 600Rs ...wherelse if you use cartridges...then you can print only 120pages in 600 rupeesThank you.
5,"Easily the best printer in this price range. Bought it for 3.1kHuge upgrade over my old printer. Fast printing speed, no smudges, extremely good print quality. The scan quality is also extremely good. Scanned images have proper color ration and reproduction.The setup took a little more time than expected. Other than that, awesome machine."
1,This was the worst printer i have ever ordered.  Please dont buy this product at all. This product's ink cartridge finishes in less than month and with less than 100 prints. And if you buy a new cartridge then it will cost approx 1300 rs if bought of hp. That means it will cost approx half of the printer. Which means 1300 rs for just 100 prints. I would rather get it photocopied from a shop instead. 13rs per page . And I'm also very disappointed in hp co. Which is producing this product.  And  please consult any printer seller about this product and you definitely won't find any advantage.Its totally not worth the money .
1,"The page started getting stuck from the very first day. Not a very good product from hp.As if having this printer is not bad enough the customer services sucks. It is like adding insult to injury. There is no way to contact seller to fix the issue, only channel of communication was Amazon's canned response chat, and that was pathetic as it didn't even give me option to list my issues.It just kept on cycling through the same responses.I'd give negative reviews if I could. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - NOT ONLY THIS PRINTER BUT THE SELLER AS WELL."
1,"Don't buy HP products. Learnt the hard way.Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions. HP customer care is absolutely pathetic. They will receive the call and pretend that they are not able to hear. So, forget any support from HP.Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.Also, preferably buy a wireless printer as that way you can try printing from your ipad or mobile other than you laptop, but for this wired dumbbox there's not much to do"
5,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well)  and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."
3,The look of the printer was great but the connection was vry poor when iwas connected to the laptop or phone . Other than the connection the remaining was great .
1,Product is not installing in my laptop. And neither I am able to replace the product nor I am getting any technical assistant help.
1,"Order was delivered in a day by Amazon. Great work. But the printer installation is so 90s work. You need to physically go to HP site, download drivers and complete the installation. Who does all this in 2021? But here, HP wants you to waste 2 hrs to do all of this. And then too, you cannot be sure that copies would be printed. Took me another 15 min to figure out why the hell scanner is working but printer is not- inspite of installing everything correctly as per the process. Absolutely disgusting. Pls don't go for this. Invest in buying somehting non-HP."
1,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn‚Äôt have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It‚Äôs the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn‚Äôt ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don‚Äôt buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."
1,The printer is worst.And not returnable or refundable.My 3100RS are wasted.Please whoever it is of you are reading this comment I request you to not buying it.Go for Epson or Canon or Brother printers instead of this.
4,"I just received my printer today. After printer set up and driver installation,  I am providing my review.  I am very happy with the packaging,  printing and xerox quality. Though scanning quality is okay, can't say it superb. To conclude,  good printer at INR 3,099/-."
4,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don‚Äôt go through but I think it‚Äôs a common software issue I‚Äôve faced with another HP deskjet printer tooI had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don‚Äôt have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
1,"Don't buy the printer, very bad experience over last two months.Update after using for few months:Print quality is getting worse despite running clean and alignment often with new cartridges.Both color and black printer cartridges cost about Rs 2500 each time since the default one that comes with printer doesn't last longer. You will end up spending several thousands of rupees on cartridges alone since this printer wastes ink and lot of pages with misprints as well as doesn't give good yield.I have been using several models of HP printers for more than 25 years.Doesn't work with Mac OS, works with Windows 10 only but takes a while to get the printer installed.Doesn't print anything some times.When it decided to print it takes forever to print a page most of the time.Doesn't get connected most of the time.Can't print resolutions above 300 most of the time.Haven't come across such basic printer in last 25 years."
4,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"
1,"The product isn't good at all. They don't have a return policy, it takes lifetime to print a copy incase it decides to print or else it doesn't majority of the times."
1,"This is about the HP AIO Desk jet printer  2332, I bought on Amazon  on 16th of Nov 2020.The claimed printer print yield is 120 pages Black & White.  Now, on 2nd of Dec'20, little over two weeks, I have so far printed about 55 pages , only text (no graphics so far) and Black and white.. and the printer reports no Black Ink.50 Pages per cartridge is atrocious; outright loot and doesn't even meet the claimed product specifications as per HP (120 pages). My print need is about 150-200 pages per month, mostly B&W.. and @ 750 per Black cartridge, every month I cannot invest Rs 1500 to Rs 2150 on Black cartridges alone... the Printer cost itself if Rs 3,000/-. HP IS LOOTING  CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. But this is too much...@ claimed print yield of 120 pages @ cartridge price of Rs 750, PP Print cost is 6.25. a local xerox company offers service at Rs 6 per page. What use is owning the printer?.stop buying HP anymore..  Loyalty doesn't pay"
5,Everything is good speed is good for black and white it takes 4 to 8 secs according to material you have to print and also depends upon quantity which you want draft normal or the high quality same for colour about 8 to 12 secs and scanner is also doing well use hp smart app for printing it is easy to use  you can buy ink from Amazon of wroth 400 and refills the cartridges easily even then buy a new cartridge of worth 8000 and after filling it prints about 120 pages and 80 colour pages one can refill. Cartridge in one minute it is very easy i print had 400 pages in one very good product when i go to buy it i also worry about the comments of another people who are saying it is bad but i think they didn't know how to use it don't worry and go for it if you are able to use it well then you find it best
5,Nice printer easy to use . Just install drivers before using in laptop . Got for only 3100 . I like the product as it is best for home usage but yes it is going to little bit costly in term of refilling.
2,"Too costly to print, with just 10-15 page of print, Bank ink is finished. Cartridge are 950 per pack which is beyond afford. This can be used for just scanning otherwise for print go with Laser or ink-tank option. Also their windows app from windows store or hp website for windows 10 is worst, not able to detect printer most of the time."
5,"About the model: HP 2332 and 2331 are same printers. The only difference is the body colour. Buy whichever is cheaper.A detailed review on the results:Everything works perfect from what I expected from this printer.Powered ON and could do a copy of my aadhaar colour copy in one button click.(Separate buttons for colour copy and b/w copy).Then, installed HP Smart application and printed (both colour and b/w).Installation gave me some troubles. After first of installation, the printer was not detected.I downloaded the HP printer drivers from different URL and installed it again.I don't know what made the change. It started working.But, I spent around 2 hours.We can scan up to A4 size documents. Allows to scan in three resolutions - 300dpi, 600dpi, 1200dpi.Scan with 300dpi itself is good.The pulling of paper is perfect - one sheet at a time in a clean way.Does not pull out more papers or no paper jam.So far I have printed around 20 colour copies, two A4 size photos and 20 b/w copies.HP smart application shows 50% colour cartridge remaining, 80% b/w cardridge remaining.Buy a third party refill ink kit (that is compatible for HP 805 cartridge).This will help reusing the cartrigde for 2 to 3 times.I printed photos on Kodak 230GSM paper. Reasonably ok quality.But, I need to print and check on other GSM paper to see if I get better results.Note: To protect the cartridges from ink drying out, they should not be left unused for more than a week's time.  In deskjet printers, Cartridges are the main challenge."
4,"Thanks Amazon and the Seller: Packing was good and delivery on time.Utility-wise, my needs are very little, like school assignment prints 2/3 time a week of 2/3 page.Light weight, decently good print and speed out.Original catridge colours are coming good.  Will have to see how this works over 3/4 months. It's just 2 weeks for me now.Saw a comment that the android app helps from mobile printing. But, the machine itself is not Wifi enabled. It is a basic colour printer, coming under Rs. 5k budget, which I got at Rs. 3.2K, I can only wish it was there."
4,I got 2 Cartridges with the Printer...one Black and One color plus I purchased one additional color Cartridge with offer...print scan and copy is very good quality for home use but for business use more good quality printer may be required...easy software installation and cartridge installation...Overall good Home use Printer in the market
4,Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.My advice is to go for a wireless one.
4,It's nice product for commercial as well as for private use...I personally used it...worth for money...but it is china made...and there is no bluetooth or wifi connectivity...so I feel this 2 disadvantages...but overall very nice product..go for it
1,"The first one I ordered came with a faulty cartridge rail, that turned on like it was going to explode. Replacement came everything worked, but broken paper feed tray. 2 small tabs that hold them broke loose. It's not made to last by the looks of it. The one print it did was dull on a brand new cartridge so I'm quite happy that Amazon has accepted the return for a refund. Kudos to Amazon customer service"
1,"I bought this just a month ago and it worked only for 10 days after that the cartridge problem started and it won't work. There is no error code that u can google or anything. It just won't print, no error no false code but it doesn't work. Really a bad product and I am not able to get service too!"
1,If there is no internet availability the scanner wont scan even though the printer is DIRECTLY connected to desktop.  The software hangs multiple times. Something urgent to print or scan then expect delays. All works fine till you reach your 2nd or 3rd cartridge then all these troubles start for software hangs
5,"Delivery was quite fast. Received the product in time. It's almost 3 months I am using this product and till now the experience is excellent.Print quality is excellent. Mostly used for A4 size printing. It Gives both options to print in grey scale and color. Was easy to install and start. Though, this is not wireless but gives to facility to scan and copy the documents and is best suited for household/school work."
4,"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future."
1,"Started malfunctioning from day one; Amazon replaced it, and the new unit has now started malfunctioning in less than 3 weeks time. As the return window is closed, we are unable to get the same replaced."
1,"Beware before purchasing.Only works in windows 10.7. if you have any other windows version or Mac os , it will not work. This is worst printer to be purchased."
4,"I did order for HP DeskJet 2332 All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer with 805 Tri-Color Original Ink Cartridge. Instead of receiving Tri-Color Cartridge, I had received Complementary Cartridge of both Black & Color Cartridge. Though I was not aware of the requirement of both cartridges for this printer, luckily received these two solved my immediate installation issue.Not sure that complementary is allowed for this item.With single or few numbers of paper in the input tray, struck up and the cross-feeding problem is noticed."
4,"It does what it says. It prints well, scans well & also copy well too. Its super easy to install. As the price is less, can't complain much but the printing cost is too high. Its good for occasional printing. I tried by printing color photos to glossy papers but the quality is not that good. Overall good experience."
3,"Printer looks premium,  gets prints faster and ecomonic. The main problem is the ink. I just took less than 20 pages and the ink got over. A new cartridge will cost u around 750rs. So for just 20 prints u have to pay 750 rs. Who will purchage for this kind of stuff. If i pay 1rs i will get a Xerox copy. The purpose of buying a printer is for our convenience.  Premium and build quality doesn't matter if the ink provided is such a rubbish. I will give 5 star for the quality of the printer and 1 star for printing."
1,"I bought it on 15th April, this was delivered on 23rd April 2021. Since then, I have hardly printed 15-20 pages and its USB wire is not working.Don't know whom to contact, I will try reaching out to HP, but you guys don't waste your money purchasing this.Thanks,"
1,Very disappointed.
5,High quality scann with great speedAnd very simple ADF Scann.Also hp provide the Redrsel pro appEdit text simply.Also Like packing is good damage free good luck to all can buy this product
5,The best scanner.
5,Very good
5,Good Product
5,"I had some hesitation on buying this product as there was no warranty support etc. The product came neatly packaged, and was delivered much ahead of the promised schedule.The product did NOT have a user's manual, but it was easy to figure out the operations. This product also comes up with a slide in which negatives can be firmly placed, which makes the whole scanning process easy and error free.In 5 days I could digitise around 800 of old photo negatives. This device requires a USB memory card, and stores all the images into this.  I am attaching two digital photos taken from old negatives. The original photo was taken in year 2001 at New York. Notice the colour difference among the two images. The green shade comes when negatives which are not of good quality (i.e faded out due to improper storing) are scanned."
5,I like it. I could recollect old memories with my children from the negatives (40-45yrs old).
3,Photo comes with green shade ...
5,Sooooper product. Does wonders.
3,Printer is good but ink runs out quickly especially Colour Cartridge ink.  The print quality is good.
4,"The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. It does the job. A couple of things to keep in mind:1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.Other than that I found it quite decent!"
2,Printing quality is not good as expected. Disappointed.
3,"Writing this based on 7 days use experience.Pros1. Wifi Printer, having scanner, copy and Fax at low price.2. App based use for convenient print, scan, fax.Cons1. Colour print quality is just average.2. Ink provided along with Printer can last only less than 30 color print.3. Print speed is very slow over wifi. May be 2 paper in a minute4. Getting connected to wifi for printing is a painPersonal thoughts- My use is only 20 page print in a week currently and thus can live with this.Those expecting quality colour print, or high speed printing or print requirement is too much may search for other option, as ink cost will be too high comparing to getting printing outside.Yet to print photo paper to assess quality.More review after new ink installation and few months of use."
3,"1,Can be buy for Minimal uses purpose.2, scanner and printing is slow but reasonable price3, Worsted connection with wifi,many time disconnected , again it will take more time bro reconnect4, Print quality good.5,I purchased only for ADF scanner. That fullfilled.6, I bought 3 days before (6/11/2020) so i don't know reliability.7, cartridge - I taken 10 colour print copy but cartridge ink level shows less than 50% . May be  i can take another 6-7 copy only."
1,It doesn't have a scanner. We purchased a wrong product.It is a total waste of money.
1,"The software is very buggy. Even if paired and connected via WiFi, it does not detect the other 5 in on state even if printer is on. When detected and given print command via mobile it takes ages to transfer a single page document to the printer, and then it prints only half the document wasting the paper.. really frustrated with the printer, wasted almost half day for printing a 1 page document yet no luck..Edit: Updating review to 1 start as even replacement piece was faulty."
1,Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting. Very confused whom shall I call for the remedy. Either buy in directly from croma or Hp they provide full solution till installment and extended warranty
1,"I am totally disappointed with it so I replaced it bt after the  replacement while the verification they made cancelled so the product could not replaced. I lost my money üò≠üò¢üò¢üò¢. And product is not working properly, while printing it takes whole papers and printing will be in the corner of paper."
4,"1. Suitable for small office and home office2. Scanner is good.3. WiFi connectivity is not great4. HP smart is a cloud based app. If you install HP smart half the drivers do not get installed. Reliability is low.5. HP support was very helpful in getting the application package/drives/installation for this device. (Alternatively you can look for drives/set up for Hp 4100 family series drives/app and install)6. Post installation of dedicated app and drives, the device is working beautifully."
1,"don't waste your money on this, within 10-15 pages your black cartridge will be over, and within 10 pages your color will also over, then after that, you cannot refill your cartridge, directly you have to purchase a new cartridge with cost 1400+ for 2 cartridges, wireless connectivity also not good, also it is very complicated to use, the best thing I can say about this is DONT PURCHASE IT."
1,"It's works very slowly , I don't like it ...I ordered it but when I connected it via wifi the name of this device is 4100 I don't understand what is happing here, bit confuse this product is real or fake the blue sticker which was their above it's surface in every product in the review. ...But in my product nothing shown like this..I don't no this product is real or not ?"
1,"Printing stop after in less than a month, though used for few times. Support we code does not function. It is decoration. Down time is more than two weeks now. One gentleman  came to attend, he was very positive, but the machine was online wrongly reset by the support crm centre. Hence needs a part. Part not available becos hp godowns have software malfunction. Better avoid this product. In the first month itself, more of repair request and downtime. The company is big as they do not care for retail customers. Internet dies not recognise printer though it says default printer"
5,"I have bought this printer for my home use. It was ideal and the print quality is also good. It has wifi enabled so you will be able to take print even without connect the printer to a pc/laptop. You can directly send prints and  scan documents using the mobile or installing the HP app.Pros:* Easy to setup* Light weight* No so bulky* Premium looks* Print, Scan, Copy and Fax functionality is available* WIFI facility is available to take print/scan using your mobile phoneCons:* Duplicate printing is not available* Only white colour is available so can get dirty easily* Couldn't find the option to change the default password of the WiFi within the printer"
5,"speed of the print & cost per page print is what the major difference for model to model.At this price range, its decent one.Best for home usage(max 100-150 prints per month).Cons:* Configuring wifi is not simple(especially while using iPhone/Mac). Company can consider giving manual for the same."
3,"HP DeskJet 4123 Multi-Function Inkjet Printer with ADFThere is absolutely no documentation with the printer. The one-page instruction takes you to a website that is not helpful. It took me a while to get it to work on Windows 10. USB connection didn't work. Can't comment on the quality of printing just yet, but looks pretty average.Do not buy if you don't know what a printer driver is, where to search for it, download and install it. Ideally, such ""home printers"" should have a plug and play installation."
1,"This is not working properly taking multisheet at a time, ink drying quickly even in black, setup is taking long time and not easy to understand,Quality of the priniting also very bad, it will trouble lot to normal printer user,Service center of hp is very pathetic not even bother about the customer..."
1,"1. Waste printer.2. Why was given an Auto feeder, useless. no proper borders always scan words print cross line.3. auto feeder manual scan both sides.bloody useless auto feeder.4. installation very difficulty, HP company not responding to conplaints.5. don't buy this printer. waste of money. plz."
5,"LikeScans and copy/prints multiple sheets up to 32 automatically.Prints from mobile through wifi.Copy sheet b/w or color, multiple copy with button press .Looks great with white and blue body.DislikeTedious driver setup on pc. Not working on win 10.Mobile hp  smart app works with wifi No direct mobile printing.Drivers Not in Cd/DVD but from web download which is confusing as Model is not found sometimes."
5,"Works as expected. I'm totally satisfied with this printer. It's pretty good for home or personal use. And fully loaded features with ease like wireless printing, scan, copy and a 35 page auto document feeder. But it wolud have been better if the catrideges could have printed a few more pages."
5,Wireless printer with app for phone and email id to print from remote location. Other ways also for remote printing. You dont need any cable to print from phone or pc. Cartridge are cheap and print quality also good. Document feeder is a plus thing for hasel free copying or scanning
5,I am a HP fan when it comes to printers for home use. This is my second ink jet for home. My previous veteran was hp deskjet f 735. It served my family for 15 years. At this price I found it most economical with true wire less features. My 8 year old independently takes print. So ‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù falls short in explaining the features.
2,the printer usage and installation was good but coming to printing the cartridges will last only for 20 color prints and 45 black the consumption of ink was more and cost of each cartridges was too high each one will cost around 2800 do not go for this oneinstead go for ink tank printer though it may cost high for buying later it will save you a lot of money for printing cost
1,"Worst product, stopped working only after 1 month of limited usage, cadrige is even more worst. Only after 2 or 3 printouts it shows as empty. New one is nearly 1000 rupees. Customer care does not get connected revolves only around ivr messages. Go for any other company. I too have one Epson which is one year old, still working flawless"
3,"The printer is good, but when printing on glossy photo paper it is very slow and takes approx 5 min to print full A4 size photo page. In normal plain paper or photo copy, when printing from PDF it is very good and fast."
3,"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues. Guess it is more environmentally friendly because you will only get a print out when its the only option"
2,"When printing, it prints good but the cartridge finishes up fast though not many print outs taken.Another issue that the printer is not connected wirelessly... It connects on Wi-Fi once, then if I switch it off and on it again, I have to reconfigure it or use cable for printing."
5,"Very satisfied with this printer, copier & scanner. Good part is it comes with ADF.Best multi function printer in this range."
4,The set up is not easy how ever once done especially the Direct WiFI once set up it becomes a good product.
5,"The product was delivered as mentioned. Packaging was good. Installation through the hp app and wifi connection was a little time consuming, however not that hard. The prints are good."
1,"Does not recognise the paper size, always paper jams in the printer. Always have to cancel the print job. DONOT BUY HP PRINTERS.The color ink got finished in just about 10-12 pages. The black in another 15 or so.Never get my job done in short time. Always half an hour for just 1 print."
4,The quality is good. I found Wifi Direct setting to be a little cumbersome. It was not able to detect 5g dual band modem for configuration but 2.5 g was fine. So if one had a dual band modem keep this in mind. Else it was easy to install.
2,It's just been a month I bought this product and have us d it just twice and now getting issues with the connection issue printing issue and sometimes gets error as ink over where in ink is also there is cartridge. Really not happy with the product in just a month.
1,No support from HP at all .. the Customer Care number provide in the site is not reachable.(1800-2000-047)
1,"NOT A VALUE FOR MONEY, TOO SLOW, EVEN AFTER FRESH CARTRIDGE FEED PRINTING TOO SLOW... DIDNT EXPECTED THIS QUALITY FROM HP....Not Happy with this chosed Printer.... Too Slow in Printing. once current job done, clicking on next job print, it doesnt start printing itself, it needs to power off, on then starts, Page stucks sometimes in between. One page B&w print take 5 - 7 minutes to print. Not happy with such quality of HP."
4,My criteria was once a page print per week or 15 days also it has xerox and wireless connectivity so m happyU need to call a technical guy for setup do book in advance wd hp its freeNot tried scanning rest all is good
4,Received the product well in time. Good product in this price range. Print quality is average. Driver is not included in this package. This is creating problem linking with PC. Otherwise it is a good deal.
5,Printer was well packed with safety. Configuration of wifi with HP smart App and Wifi-Direct is easy. i button helps in getting information or you can check YouTube videos also to setup. 805 cartridges are available tricolour and black both.
4,"It's a good Printer from HP, But consuming lot of Ink. If you are using very rarely you can prefer this printer and scanner is also Good. WiFi Tech is great and we can print from phone also through the connected router which is Good to use on the go."
1,This product is not working not working I said
5,"Purpose:I bought this scanner to digitise 1000s of 1970s, 80s pictures of our family. Most of the photos were already faded and lost colour.Progress:I have already completed scanning 2000+ photos and works like charm. Exactly what I expected.Feedback:1. Works perfectly on my Mac (despite some reviews say it doesn't). I am using latests Mac OS version on MacBook Pro. Was not hard setting it up on my Mac. Just downloaded the latest version software ""Epson Scan 2"" from the website and it worked.2. Picture Quality is much better than any other scanners I tried (& bought) before trying this one. Quality is close to what you can see in the picture, is what you will get it on your file. Other scanners, though they claim 48 bit colour, they gave colour banding issues.3. Faded colours are auto corrected if the feature is enabled during scan. (I still had to do some on Photoshop)4. Both Colour and Grayscale pictures worked perfect.5. Best part is, when you scan multiple photos, the photos are cropped into separate files and colour restoration works for each photo separately.Overall: No complaints so far. Bit expensive though."
5,The Epson V600 photo has to be the most efficient and budget-friendly scanner out there. If you are a photographer who shoots on film and wants to have more control over your negatives then go for it!I have scanned 500‚Äôs of 35mm & 120 mm film negatives and I found no flaw as of yet.PRO TIP : You can get yourself a free Silverfast scan software by just entering your product ID number. Go to the EPSON website to get more details on it.
5,"I purchased this scanner for scanning negatives and converting them into digital image files. All negatives are 25 to 30 years old. The scanner is amazing in scanning them into positives with image correction through software. One must use professional mode for correcting colour, tone etc. using curves. Lot of options are available. I will come up with detailed feedback later. The scanner is highly recommended for negatives as well as positives."
5,Good one.Very much satisfied of the output
4,Good Product.

4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it‚Äôs quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.FYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢INSIDE BOX‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. Printer2.

On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won‚Äôt even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it‚Äôs a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won‚Äôt work and give communication error.‚ñ∂ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢FINAL VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.‚ñ∂ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don‚Äôt print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.‚ñ∂ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can‚Äôt return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."

Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance üòûüò©üò©. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn‚Äôt work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
2,"Regret to buy this Printer. There is no background light in the display. Very difficult to see what is being displayed. Print quality & Copy quality is worse than the HP Inkjet printer which I have been using. Duplex printing is not working. Since I started using the printer after the expiry of the return window, I could not return the product."
3,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
5,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
1,"Worst printer, printing quality is low.Toner come along with the printer is used one. It list only for 400 pages.If you want to buy new toner, it cost around 5000 rs and it gives only 1500 pages.To costly to print.I didn't recommend this printer.Worst customer care service.Compared to this taking prints from out side is more economical."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ‚Çπ3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,"At this price you cannot get anything better. For those who are complaining about the cartridge life, please NOTE THAT THE INCLUDED CARTRIDGE IS A STARTUP CARTRIDGE WITH ONLY 20% INK. Please buy a standard cartridge and you will achieve your dream number of pages... Also its a home printer so do not expect a print speed of 1000 pages per minute. Overall very good investment. I do recommend.It was also received with all HP original Seals. So many thanks to the seller for sending an brand new piece."
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,"I had a problem with this defective product. The customer care was difficult in returns and replacement. High value products should be returned with no hassles. That is how Amazon US and UK or any other country functions. Amazon customer care was very hesitant. The product description had 20 pages per min for BW and 5 pages per min color prints, but it would take 5 mins to print a black and white page with a simple letter. I was not even able to print an amazon bill. The color print never worked. Amazon agreed to a replacement. The replacement arrived and I tried to print a simple BW document and it didn't print at all. The replacement never worked at all. Amazon took the replacement back with a lot of very difficulty after sending video evidences and multiple photos of their useless product. Never buy this model. I have a HP Inkadvantage 310 series and it works like butter, fast and easy to use. Never by printers with cost less than Rs5000 from HP. They sell outdate hardware."
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it‚Äôs not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don‚Äôt cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from üò∑ u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
3,Appario Retail Private Ltd did not respond to email. Wrong product serial number were mentioned in invoice because of that I could not get HP redemption. It is very bad that Appario Retail Private Ltd  did not respond to emails and willingly mentioned wrong product serial  number so that I could not get redemption from hp. Neither HP nor amazon have no corrective measures.
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
2,HiI am here to tell u about the printer i brought first i tell u cons there are many consCONS : 1)THERE IS NO OPTION FOR COPIES LIKE IF I KEEP 1 PAPER IN SCANNER AND I WANT 10 COPIES AT A TIME BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO PRINT 10 COPIES AT A TIME2) THE PAPER IS STRUCKING IN BETWEEN RODS WHILE PRINTING.3) LAST BUT NOT LEAST  THE INK CARTRIDGE IS SO EXPENSIVE 700 PER 1 BLACK INK CARTRIDGE AND 700 PER TRI COLOR CARTRIDGE AND WHEN WE PRINT UPTO 20 PAGES WITH BLACK OR TRI COLOUR INK WILL BE COMPLETED WITH WHAT INK U PRINTED . THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INK SHOULD BE VERY CHEAP BUT HERE INK IS VERY EXPENSIVE.4) NO WIFI AVAILABLE5)WE CANNOT CONNECT MOBILE SO MUCH TIME WITH OTH CABLEPROS :  PRINTER IS BUDGET FRIENDLY FOR HOME BUT INK IS VERY HIGH...PLEASE DONT BUY THIS......HOPE YOU READ THIS REVIEW.THANK YOU.
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
1,The printer doesn't include Cartridge. then i saw the bwlo saying customer also ordered comp pack. then i have ordered cartridge as well. finally there was no BW cartridge only color came and ordered again BW and waiting for delivery. its frustrating ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not good approach. be clear in your add and provide the right suggestion to customer.also . the printer box was delivered at the opened condition. its was not factory packaged. printer was not even covered properly insde‚Ä¶.im not at happy with this deal.
1,"It does not work. It prints pages in parts and then stops - or does not print at all. Have to press the black or colour button repeatedly to make it start. And whatever printing it does is done at a pace slower than a snail on a relaxed outing!! And printing is accompanied by disturbing noise line by line. the whole unit is tinny, like a child's toy - only gives no pleasure.I have never complained of an Amazon product. Could you please advise where do I go from here. How does one lodge a complaint? How to return the printer? (I am ordering another one from you.)Thanks and regards."
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
1,"After a lot of trial and error by me as well as by the technician from HP, finally the conclusion was drawn that this printer is not compatible with MacOS. Weirdly, this is not mentioned anywhere in Amazon detail page and HP has kept this fact hidden in some safe vaults which I failed to discover."
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
1,I received the HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2338 model today. I have tried many times to connect my printer with the laptop through usb and using HP smart app. It is not detecting my printer. I even tried to do the same with other laptop still not working. I think I need to replace this product.
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
1,"Not sure if they know what are they building.The printer model says 2338, it is not detected by the driver software on windows 10, m1 mac.Tried returning, disappointed."
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,"Very expensive print, not working with ink refill, every time I have to change cartridge that cost 1600, and it have to be changed after 200 print"
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
1,not working with epson L210 printers only original cable supporting the scanner
4,Good products
4,It is working fine. Got same product as shown.but coastly . however i am happy with this product.nice product.
5,super
5,Low price but good item
4,Thanks.....
5,"Nice product,"
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.

5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later‚úå"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,ü§£"
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"
5,Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.
4,Nice product
4,"It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %.  Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%."
2,Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online
1,Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time
3,"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over."
5,Awesome printer... Bought for only ‚Çπ1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..
1,"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges  will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp."
2,Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.
2,Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.
1,"Never buy HP printers. I did this mistake 3 times. Wasted a tonne money on cartridges and repair. The actual problem is ""HP DISABLES YOUR PRINTER remotely"" if you ever use a cartridge more than once. Especially if you refill it. They want us to buy their ridiculously expensive tiny cartridges every month! If we don't use different ones, they disable your printer. It happened to me twice while using hp inkjet printer and DeskJet printer.I bought this printer in August 2020 and it's disabled in September 2020! Due to lockdown I used a refil ink and bam!The printer was printing with the refill ink offline.As soon as I went online with printer connected to my laptop, it won't print again!!I haven't registered with HP. I thought if I don't register this won't happen. But still happened. Now I have a light blinking printer with me, which won't print.Hp is the worst."
1,"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer."
5,"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:Go to : https://www8.hp.com1.Go to support option2.Click on Softwares & drivers3.Click on printer image4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox5.Click Submit6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying."
2,"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,One cartridge prints about 30  A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printerThis has way too many problems for its costBut, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this"
3,"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant"
4,CCD Scanner Cable for HP M1005 thought it would be poor quality but when I connected printer this cable also looks original qaulity
4,Good product.working well
5,VERY GOOD QUALITY
5,Supper
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
1,"I've tried setting this printer up over Wifi and USB cable. Through my Laptop and my smartphone. No matter what you do it won't recognize or detect the printer. It is unusable.Ridiculous for a Rs. 18,999 Printer. Completely useless.Update: Just to give you an idea, to take scans on this printer, it asks you to enable your location (GPS) on your smartphone, and create an account with HP. You have to wonder why. Throughout the setup, it keeps asking for your location. After over an hour of struggle I managed to set it up on my smartphone, but no matter what I do, my laptop cannot use the HP Smart App to connect to this printer regardless of whether I use the Wifi or USB options. If I try to log into the built in web server on the printer, the password I am expected to provide is wrong. This is so ridiculous - because I am connecting to it over USB!!Don't buy this printer! if you must buy one from HP, by a different model. My 10 year old printer works effortlessly, but this is a piece of junk. I didn't have a great impression of HP, but now its hit a new low.Update: part of the problem is there are limited instructions, and some of it is incorrect. This printer says it supports 5Ghz networks but actually it supports only 2.4Ghz. If you are trying to set it up on a 5Ghz network, it will never detect, and won‚Äôt even tell you that is the reason. If setup with the HP app doesn‚Äôt work, just use your built in software. Their app isn‚Äôt needed except for mobile devices,  and I feel they mainly use it to collect data on you üòû"
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"

1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn‚Äôt work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,"I installed the printer today post delivery, realised that the WiFi receptivity is WEAK relative to my earlier printer. Luckily I have 2 WiFi connections at my place, it eventually got connected to the second WiFi Router (the routers are in the next room). The printer has reasonably good Scan and Print quality. This is my preliminary feedback. Will update after few days of working. I have by now tested every feature except FAX in this printer. The SCANs are just beautiful and quite fast. TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY .."
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
3,"Printing quality is good. Printing 2 sides of paper option not able to findScanning feature is not great. When scanning from hp Application on Laptop gives hard time. After  clicking scan button, we need to push paper little bit, how accurate we keep papers before hitting scan button it doesn‚Äôt detect, little move is mandatory after clicking scan button. And scanner is also very slow in scanning papers. Recommend 60% to others."
1,Cartage is too costly.. don't buy
1,Within a month toner low indication. Catridge not available in local market. Original catridge cost around 4.5k. Dont buy. Dont buy. Waste of money
2,"Printer cost is cheap but maintenance cost is higher than other printers. It is not for official purpose , it is used in home for kids project."
1,"Printer cost ‚Çπ17,500. Initial toner was exhausted within 50 print out. New toner is chip type for this model and cost ‚Çπ4500. It's kind of trap from HP to keep chip in Toner. B/W Print/ Xerox  cost ‚Çπ5 per page"
1,"The worst printer that I have ever bought! Right from day 1 issues, service is bad, support is bad. Very truly bad experience. Paper Jam issues, could not print even a single page. Used other printers, never had even a single issue. Don't recommend, stay away from this printer. Utter waste of money, down the drain!"
4,Scanner and all other functions work well. Wifi printing also works well.Duplex printing is not automatic ‚Ä¶ papar needs to be feed again‚Ä¶Paper tray not fully covered. This may cause harm in long run.
3,"Poor build quality. Too much paper jams. I brought it just for the ADF, that works fine. But apart from that the, paper jamming and all its irritating."
5,Not send warranty card
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."
2,HP should have given auto duplex printing in this model. People who are buying beware of it even-though ADF is mentioned in the spec. Such a basic feature is not available.
5,Product is good quality no doubt but some time I face the problem to connect with wifi.
5,Excellent
3,"It does not have automatic duplex as claimed on Amazon site. Also its all features like booklet printing, two sided printing, customised page printing cannot be availed on Mac. Air print just offers basic printing"
1,Please do not buy this printer.  Because when the toner is completely exhausted you have to buy a new one.  Toner is expensive.  This toner is fitted with a chip. New toner is not available in the market to buy
1,I bought a new one but still the printer is printing half prints and tearing the pages I also clean the cartridge several times but still is not working well I bought a month ago hardly I printed 10pages yet
1,Worst printer please don't take
1,The printer doesn't scan its cartridge and giving the same error again and again.This is the condition of a new printer. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,I did not get it my USB cable and all with printerOnly power cable i got it
1,"Product received one day early, but colour printing error showing and the carriage not compitable error coming. Another important thing, I ordered the item on 22.01.2019 and received on 26.01.2019, but warrenty showing only 4 months balance in HP official site, that means it may be an old return product. I trying to replacement but no option in Amazon. Then I contacted customer care over phone and send photos for proof of warranty. I tried to HP site for warranty dispute , but the site is not working. Totally disappointed in this purchase.So please replace the item at the earliest with a new one and stop making this type of issues to customers.ThanksAfter two I got new one piece, working satisfactory. Thanks Amazon."
1,This product is very good. But this type of ink are very poor. I m not satisfied. Photo print is very very poor and there is blow off.......
4,No WiFi as mentioned.customer services are very good.
4,"This review i am writing after 3 days of usage...I suggest printer demo is required if u r first time purchasing printers or u can call HP customer care for any help regarding printer.1)  Printer quality is Good....  I used Photo sheets 210GSM for photos... When we r printing photos we need to change which type of sheets we r using. Then colour photos clarity will be good.2) Text messages or mail printouts  A4  size black and white print is also good.3) Many people review say that warranty is for 3 or 6 months....  Its false information....  As we purchase  printers, we get GST bills....  Based on purchase date u r warranty will start.4) Some people have giving Printer head was not working....  Its manufacture defects...  We have warranty we can call customer care and solve the issue. We can't blame Amazon for everything.5) Scan print is not so good....  I rate 4 star for scan printouts.  Other printouts r very nice...I am satisfied with this printer.....  If u need Wi-Fi then go for HP 410....."
4,"This printer has a lot of mixed reviews. Everybody praised Epson and Brother. But there are many advantages to this printer which i will mention below:1. Printer Heads are detachable and can be fitted yourself. The price of each printer head is also significantly lesser than of Epson, Canon and Brother.2. Total 4 buttons - one to cancel. one to pull/re-pull pages. one to colour copy and one to do B&W copy. The copy function is very simple. It will scan and print in one touch. No need to scan separately and print separately.This makes it very simple and easy.3. HP support and availablility. This is its biggest strength. Printer installation and demo done in 1 day. Product is of last year, hence called HP support to update the warranty according to purchase, done in 2 days flat.4. For home printing needs, speed of printing is okay for me. Prints about 7-8 pages per minute. First page print takes longer, i guess the printer takes time to warm up. It becomes quicker after that.5. Paper quality also decides the quality of print. A colour print on a rough A4 sheet and a glossy photo paper is very very different. It is not fair to compare both.6. Super easy to install and operate yourself. One youtube video is enough. Everything has a slot and there is nothing that can go wrong. Even ink is spill free.Cons:As said by other reviewers here, it is not as fast as Epson or Brother.It is light weight and plastics are flimsy. So rough and careless usage may break or crack parts."
4,"I was looking for a printer which would allow me to take printouts at very affordable prices. Initially I was thinking about buying a normal inkjet printer but the main problem with them is the cost of printing per page. And the inkjet cartridges are also very expensive and get finished very soon. Then I thought of buying a laser printer because they were fast and per page printing cost was also very low but the main problem with laser printers are that they are expensive and most of them can't be used for colour printing. Then I came to know about the ink tank printers which seemed a modified version of inkjet printers. I looked up on the internet about it and most of the results showed positive reviews about these ink tank printers. Hence, I decided to buy this printer for me. Aftera a week's usage I'm penning down the pros and cons of this printer below,Pros,1. Very low printing cost per page. (10 paise for black n white and 20 paise for colour printouts).2. 4 ink bottles (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) are already provided with the printer which should last around one year if used moderately.3. Very much ink efficient compared to a normal inkjet printer. One can print upto 4000 pages of black n white printouts and 6000 pages of colour printouts with the bottles already given along with this printer.4. The printing speed is moderate if used for normal colour printing. If used in echo mode, then the printing becomes even faster ! It can print upto 20 black n white pages and 8-10 colour pages in a minute in echo mode. In normal mode the speed will slightly decrease. It takes around 2-3 minutes to print a colour saturated image or poster on a photo paper which is quite fast.5. Very easy and user friendly buttons are provided for controlling the printer for novice users.Now let's talk about it's cons,1. It's not a wireless printer. Hence you can't print from anywhere, the printer has to be connected to a PC/laptop via a USB cable. This makes it little difficult to take printouts using a mobile phone (although OTG can be used).2. No auto duplex printing. It cannot print on both sides of a paper automatically.3. The initial setup and assembly of the printer is quite complex and may be intimidating for a first time user. It's best to call an official HP support person to do the setup and installation.Last but not the least, keep the following points in mind before buying this or any other ink tank printer,1. Buy ink tank printers if and only if you're going to print very frequently. If you don't print regularly then don't buy such printers because the inks will dry up if you leave it unused for a long time. You've to print at least 3-4 times in a week to keep the ink from drying.2. Although the printing cost of such printers are very less, you've to be careful about it's initial pricing. The primary cost of such printers are much higher although it'll benefit you in the long run.3. It uses liquid ink in the ink tanks, hence do not move our disturb the printer frequently because it may cause bubble formation inside the ink tanks and that'll damage the printheads. Printheads are not cheap to replace so keep this thing in mind.That's all folks. I hope this review helps you guys to decide whether to buy this printer or not."
4,Print quality is ok.It took me 3 minutes to print A4 size photo sheet. N it is ok to take that much time.If we get that print in short time we will touch that printed area then colours on that photo will be spreaded allover on that photo.So immediately don't touch photos after getting them printed. let it dry for sometime then it is ok to touch printed area.I got this printer for 8370 in amazon great indian sale.N difference between 410 n 310 is only wifi option. In my opinion btr to by this printer itself. u r getting cable to print from mobile itself. N it is esay to Operate with our mobile. Till now didn't used their tech support. Installed this printer by seeing YouTube videos. If u don't know how to install the same then for sure take their tech support.
5,"genuine HP brand printer works best quality prints ,easy to operate and best software from HP to install in PC . value for money"
1,Did not expect such a low quality from HP. Also warranty started 5 months before I bought. Still trying to sort out warranty issue. Cartridge jam in just 20 days.
5,Hp ink tank 310 model works fine. Low noise while printing.
1,"Pls dont sell hp printers through amazon hp printer is pulling down goodwill of amazon,after sale service of hp is very very worst,no installation till now delivered on- 24/1,installation req on-25/1 today- 30/1,and also said that your warranty is only for 10 month instead of 12 months,worst worsttttt."
5,"I had been using Canon pixma MP287 for more than 5 years. But the loud clattering sound right from day 1 of purchase had been unbearable, but HP310 has been far far better in following respects.1.Most silent printing2. Faster printing & scanning.3. Beautiful printing quality.4.Contast,brightness etc of the colour printcan be adjusted as per your requirement though exact colour may not be achieved."
1,"Bought for 7649/- on 10th May. The print quality is good only on A4 size papers for document printing. When it comes to photo printing on photo paper the colors are not drying quickly. Especially black color is not sticking to the paper at all. I tried with several photo papers. The colors can be washed away even with gently finger rub even after 5 hours in this hot sun(45 c Hyderabad). Hence I don`t suggest this printer for photo printing. Better go for Epson. Otherwise the printer is user friendly and easy to install. I am disappointed with photo printing issues and quality of printing. However, for the price I paid I am not that happy."
4,Good printerBest in its segment and price range.No issue in official useOnly issue in photo printing by its light print and ink is removed by washing.All ink tank are same. No difference. I can see epson also. I give 5 star if its print is some dark col.
1,Installation problem every 48hrs once we should do install.Device supporting problem happening.It's giving only 3000pages only same cost canon Epson printers giving 7000pages.
4,"1.Print quality of HP is better than of Epson.2. Epson gives better plastic body that of HP.3. Epson gives us low maintenance cost printer.4. In Hp we get  ink tank attached to the printer but Epson doesn't.5. The way, Hp takes to cover the printer's inner portion, is great. Epson printer's inner portion get more dusty that of HP printer.6. In my eye, in business purpose hp is good for colour photo print. Epson will go for xerox or other normal print out.7. It is too hard to get a original ink in online."
5,"PRINTING QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, ONLY ONCE FOUND INK FLOW GOT DISTARBED WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT AFTER 3-4 DAYS BREAK, BUT SURPRISINGLY IT CORRECTED IT SELF ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY I GOT FINE PRINT AT SECOND ATTEMPT( MACHINE SELF DETERMINED) ITS PREVIOUS PAGE WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INK FLOW. ONE SHOULD REMEMBER INK COST IS HIGH FOR THIS PRINTER. HOPE THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN."
4,"For those who don't know how to set this up, follow these (its pretty easy)IMPORTANT STEPS (FAILING TO PERFORM THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR PRINTER)1. Remove cardboard protectors inside the printer by opening front hatch.2. After opening front hatch (not the scanner), you will see a orange bolt assembly. Slide that and bring it in the middle.3. When the bolt attached assembly is in the middle, turn the bolt right side (its okay you can use force for a bit). The bolt will pop out off the assembly, we won't need the bolt again to set up the printer (but keep it aside).4. Unpack the print heads, and push the tricolour printhead on the left, and black printhead on the right (black printhead will require some extra push to get inside). After they r secured, close the blue hatch (tip top mechanism).5. DO NOT SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY TO ITS INITIAL POSITION AGAIN, machine will do it itself. Close the black covers and that's it.6. Start filling up your ink tank. You must fill all of the ink tanks not just one. Remember you dont have to completely fill it, mind the minimum level and the ink level should be above that but not necessarily on the maximum level. As for the ink bottles, remove the white cap completely and break the seal, DO NOT DAMAGE THE BOTTLE NUZZLE JAM, it workes like a vulve.STARTING UP YOUR MACHINE1. Connect the machine to power. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE PC YET! Turn on power button, printer will start ink priming now and make some Conjuring 3 noises (its normal).2. Pull out paper loading tray from the back of the printer. Use A4 paper, slide the blue hook to left load the paper (keep the paper stack to right side. Not in the middle, not in the left, but in the right). Secure the paper pulling blue hook to the right again.3. If you see any blinking icon (any) in the control panel, push and hold resume button for 3 seconds and you're almost done.4. Printer will print 2 pages at first automatically. Open the scanner, allign any one of the pages on the glass (printed side faces the glass) in the bottom right corner. Close the scanner and press the colour copy button once. Printer will copy the page (first 2-3 printouts maybe weird no need to panic). Now your printer finished ink priming completely.5. Connect it to your PC now. Download HP smart app from Microsoft store (its completely free). And if you have already f*ked up the windows update just like me then, my friend, you have to re-install your windows.6. Once HP smart app is installed create your account and that's it use its interface to print normally, make sure you're using proper page size.You're welcome!"
1,"Now this is my Third complain1.Techzart Smart watch returned to seller without informing me..Delivery boy told he ll come next day and deliver.2.Nokia 3310,i gifted to my grandmother.One switch was not working..So faulty product..3.HP inktank 310..print head was not working..it was delivered on time but after installation it showed print head error..Again supplying faulty product.Amazon team and Amazon product becoming risky to purchase nowadays."
3,"Product is good. But no Installation service provided till now, If HP is not proving Installation then how can they provide after sale warranty.Overall product is good.Printing through Laptop/ computer is very fast ( Takes max. 10-15seconds for one color print )Printer through Mobile is very slow ( takes around 3minutes for one color print)I have installed it by myself by the help of youtube videos, otherwise its very difficult to install for a new person.Printing quality is average.Built Quality is below average.Design is compact.Ink Consumption is high, My black Ink is 50% in a tank now (with max 200 prints)Other Color inks are 70-75% remaining  ( with same max. 200 prints)"
1,"I bought this printer on 03rd May. When checked with HP website for warranty, it was showing  that already 6 months the printer warrant is finished and only 6 months warranty is left.I contacted Amazon and explained about the issues. They immediately sent an replacement. With the replacement order also the same issue.Warranty already started on 01-Dec-18 and only 6 months warranty left. Also, the serial number mentioned on the Invoice was also wrong. I struggled a lot to get it rectified. Poor and pathetic support was the gift I got it.Be careful with the purchase of this printer"
5,"The printer was recd in time on 25 jan 2019 well packed Installation was carried out on 29 jan 2019 satisfactorily. However, on 31 jan when I started the first print, the movement of paper was sluggish and incomplete and error message indicating black printhead problem was seen. Informed HP who have raised a complaint and also informed it could possible a case of DOA!.Will get in touch on ce the technician attends to it."
5,"Product is very good, easy to install and use. In a minute you can print 10 page full colour and 25 page black and white.I didn't get printer invoice and warranty card with this printer."
5,"Using from oct 2020,1) Print quality is good.2) Plastic material is sturdy though printer is very light weight.3) Printing speed is acceptable.  While purchasing I was confused between ink tank & inkjet printer as latter is low-cost, but saw & heard reviews about inkjet's high operating cost (though ink can be injected in cartridge but it seldom works & can damage printer).My concern before purchasing was what if printer is left unused for long duration & to my surprise it works quiet well as I didn't use it for 1-2 months on 2 occasions (this is not the case with inkjet printers, you'll have to replace cartridge).  Installation & operation is also easy.  Though upfront cost is higher but economical in long term.Overall excellent for students & useful for small office."
1,Hi Team. I bought this product on 30 sep 2019 and I have problems with printer cartridge and while I check the warranty it says already expired during may only. But when I purchased it was having 1 year warranty. This not being supported by HP nor Amazon. I am unable reach Amazon customer care... this is really worst service and wrong committment.  I am a regular customer of Amazon and this kind of cheating was  never expected. Now I have to get this repaired myself. So any of you whole buying HP products on Amazon please check the warranty properly
1,don't purchase anything from HP because i think this is Chinese company now so they don't you provide after sale service after all i purchased this printer in June month printer works for 2-3 months in good condition but after that printer started to give very slow printing after tracing one month to my complaint to HP they closed the complaint with saying printer is working fine even i proved that printing is slow before their engineer and their excutive tasted on their same own printer in their service center and admitted that problem. karlo bagh delhi service center is pathetic. printing speed will become below half which company claim after some heavy usage so dont buy this model and even i suggest dont buy any model from hp service is pathetic
1,I purchased this hp printer due to my experience with hp but this time hp and amazon both disappointed me. HP don't bother about installation of online purchased items. After many efforts I was able to book request for installation. Person assigned installation didn't call me and reported that I didn't pick phone. Some other official blamed me outrightly for this without confirming the facts. Instead of evolving a system to overcome deficiencies hp is supporting it's erring officials. Thinking to return as now I think hp will not support is any issue of warranty arises.
1,"I recommend everyone who purchases this, should first check invoices,p-slip,order summary etc. Otherwise you would be fooled/cheated.I'd purchased this printer on 29thSep2019 upon checking I found that Manufacture Warranty End Date is 14Nov2019(so damn sure it's old product, not even 2 months). I thought, as it's working fine later I could raise dispute with HP I could extend the warranty period providing invoices etc.Now comes the agony when checked, serial number is p-slip is invalid and doesn't match with that of the device(They've noted it as 'New Serial Number' in p-slip). Due to this you can't have warranty service from HP. Now if you go back to amazon support reporting this issue, they keep us waiting endlessly without a resolution and your 1yr purchase period gets over and warranty period is expired.So if you have to service the printer, you cannot have it under warranty. And thus my printer is unusable since 1 month."
3,"Delivery was prompt. Packaging was good.Installation was smooth. I installed it on Mac. Generally use wired rather than wifi. So convenient for me.I noticed that the ink does dry up after some time if not used. It also affects the printout quality.Scanning is very bad. Because the lid is very light, for scanning, it cannot press the paper by itself appropriately. You need to press the lid explicitly to have good scan quality. It is over and above the psi mentioned while scanning."
5,"Used For several days and wrote review.Pros:1.Easy to Install2. As u know its ink tank so no stress for ink usage.3. Fast with scan and copy4. Fast with PC.5. Best in this price range.(Don't overexpect).6. Hassle Free Ink Filling.(Easy, with valves to avoid spilling).7. All in one Print, scan ,copyCons:1. Very slow with Mobile phone OTG using HP print service app(official).Overall best printer at its price range must go for it."
4,"After making all searches for almost two months during this lockdown, finally come to conclusion, to purchase the printer which is available and affordable with cost of printer and cost per page of printing (b&w & color). Was confused to either go for HP or Epson. First wanted to go for only printer and not all in one, but for few thousand rupees, feels better to have AIO option incase future needs arise.Pros:1. Easy to install (after seeing some youtube videos), inserting ink in tank is super easy, no waste of ink, hands clean.2. Print quality was good.Cons:1. I tried to use OTG cable with mobile to take print but cannot print with HP Smart app, as the printer is not at all detectable in HP Smart app. Spoken to hp service, they also said this print is not supportive to OTG-Mobile use. But after searching few more option such Printershare which is paid version but finally tried nokoprint  and it solved the issue with nokoprint. So only regret that HP original software cannot give printing solution via mobile. Request them to work on it.I will make further review after few months."
4,As usual Hp blacktext prints are crisper than epson  and are better. The black ink does not wash off with rain water (tested on rain water ) .as a office printer  does everything . I do miss the wireless function at 7400 i am happy with the purchase . printed a whole page photo print on  5 rs desmat photo paper . print does not scrap away as reviewed by others. Photo print is not as best as epson but i can say its 90 % of epson photo print .  1 issue i had that the warranty showed to be 4 months  left only  which nearly gave me a heart attack . i have my friends at Iqor which are the service providers of Hp laptops & printers and they assured me the warranty  starts with the  gst bill . ( On the safe side i asked for an installation and the warranty date got rectified .)
1,"This printer has given me nothing but headaches! Just after 3 months of use and less than 50 print outs, both cartridge got damaged. Since it was on warranty, they serviced it free of cost. Exactly one year after purchase, the paper feeding mechanism has become faulty. Also, the print of low quality and very slow. I think they have supplied me a defective piece when I got it in Diwali offer (Rs 7999)."
5,"If you are looking for some printer which has high quality prints, and operation cost is low, ink tank printers are the choice you should consider. Also, Ink tanks printer don't dry up even when not used for sometime. The filling of ink is also something which is spill proof. So overall and a very good purchase."
5,I knew well that HP was a good company and it proved again!! Superb print quality. Only disadvantage is that it has no adjust feature to control black and colour print. Xeroxes are  good. Any colour they give. Superb model.... Easy to install. I printed over 100 pages in 3 days and only 2ml of black was used. Ink quality very good. Worth of its price!Stay Home And Stay Safe. Buy HP without any thought! üôèüôèüòÉ
4,"Nice printer, giving one star less as it's only 1 week of using"
3,Worst HP support.... No one will come for installation or for tech assist. Print quality is better. But while printing from web page of from email the font is too low and just get printer in a corner of a a4 and no way you can change the font size. That menu option will not be available while printing from web. But printing from MS word is OK. No tech can fix this even assisted almost 10 Times with remote support. But they won send a tech to home also.... On site warranty is just fake.
4,Going through some reviews it was a bit disappointing at first but after some research I found it satisfied enough to go ahead and order it. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to install it. All you need to do is Dowload 100 + mb printer software and you're done. Took 40-45 minutes to complete the process. Only hope that it's economical in the long run. (fingers crossed)
5,We bought this printer 15 days back. It's a good one. Ita got scanner n printing option. we tried printing on a photo paper the print was good but it leaves a black soot kind of thing after sometime on the surface. Not sure it's the same with other brand.  Other than tat its good.We installed the printer on own.The person who was assigned to instal dint help us in anyway. While unboxing he kept on saying without a CD I won't touch it even after informing tat it's not needed and also not included in the box n he left. Other representative was helpful on the phone n helped us.The printer is good.
3,"A good product - - poor service.Printer is good, build quality is well enough. But please ensure not to load too many sheets in the tray, else they might get jammed.Service wise, Amazon is too bad in terms od service. The seller shipped the product with incorrect serial number, today I'm trying third time to get this one fixed with Amazon support. All they do is just send a so called note to the seller and ask me to wait and check my mail some time later.Support by HP is also not as expected. Don't try their whatsapp support, it literally sucks. My printer got jammed, I read online help, and fixed it all by my own. They reverted via whatsapp after 3 days."
4,Very useful if you want to check OMR sheet. Use only for commercial purpose like schools and cyber cafe.
1,"Not compatible with Mac, does not have any software or driver for mac machines. Totally useless for me."
5,Great product. Very easy to install and use.. Delivered 3 days in advance. Great support from seller.Thank you Nisarga Information TechnologyThank you Murali(The person who I contacted)
5,Superb...
5,Useful and a great product
3,Not a quality good also no option bellow 100 dpi many thing missing also slow scanning.... Not recommended thanks
5,Awesome
1,I want to bevgiven 0 rating not usefull in commercial purposes. Third class scan system. Not smart control system in there.No implementation in scanner
3,"After using the printer for a few days, here is what I experienced:Pros:1. Unboxing and Setup was easy and quick2. Printing was fairly simple3. Black print is fast and crispCons:1. Downloading the driver was a terrible experience. The HP Website was so slow, I could finished my lunch, evening snacks and it was still downloading!2. Colour print is absolutely worst. Highly pixlated and no sharpness even after selecting best quality in the settings.3. Printed a picture of my nephew on a photo paper and after 24 hours, it hadn't dried and got smudged when touched and spoilt the whole print.Conclusion: if you are looking for home printing and if 90% of it is B&W, its an excellent printer. Its good if you wish to print color text too. However, one of the worst printer for color photo printing. I wish I had purchased Epson Ink Tank printer!"
2,Doesn't support wifi connectivity wrong details in comparison section. Only usb connectivity.
4,I am giving 4 star due to HP support staff. I bought one printer with Amazon. Item deliver on time but product is defected. I replace the item receivd another printer. Now working properly. But HP support staff said that it was PC software problem for colour defect. Not proper support from them. But Amazon deliver on time. Thank you so much
1,I am an expert in ITand this product is just garbage. When I calibrate the print heads it does not take place and prints are all distorted and of poor quality. Tried to get a replacement the same day but amazon is not letting me do so. Everytime it takes me to consult an expert and the support person repeatedly asks the same questions again and again and finally they ask to contact HP. Total waste of my money. Just a landfill now.
4,"The printer is okay till now. It came with two sealed HP cartidges- black and tricolour; four bottles of sealed HP inks, one power cord, one USB cable and a polythene cover.USB cable is smaller than the earlier versions like GT 5800 series ( smaller the USB cable, faster the connection). Installlation of cartidges is some tricky. You have to carefully remove the orange clamps by rotating the lever in arrow direction.There is no installation CD. You have to download it from HP site.In the first day, printing may not be good. It will take time for ink system to fill the cartidges.Earlier I used GT 5810, it is same to same except some minor variation.Overall the printer is good for photo print xerox, scan etc."
1,Print head error after 30 prints and 2 weeks. 3 visits to HP service center and now they want me to buy print heads as the print head which came with printer is out of warranty. Printer is under warranty.
1,"This product made in China you can expect worst quality by default,black and white print is okay. Color print is very bad. Scanning is normal. Good bye HP I am not buying your printers,scanners any more."
5,Delivered and got installed by HP team in one day.It's looking good and all functionals are decent.Even print quality is commandable.One concern I read was on the size constraints but I felt it's pretty ok.It's only occupying quarter of my study tableOverall good buy as I bought with discount for 9.9 k.
4,This product HP 315 Ink Tank Printer is a decent printer for home use. Color Scanning and Printing takes 4-5 minutes for a single print sent from a Laptop via HP Smart Desktop App. Direct Scan and Print takes 1-2 minutes. Print quality is good for the price of Rs.9400. Ensure that you have done proper printer settings for good quality print. Not recommended for Business use as it is slightly slow (almost all non-laser printers are slow only). The received product was already registered for warranty a month before I received this product. I hope the 'Appario Retail' seller has not scammed me as to who else could have registered the product a month before the customer. There is no Wifi on this model which may be a concern for some. But you can always convert such USB-based printers to wifi printers using TP-Link routers.  Overall I would rate this product as the perfect printer for home use.
1,"Print Quality is pathetic, used superior quality paper. 40% of print outs either getting stuck inside printer or torned."
4,"Print quality is very good, printer installation is very easy, but software installation takes time.Printer is latest but the drivers needed for scanner function is a later version. Few extra steps needed for full functions. Other wise very easy."
4,Print quality is not the best but good for home use. Printing speed is little slow. Installation is easy.
5,"Print quality is as expected, nice u may say, its a large Pinter, consumes space.HP Services though slow was nice.Thanks to service engineer who came to install the printer, as he replaced the faulty colour print head supplied with the Printer."
5,Print quality is good. It easy to install and repack. To some extent value for money.
4,"The prints are OK for both color and BW. They are not awesome but decent. It's a line printer, each print will take around 10-15 secs."
5,"No doubt, printer is good and prints good. The packaging was also great and satisfied with it, but there was no Amazon sticker in/on the product.And the most important thing there was no Invoice/Bill, which is always present for any small-to-small product.Satisfied by printer and highly recommends it."
3,"Color prints are not of best quality, can't produce orginal vibrant colors, always very dark, otherwise works fine."
5,"Printer is very good and fast, very economical to use. Can print from mobile also with otg cable. Print from mobile is slow but from pc very fast. Easy to use and scanning and copy also good."
5,"I love all the features of this. If you are looking for a nice printer for home use, it is good to go."
5,Printer is really good with nice options in the HP Smart App.
1,Yet to get installation support. BUY ONLY IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ENGINEER HANDY FOR INSTALLATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE REMOTE. GOOD FOR TECHNICAL CUSTOMERS.
5,Since I started working from home and my child also online school printer became essential for us. This printer is very easy to install and use. Also this gives good quality of print. It also used for scan and copy. So overall nice performance and worth putting money on it.
5,I struggled a bit during installation of the printer...
5,Nice printer. Easy to install and take printouts.
1,No proper customer service from the manufacturer hp from the product received date of Sept 11 2021 to till today.
4,THIS PRINTER IS AWESOME BUT HAVE ONE PROBLEM OF SMUDGE THE INK ON GLOSSY PAPER
1,Good printer but Amazon not provided Rs.1500/- discount inspite filing complaint????
4,Value for money
5,Printing speed is low
1,Unable to print
3,Print is very slow other wise all are average.
1,Touch problem
1,"The scanner was delivered to me on 14th June 2020 after paying more than Rs.24,000/-. Today on the 26th July 2020 scanner was required for some urgent work, therefore I tried installing and using it, but in spite of many efforts, I failed to install the scanner.I called the CANON helpline, they asked for some number from the machine which I conveyed to them here comes the shock, I was told by the person on the other side that product which was delivered to me about 12 days is already out of warranty.So is canon cheating us in connivance with Amazon?buyers please, be-aware of fraud which may be happening on Amazon. Better be safe than sorry."
4,"I think DR-C225II  is better than the DR-C225 scanner. It can support longer sheets. The speed of the scanneris very good. The eCopy PDF Pro License key was provided, and only the driver CD. It took a day to figure out fromwhich link on the Canon site one needs to download the ecopy Pro software and the CardIRIRS software. Canon does apoor job on their web site w.r.t support. Calling Canon India support, responded immediately, but they had never heard the name of this software or how to install it. Finally the Canon link was located / provided by the seller.  Thesoftware works great.  Conversion to editable PDF, and exporting PDF files to word for editing are also great.One can scan BW, or colour. It scan both sides. Speed is great. Good for archiving all  old important documents, thatone can now discard after scanning (years of documents for tax purposes , etc !) .  While it is for A4 size, it can scanlonger documents. Only the width is constrained. If you setup the FOLIO option, and fold the wider document, thescanner will stitch the front and the back into a single page. Amazing. (you need to fold is right and make sure the paper does not skew one way. .Installation was fine on Windows 10 Pro x64 bit. I had read of numerous issues faced by others, however it was so straightforward that it installed in now time with no fuss.  It took a while to understand the scanner and thecapture software. Overall I think its a great scanner, and easy to operate."
5,This is the best scanner used by me so far. Speed is good. Scanned 600 pages in 1 hr approx. Comes with CD of drivers. Operating software is easy to use. Provided to me with invoice but when I called canon india they said out of warranty. On telling date of purchase they said ok show invoice when required. Comes with a licence key of eCopy Pro Pdf 6 free but can't find the link to download software. But performance of scanner is overall 10 pointer. I wish if some one could tell me from where to download Ecopy pdf pro office 6.
5,Total Value For Money and wonderful easy to use features
1,"Scanner is good, but its warranty is already expired when i contacted canon, is my scanner is used?? Please dont buy from scanner india seller.... Already two comments on the priduct having expired warranty ,same happened with me..."
1,"Don't even think of buying this product such a deffective 1,always, paper got stuck,for each and every month i need to replace its bush of coast 2800 in waranty period also,i comment this and report this to amazon but no use,plz don't buy it such a irresponsible supplier also"
5,Excellent product
4,"Good product,Time saver,Automatically scan both sides.Scan upto 30 pages per minute"
5,Good product from Canon japan
5,"I bought after seeing reviews on Youtube. Its Easy to use, quick, Good Picture Quality, easy to Install. Scans 30 pages ( front 30+ back 30) in a minute"
5,"High speed, duplex scanner. However, it scans only loose documents, not suitable for bound documents or books."
4,One month is going to completeWorking wellCompletely Satisfy
5,The scanner provides clear and fast scanning solution and has been very efficient.
5,Product is good working excellent
4,Awesome Delievery by Amazon on the very next day. Product satisfaction very good.
5,"Easy to use, but would have better if it were wifi enabled"
5,Excellent
5,Good product
5,Gud
5,"The best, compact, user friendly and fast scanner. Overcall best performance. Available at reasonable price. Quick service and response at installation. Overall awesome.After one month usage working fantastic and giving superb output duplex in high speed. If you want to use commercially then go for wifi option scanner same model."
1,Don't ever buy this scanner. It's not compatible with win 10. It is a old model. It's since one month the problem is not fixed.
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,Easy to use and printing well. Since this is an inkjet printer and I know I'll be sulking down sooner for the cartridge/ink.But at the end it was my deliberate decision as my printing need is only 5-10 pages a week.So I am not much worried on that side...as I have researched that ink tables are are useful only when the printing requirement is between 300-500 pages a months. So for my usage this one is suitable. And I am happy with the purchase.I have not printed on glossy paper yet to check the photo quality but colour printing on the A4 is also pretty good so far
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
3,I dont even know what is the meaning of ink advantage in here.yeah it gets the job done.But beware if using HP software to print cause the software has developed in the manner to quickly end your ink.All the maintenance (print clean and print allignment)program uses a lots of ink.Go for hp 2331 and save money.So i bought thinking ink advantage but its just not worth trusting.
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
1,"Waste of money.I had used HP inkjet printer for 5 years, and bought this as replacement. But was in for a shock!Setting up the printer was extremely difficult.I tried exchange for a different HP printer. But that is not supportedNow, in less than an year, the black cartridge has completely dried. The colour one is still working.This experience is going to lead me away from all HP products."
3,Colour print show ios 150 page print but i not print 100 page of colour print and cartage colur alert and print not completely colour gradingOnly black cartage is value for money  to usedEvery time 850‚Çπ colour cartage is very costly so buy ink tank printer
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
3,It's print quality is good. It's very easy to use. But the problem is it's colour cartridge is running out of ink too fast. We only took a few colour prints for testing it's quality and functions. But the ink level is already below the halfway mark. And I don't think it will be able to deliver the number of copies in colour as mentioned by the manufacturer. Same is the case of black ink. Though it's level is slightly better than colour ink. Still I feel it will also deliver less number of copies as mentioned by the manufacturer.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
1,If only i could give it a negative rating. I bought it as its cheaper and seemed apt for minimal use at home. The cartridge stopped working after first use itself and now I am only able to print Black and White. I have to remove the color cartridge every time before operating otherwise print wont work. Don't buy this!
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
4,"Its good in terms of quality and value for money.I printed around 300 A4 in black and white and maybe 50 in color before ink was finished.While color ink was finished even though you expect it to print in B&W - it was printing in some yellowish color, I had to remove color cartridge to print proper B&W - HP should fix this."
4,Its a very good printer. Good quality print. However 1 drawback is the installation guide is very poor and I had to rely on google to get it installed and configure. Let us see how long it will work
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
5,Needs patience to scan photos. Quality of scanned photos is not bad. Be prepared to replace batteries after scanning 70 photos.
5,Beauty of a product
4,It's good compact scanner....easy to install. On the first day itself scanned around 500 back to bakc pages...settings are also easy to manage and change. Scan quality is also good.
3,Good
1,"Product received one day early, but colour printing error showing and the carriage not compitable error coming. Another important thing, I ordered the item on 22.01.2019 and received on 26.01.2019, but warrenty showing only 4 months balance in HP official site, that means it may be an old return product. I trying to replacement but no option in Amazon. Then I contacted customer care over phone and send photos for proof of warranty. I tried to HP site for warranty dispute , but the site is not working. Totally disappointed in this purchase.So please replace the item at the earliest with a new one and stop making this type of issues to customers.ThanksAfter two I got new one piece, working satisfactory. Thanks Amazon."
1,This product is very good. But this type of ink are very poor. I m not satisfied. Photo print is very very poor and there is blow off.......
4,No WiFi as mentioned.customer services are very good.
4,"This review i am writing after 3 days of usage...I suggest printer demo is required if u r first time purchasing printers or u can call HP customer care for any help regarding printer.1)  Printer quality is Good....  I used Photo sheets 210GSM for photos... When we r printing photos we need to change which type of sheets we r using. Then colour photos clarity will be good.2) Text messages or mail printouts  A4  size black and white print is also good.3) Many people review say that warranty is for 3 or 6 months....  Its false information....  As we purchase  printers, we get GST bills....  Based on purchase date u r warranty will start.4) Some people have giving Printer head was not working....  Its manufacture defects...  We have warranty we can call customer care and solve the issue. We can't blame Amazon for everything.5) Scan print is not so good....  I rate 4 star for scan printouts.  Other printouts r very nice...I am satisfied with this printer.....  If u need Wi-Fi then go for HP 410....."
4,"This printer has a lot of mixed reviews. Everybody praised Epson and Brother. But there are many advantages to this printer which i will mention below:1. Printer Heads are detachable and can be fitted yourself. The price of each printer head is also significantly lesser than of Epson, Canon and Brother.2. Total 4 buttons - one to cancel. one to pull/re-pull pages. one to colour copy and one to do B&W copy. The copy function is very simple. It will scan and print in one touch. No need to scan separately and print separately.This makes it very simple and easy.3. HP support and availablility. This is its biggest strength. Printer installation and demo done in 1 day. Product is of last year, hence called HP support to update the warranty according to purchase, done in 2 days flat.4. For home printing needs, speed of printing is okay for me. Prints about 7-8 pages per minute. First page print takes longer, i guess the printer takes time to warm up. It becomes quicker after that.5. Paper quality also decides the quality of print. A colour print on a rough A4 sheet and a glossy photo paper is very very different. It is not fair to compare both.6. Super easy to install and operate yourself. One youtube video is enough. Everything has a slot and there is nothing that can go wrong. Even ink is spill free.Cons:As said by other reviewers here, it is not as fast as Epson or Brother.It is light weight and plastics are flimsy. So rough and careless usage may break or crack parts."
4,"I was looking for a printer which would allow me to take printouts at very affordable prices. Initially I was thinking about buying a normal inkjet printer but the main problem with them is the cost of printing per page. And the inkjet cartridges are also very expensive and get finished very soon. Then I thought of buying a laser printer because they were fast and per page printing cost was also very low but the main problem with laser printers are that they are expensive and most of them can't be used for colour printing. Then I came to know about the ink tank printers which seemed a modified version of inkjet printers. I looked up on the internet about it and most of the results showed positive reviews about these ink tank printers. Hence, I decided to buy this printer for me. Aftera a week's usage I'm penning down the pros and cons of this printer below,Pros,1. Very low printing cost per page. (10 paise for black n white and 20 paise for colour printouts).2. 4 ink bottles (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) are already provided with the printer which should last around one year if used moderately.3. Very much ink efficient compared to a normal inkjet printer. One can print upto 4000 pages of black n white printouts and 6000 pages of colour printouts with the bottles already given along with this printer.4. The printing speed is moderate if used for normal colour printing. If used in echo mode, then the printing becomes even faster ! It can print upto 20 black n white pages and 8-10 colour pages in a minute in echo mode. In normal mode the speed will slightly decrease. It takes around 2-3 minutes to print a colour saturated image or poster on a photo paper which is quite fast.5. Very easy and user friendly buttons are provided for controlling the printer for novice users.Now let's talk about it's cons,1. It's not a wireless printer. Hence you can't print from anywhere, the printer has to be connected to a PC/laptop via a USB cable. This makes it little difficult to take printouts using a mobile phone (although OTG can be used).2. No auto duplex printing. It cannot print on both sides of a paper automatically.3. The initial setup and assembly of the printer is quite complex and may be intimidating for a first time user. It's best to call an official HP support person to do the setup and installation.Last but not the least, keep the following points in mind before buying this or any other ink tank printer,1. Buy ink tank printers if and only if you're going to print very frequently. If you don't print regularly then don't buy such printers because the inks will dry up if you leave it unused for a long time. You've to print at least 3-4 times in a week to keep the ink from drying.2. Although the printing cost of such printers are very less, you've to be careful about it's initial pricing. The primary cost of such printers are much higher although it'll benefit you in the long run.3. It uses liquid ink in the ink tanks, hence do not move our disturb the printer frequently because it may cause bubble formation inside the ink tanks and that'll damage the printheads. Printheads are not cheap to replace so keep this thing in mind.That's all folks. I hope this review helps you guys to decide whether to buy this printer or not."
4,Print quality is ok.It took me 3 minutes to print A4 size photo sheet. N it is ok to take that much time.If we get that print in short time we will touch that printed area then colours on that photo will be spreaded allover on that photo.So immediately don't touch photos after getting them printed. let it dry for sometime then it is ok to touch printed area.I got this printer for 8370 in amazon great indian sale.N difference between 410 n 310 is only wifi option. In my opinion btr to by this printer itself. u r getting cable to print from mobile itself. N it is esay to Operate with our mobile. Till now didn't used their tech support. Installed this printer by seeing YouTube videos. If u don't know how to install the same then for sure take their tech support.
5,"genuine HP brand printer works best quality prints ,easy to operate and best software from HP to install in PC . value for money"
1,Did not expect such a low quality from HP. Also warranty started 5 months before I bought. Still trying to sort out warranty issue. Cartridge jam in just 20 days.
5,Hp ink tank 310 model works fine. Low noise while printing.
1,"Pls dont sell hp printers through amazon hp printer is pulling down goodwill of amazon,after sale service of hp is very very worst,no installation till now delivered on- 24/1,installation req on-25/1 today- 30/1,and also said that your warranty is only for 10 month instead of 12 months,worst worsttttt."
5,"I had been using Canon pixma MP287 for more than 5 years. But the loud clattering sound right from day 1 of purchase had been unbearable, but HP310 has been far far better in following respects.1.Most silent printing2. Faster printing & scanning.3. Beautiful printing quality.4.Contast,brightness etc of the colour printcan be adjusted as per your requirement though exact colour may not be achieved."
1,"Bought for 7649/- on 10th May. The print quality is good only on A4 size papers for document printing. When it comes to photo printing on photo paper the colors are not drying quickly. Especially black color is not sticking to the paper at all. I tried with several photo papers. The colors can be washed away even with gently finger rub even after 5 hours in this hot sun(45 c Hyderabad). Hence I don`t suggest this printer for photo printing. Better go for Epson. Otherwise the printer is user friendly and easy to install. I am disappointed with photo printing issues and quality of printing. However, for the price I paid I am not that happy."
4,Good printerBest in its segment and price range.No issue in official useOnly issue in photo printing by its light print and ink is removed by washing.All ink tank are same. No difference. I can see epson also. I give 5 star if its print is some dark col.
1,Installation problem every 48hrs once we should do install.Device supporting problem happening.It's giving only 3000pages only same cost canon Epson printers giving 7000pages.
4,"1.Print quality of HP is better than of Epson.2. Epson gives better plastic body that of HP.3. Epson gives us low maintenance cost printer.4. In Hp we get  ink tank attached to the printer but Epson doesn't.5. The way, Hp takes to cover the printer's inner portion, is great. Epson printer's inner portion get more dusty that of HP printer.6. In my eye, in business purpose hp is good for colour photo print. Epson will go for xerox or other normal print out.7. It is too hard to get a original ink in online."
5,"PRINTING QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, ONLY ONCE FOUND INK FLOW GOT DISTARBED WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT AFTER 3-4 DAYS BREAK, BUT SURPRISINGLY IT CORRECTED IT SELF ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY I GOT FINE PRINT AT SECOND ATTEMPT( MACHINE SELF DETERMINED) ITS PREVIOUS PAGE WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INK FLOW. ONE SHOULD REMEMBER INK COST IS HIGH FOR THIS PRINTER. HOPE THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN."
4,"For those who don't know how to set this up, follow these (its pretty easy)IMPORTANT STEPS (FAILING TO PERFORM THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR PRINTER)1. Remove cardboard protectors inside the printer by opening front hatch.2. After opening front hatch (not the scanner), you will see a orange bolt assembly. Slide that and bring it in the middle.3. When the bolt attached assembly is in the middle, turn the bolt right side (its okay you can use force for a bit). The bolt will pop out off the assembly, we won't need the bolt again to set up the printer (but keep it aside).4. Unpack the print heads, and push the tricolour printhead on the left, and black printhead on the right (black printhead will require some extra push to get inside). After they r secured, close the blue hatch (tip top mechanism).5. DO NOT SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY TO ITS INITIAL POSITION AGAIN, machine will do it itself. Close the black covers and that's it.6. Start filling up your ink tank. You must fill all of the ink tanks not just one. Remember you dont have to completely fill it, mind the minimum level and the ink level should be above that but not necessarily on the maximum level. As for the ink bottles, remove the white cap completely and break the seal, DO NOT DAMAGE THE BOTTLE NUZZLE JAM, it workes like a vulve.STARTING UP YOUR MACHINE1. Connect the machine to power. DO NOT CONNECT IT TO THE PC YET! Turn on power button, printer will start ink priming now and make some Conjuring 3 noises (its normal).2. Pull out paper loading tray from the back of the printer. Use A4 paper, slide the blue hook to left load the paper (keep the paper stack to right side. Not in the middle, not in the left, but in the right). Secure the paper pulling blue hook to the right again.3. If you see any blinking icon (any) in the control panel, push and hold resume button for 3 seconds and you're almost done.4. Printer will print 2 pages at first automatically. Open the scanner, allign any one of the pages on the glass (printed side faces the glass) in the bottom right corner. Close the scanner and press the colour copy button once. Printer will copy the page (first 2-3 printouts maybe weird no need to panic). Now your printer finished ink priming completely.5. Connect it to your PC now. Download HP smart app from Microsoft store (its completely free). And if you have already f*ked up the windows update just like me then, my friend, you have to re-install your windows.6. Once HP smart app is installed create your account and that's it use its interface to print normally, make sure you're using proper page size.You're welcome!"
1,"Now this is my Third complain1.Techzart Smart watch returned to seller without informing me..Delivery boy told he ll come next day and deliver.2.Nokia 3310,i gifted to my grandmother.One switch was not working..So faulty product..3.HP inktank 310..print head was not working..it was delivered on time but after installation it showed print head error..Again supplying faulty product.Amazon team and Amazon product becoming risky to purchase nowadays."
3,"Product is good. But no Installation service provided till now, If HP is not proving Installation then how can they provide after sale warranty.Overall product is good.Printing through Laptop/ computer is very fast ( Takes max. 10-15seconds for one color print )Printer through Mobile is very slow ( takes around 3minutes for one color print)I have installed it by myself by the help of youtube videos, otherwise its very difficult to install for a new person.Printing quality is average.Built Quality is below average.Design is compact.Ink Consumption is high, My black Ink is 50% in a tank now (with max 200 prints)Other Color inks are 70-75% remaining  ( with same max. 200 prints)"
1,"I bought this printer on 03rd May. When checked with HP website for warranty, it was showing  that already 6 months the printer warrant is finished and only 6 months warranty is left.I contacted Amazon and explained about the issues. They immediately sent an replacement. With the replacement order also the same issue.Warranty already started on 01-Dec-18 and only 6 months warranty left. Also, the serial number mentioned on the Invoice was also wrong. I struggled a lot to get it rectified. Poor and pathetic support was the gift I got it.Be careful with the purchase of this printer"
5,"The printer was recd in time on 25 jan 2019 well packed Installation was carried out on 29 jan 2019 satisfactorily. However, on 31 jan when I started the first print, the movement of paper was sluggish and incomplete and error message indicating black printhead problem was seen. Informed HP who have raised a complaint and also informed it could possible a case of DOA!.Will get in touch on ce the technician attends to it."
5,"Product is very good, easy to install and use. In a minute you can print 10 page full colour and 25 page black and white.I didn't get printer invoice and warranty card with this printer."
5,"Using from oct 2020,1) Print quality is good.2) Plastic material is sturdy though printer is very light weight.3) Printing speed is acceptable.  While purchasing I was confused between ink tank & inkjet printer as latter is low-cost, but saw & heard reviews about inkjet's high operating cost (though ink can be injected in cartridge but it seldom works & can damage printer).My concern before purchasing was what if printer is left unused for long duration & to my surprise it works quiet well as I didn't use it for 1-2 months on 2 occasions (this is not the case with inkjet printers, you'll have to replace cartridge).  Installation & operation is also easy.  Though upfront cost is higher but economical in long term.Overall excellent for students & useful for small office."
1,Hi Team. I bought this product on 30 sep 2019 and I have problems with printer cartridge and while I check the warranty it says already expired during may only. But when I purchased it was having 1 year warranty. This not being supported by HP nor Amazon. I am unable reach Amazon customer care... this is really worst service and wrong committment.  I am a regular customer of Amazon and this kind of cheating was  never expected. Now I have to get this repaired myself. So any of you whole buying HP products on Amazon please check the warranty properly
1,don't purchase anything from HP because i think this is Chinese company now so they don't you provide after sale service after all i purchased this printer in June month printer works for 2-3 months in good condition but after that printer started to give very slow printing after tracing one month to my complaint to HP they closed the complaint with saying printer is working fine even i proved that printing is slow before their engineer and their excutive tasted on their same own printer in their service center and admitted that problem. karlo bagh delhi service center is pathetic. printing speed will become below half which company claim after some heavy usage so dont buy this model and even i suggest dont buy any model from hp service is pathetic
1,I purchased this hp printer due to my experience with hp but this time hp and amazon both disappointed me. HP don't bother about installation of online purchased items. After many efforts I was able to book request for installation. Person assigned installation didn't call me and reported that I didn't pick phone. Some other official blamed me outrightly for this without confirming the facts. Instead of evolving a system to overcome deficiencies hp is supporting it's erring officials. Thinking to return as now I think hp will not support is any issue of warranty arises.
1,"I recommend everyone who purchases this, should first check invoices,p-slip,order summary etc. Otherwise you would be fooled/cheated.I'd purchased this printer on 29thSep2019 upon checking I found that Manufacture Warranty End Date is 14Nov2019(so damn sure it's old product, not even 2 months). I thought, as it's working fine later I could raise dispute with HP I could extend the warranty period providing invoices etc.Now comes the agony when checked, serial number is p-slip is invalid and doesn't match with that of the device(They've noted it as 'New Serial Number' in p-slip). Due to this you can't have warranty service from HP. Now if you go back to amazon support reporting this issue, they keep us waiting endlessly without a resolution and your 1yr purchase period gets over and warranty period is expired.So if you have to service the printer, you cannot have it under warranty. And thus my printer is unusable since 1 month."
3,"Delivery was prompt. Packaging was good.Installation was smooth. I installed it on Mac. Generally use wired rather than wifi. So convenient for me.I noticed that the ink does dry up after some time if not used. It also affects the printout quality.Scanning is very bad. Because the lid is very light, for scanning, it cannot press the paper by itself appropriately. You need to press the lid explicitly to have good scan quality. It is over and above the psi mentioned while scanning."
5,"Used For several days and wrote review.Pros:1.Easy to Install2. As u know its ink tank so no stress for ink usage.3. Fast with scan and copy4. Fast with PC.5. Best in this price range.(Don't overexpect).6. Hassle Free Ink Filling.(Easy, with valves to avoid spilling).7. All in one Print, scan ,copyCons:1. Very slow with Mobile phone OTG using HP print service app(official).Overall best printer at its price range must go for it."
4,"After making all searches for almost two months during this lockdown, finally come to conclusion, to purchase the printer which is available and affordable with cost of printer and cost per page of printing (b&w & color). Was confused to either go for HP or Epson. First wanted to go for only printer and not all in one, but for few thousand rupees, feels better to have AIO option incase future needs arise.Pros:1. Easy to install (after seeing some youtube videos), inserting ink in tank is super easy, no waste of ink, hands clean.2. Print quality was good.Cons:1. I tried to use OTG cable with mobile to take print but cannot print with HP Smart app, as the printer is not at all detectable in HP Smart app. Spoken to hp service, they also said this print is not supportive to OTG-Mobile use. But after searching few more option such Printershare which is paid version but finally tried nokoprint  and it solved the issue with nokoprint. So only regret that HP original software cannot give printing solution via mobile. Request them to work on it.I will make further review after few months."
4,As usual Hp blacktext prints are crisper than epson  and are better. The black ink does not wash off with rain water (tested on rain water ) .as a office printer  does everything . I do miss the wireless function at 7400 i am happy with the purchase . printed a whole page photo print on  5 rs desmat photo paper . print does not scrap away as reviewed by others. Photo print is not as best as epson but i can say its 90 % of epson photo print .  1 issue i had that the warranty showed to be 4 months  left only  which nearly gave me a heart attack . i have my friends at Iqor which are the service providers of Hp laptops & printers and they assured me the warranty  starts with the  gst bill . ( On the safe side i asked for an installation and the warranty date got rectified .)
1,"This printer has given me nothing but headaches! Just after 3 months of use and less than 50 print outs, both cartridge got damaged. Since it was on warranty, they serviced it free of cost. Exactly one year after purchase, the paper feeding mechanism has become faulty. Also, the print of low quality and very slow. I think they have supplied me a defective piece when I got it in Diwali offer (Rs 7999)."
5,"If you are looking for some printer which has high quality prints, and operation cost is low, ink tank printers are the choice you should consider. Also, Ink tanks printer don't dry up even when not used for sometime. The filling of ink is also something which is spill proof. So overall and a very good purchase."
5,I knew well that HP was a good company and it proved again!! Superb print quality. Only disadvantage is that it has no adjust feature to control black and colour print. Xeroxes are  good. Any colour they give. Superb model.... Easy to install. I printed over 100 pages in 3 days and only 2ml of black was used. Ink quality very good. Worth of its price!Stay Home And Stay Safe. Buy HP without any thought! üôèüôèüòÉ
4,"Nice printer, giving one star less as it's only 1 week of using"
3,Worst HP support.... No one will come for installation or for tech assist. Print quality is better. But while printing from web page of from email the font is too low and just get printer in a corner of a a4 and no way you can change the font size. That menu option will not be available while printing from web. But printing from MS word is OK. No tech can fix this even assisted almost 10 Times with remote support. But they won send a tech to home also.... On site warranty is just fake.
4,Going through some reviews it was a bit disappointing at first but after some research I found it satisfied enough to go ahead and order it. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to install it. All you need to do is Dowload 100 + mb printer software and you're done. Took 40-45 minutes to complete the process. Only hope that it's economical in the long run. (fingers crossed)
5,We bought this printer 15 days back. It's a good one. Ita got scanner n printing option. we tried printing on a photo paper the print was good but it leaves a black soot kind of thing after sometime on the surface. Not sure it's the same with other brand.  Other than tat its good.We installed the printer on own.The person who was assigned to instal dint help us in anyway. While unboxing he kept on saying without a CD I won't touch it even after informing tat it's not needed and also not included in the box n he left. Other representative was helpful on the phone n helped us.The printer is good.
3,"A good product - - poor service.Printer is good, build quality is well enough. But please ensure not to load too many sheets in the tray, else they might get jammed.Service wise, Amazon is too bad in terms od service. The seller shipped the product with incorrect serial number, today I'm trying third time to get this one fixed with Amazon support. All they do is just send a so called note to the seller and ask me to wait and check my mail some time later.Support by HP is also not as expected. Don't try their whatsapp support, it literally sucks. My printer got jammed, I read online help, and fixed it all by my own. They reverted via whatsapp after 3 days."
1,The discription of item is musleading.It is simply a connecting cable rather it shows fingure scanner more prominently .
3,Lot of Technical issues.
2,Product is now diffect small and sort
1,CCD CABLE LENGTH IS SMALL.SCX4521F
4,color vary but it works perfectly. worth to buy this cable
5,Good
5,"I love this printer. This is the 316 All in one. It doesnot have wifi,so it's not a wireless printer. But the best part is that you can buy a small connector OTG for connecting your android phone with this printer, download the HP Print Service Plugin app on your phone and get to printing directly from the phone. The print quality is good. The print outs don't come out at the same speed as they come out of a laserjet black and white printer ( i also have a Ricoh black and white printer/scanner/copier). One coloured print out takes almost 40-50 seconds. It's small in size and the coloured bottles come along with the printer. The 310,316,319 series is a series of non wireless printers with not much difference in their functions but instead difference in the amount of colour bottles given with them. The 410 series is truly wireless and you can buy those only if you have much use of a coloured printer daily and you want to invest over 10000 bucks. You need to take a printout once or twice every week for the printer ink to not dry. I have been using this for almost a month now and it has been working wonderfully. The only thing i have been not been able to resolve is that i can print not directly from my Gallery of phone but i have to use Google Photos app to get the print option. I got this for 8100 rs in prime day sale so it's totally worth it.. delivery was smooth and fast and the printer was received in very fine condition. Good job Amazon.Edit after 2 months of use: The printer started showing paper jam error. We followed the instructions on the HP page to resolve the problem but there wasn't any paper jam anywhere. Called the customer care number after sign in with the email id and they promptly sent an engineer to resolve the issue.( In actual the cartridge was jammed.) He told us the paper roller is not working,placed an order immediately and within 2 days the new part was put in the printer, with the printer working properly again. So full marks to HP for their customer service, although I didn't expect the printer to develop a snag when we have been using it very carefully."
4,Installation is quite tough. The software and driver's not available online for this printer and when I connect through HP Easy Start it detects HP ink tank 310 instead of 316. No proper instructions given in user manual not clear pictures to remove dummy print head and how to insert color/black print head.. otherwise it's good products..print quality is not up to mark but that's ok for this price..
1,"This is worst product i ever purchased from hp.First of all my old ink adavantage 3545 cartridge based inkjet printer prints much superior quality than this and with faster speed this printer prints 50 pages in 90 minutes.Ans also company claim of 4000 black, 6000 color pages goes wrong i have printed 1500 pages and black ink got depleted whereas color ink got half. (was printing a book only)Duplex printing is a joke. When u trying to do so, started with ok but later random pages printing."
4,Verry verry good product.Cheap in the best.
4,"I really liked using the HP printer printer. I bought the printer for 8499 rupees.And this model of HP is the new model.And the black ink bottle that is given here has ink here 170ml which is what other HP printers have 135ml I am getting a big benefit here I am getting 170ml bottle here.And with that I got two little books. It was nice to use, but it would be better to use it for the house.E-print is a picture that takes a little longer to print very well but the picture is very good. I printed my family album in this HP printer and it is printing very well with  inkjet photo paper paper. But one complaint I will make here is that HP Ray is commenting that our color ink can be printed in 8000 and black and white can be printed in 7500. I think this is a complete lie. It is impossible.Another thing I don't like though is that or this problem is with every printer. If I don't print for several days then the print heads get jammed. That's a big problem. I think the company should fix something.............. have used this printer for 20 days and I have shared with you as much as I can find out about this printer using these twenty days. Thank you."
3,"Previously used canon ink tank printer, which was far better than hp in colour production,not satisfied with scanning quality also, feeling bad for not opting canon again.Yhink twice if can't compromise the printing quality"
4,"Good printer for document only , not for photo page, you can also take print from mobile through OTG cable , I already tested with android device using type C OTG cable"
5,"I am writing the review after using it for a month.PROS:Reasonable CostEasy to use - I tried by connecting to the system via USB and connected to mobile via OTG cable. Both are working fine. I am using third-party software when connected via OTG and all is good.Black & White print is good. Clear, crisp print without any markings.The color print in A4 size paper is really good.Color Photos using 200 GSM 4*6 are good, but not as effective as photo studio print. The color is touching the hand when I selected the best quality, but the photos are looking good.Left unused for 15 days and the printer worked without any hassle.CONS:Unable to get a printer cover, but didn't find any so far.When connected via an OTG cable, HP software is not working.Need to place the printer in a proper place as the color tank is attached as an extension to the printer.If you can spend some more money then go for the WIFI model so that you can do print from anywhere.This printer is not having Auto Duplex printing so need to do it manually page by page."
3,"Really difficult installation process and no one helps. Sent many messages for HP, emails and phone call. But no one helped and I actually had to do it myself."
1,Worst printing experience. 1 out of 15 papers get stuck inside the printer and we have to open the printer to find torn paper. Don't waste money buying this printer. HP support is complete waste of time and they don't give you any resolution. Stay away from this printer at all cost.
1,"i bought the printer two months ago & it stopped working all of a sudden. I have raised case with HP, however there is zero response from the HP. every time i call support center they says i will get a call within 24-48 hrs, and guess what.. u never get the response from them. I 'm regretting, so dont want you guys to fall on the trap. HP has worst after sale support, pls go for canon or other vendor."
5,"Sorry to add this review after a week but this is a must buy product.I love the printing quality of this printer.I have received my printer in just 4 days. Packing of the product is same as you buy from a shop it includes everything, Wire, ink bottles , instruction manual. Although the colour ink bottles will fill your tank only once and If you fill full ink tank then bottle will get empty in one go but black ink bottle is bigger then coloured ones so you can fill your tank twice. Installation is also easy you can watch the installation on youtube videos.All an all i love the product."
1,"This product has unreliable wireless connection, which maybe lost if you are not paying attention. Once lost, any print commands you may input are met with an error and would not be cleared unless you restart the printer, else printer status may appear busy perpetually. This was about the frustrating operating experience, 10 pages took 2 valuable hours of my life.Now considering I had spend 2 hours of my life of a few pages, the least I could expect is a good print quality as a reward for my tiring efforts. Alas! The print quality is mediocre at best. I've only been able to print out 10 actual pages, but my ink tanks are already 20% gone! Why? That's because of all the mistakes this dumb printer has made during the printing process. 2nd half of the page disappears! And not to mention the whole bunch of ""test"" pages I'm stuck with, which I didn't even ask for! I could've even printed a whole novel with the ink and pages that I have wasted with this printer.This review marks the end of my short relationship with HP products. Adios."
5,Very good all in one. Got in the sale at 9499 less cashback. Colour and bw prints are very good. Scan takes sometime but result is very good. Can buy for home use.
5,Pros:  Cheaper than other 310 series printer  Good print  Delivery was fast with in 3 daysCons :  Made in CHINA  No wifi
4,I'm writing review after using 10 days well it's money worthy and also the quality is very high but I have faced little problem while installing the driver and search for driver on website because it not comes with CD. And this is easy to use. But I'm waiting to see will this print  6000 to 8000 pages as written by manufacturer.
1,No installation support by HP
5,"Very Good Printer, print quality is excellent, easy to install, no sound during printing.Fully satisfied.One can always rely on HP brand"
3,"The printer takes a lot of time to print, oreven take a copy, the print quality is not satisfying. Just because it's an ink tank, the price is fine but the print quality is really degraded. I have was using an HP printer earlier but it's quality was much better. Regret buying this. You can buy this if you want to Compromise on quality."
1,The worst thing is that about this printer its very slow have to wait for 50 sec. For one print. Not recommended for bulk print.
1,will never deal with Hp one of my worse experience after buying printer.please urge people not to go for HP
1,Horrible experience plz don't buy HP printer of this model. They don't support for home installation.
5,Excellent product. Watch print head installation and ink filling on YouTube.
1,Rcvd a broken printer. Its ink tank is attached awkwardly. It was broken during transportation.
4,Reason for only 4 stars is this printer isnt plug and play for windows 10...Need to install drivers which is slightly a hectic job when all rest of the companies provide plug and play drivers
5,"It works well and very fast enough to make question paper at affordable cost. But, only thing I don't like about it was that it do not comes with wi-fi connectivity."
4,VALUE FOR MONEY.... I THINK IT IS BETTER THAT EPSON INKTANK PRINTERS  COZ IT  IS MOST CHEAPER ITS HEAD IS ALSO BETTER AND AVAILABLE AT LOWER PRICE THAN EPPSON
1,"Received Fake HP printer, I came to k ow about the same after 11 months when the serial no of the printer didn't match when I have to service the same.Even Amazon didn't supported me."
4,Printer is good. Mobile printing via USB is too slow like a snail. Colour print quality is average.
1,Scanner in product is worse
5,Printer is the best from best choice when you buying a ink tank printer under 11000
1,Don't purchase this printer...1st of all very slow then sometimes it just forget about the pending prints. Then you have to restart & again commend the print for your requirements.
3,Paper stuck during printing. Speed is slow. Cost is ok
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"Previously I was using HP Deskjet ink Printer 3545e, replacing cartridges costed me around 1500 and then if i don't use it for a while ink was getting dried up fast. So i taught of upgrading to a Ink Tank printer then I decided to purchase HP Smart Tank 530. When my product finally arrived, after using it for a while then I realised it was really a bad decision to go for HP Smart Ink Printer. I dint face issues with the print quality, print quality is great but the main two issues i faced with the printer was touchscreen was not so responsive and in between the display freezes. Second issue was with the built quality Hp has used low cost plastic to built this printer im not sure how long i can use this printer.  My personal suggestion is that please don‚Äôt  buy HP Smart Tank 530 Printer rather consider buying Epson Printers or other good hp printer models which will last for long and wont regret later."
1,"The printer is easy to install and doing average printing, there is no installation from hp or Amazon provided. And print quality is ok or same like 410 in price of 11000 and I feel I made wrong selection in high cost.Moreover whenever I print on gloss sheets the colors are comes out on my hands.and printout fades.very very bad product in high price.not to recommend anyone"
1,Was delivered a defective product. Moreover while checking online support on HP's website we found out that the warranty period start date was August 27 when we had purchased the product on December 25. I guess the reseller is trying to scam innocent buyers. Be aware.
5,Pros :-*Wifi printing is effective*HP Warranty is covered (provided you have registered the product )*HP installation is applicable*Anywhere printing through HP smart app or email*Printer quality is good*Works with Alexa seamlessly* Touch screen pad is smooth* extended warranty is recommendedCons :-*Automatic duplex printing  is not available this is the biggest drawback with such an expensive printer .*Little Noisy* printing tray doesn‚Äôt hold printouts effectively . Papers fell down after 2 to 3 printouts* printer may have 10 to 15 days old warranty as the product is sold by reseller on amazon . Do check this immediately on HP website before you install
5,"This printer from HP is an awesome one. It has Wireless , Wifi Direct, USB connectivity.A real time Ink Level indicator is what i like. You dont have to either print printer status report or check it using front panel or using printer software.2 Black ink bottles are provided in the box.Setup was smooth. HP Smart App supported.Overall a good product from HP."
5,"I received brand new seal packed product. Initially while setup, I added ink and then when I have to install cartridges and print the alignment page,  then i saw the holder where we have to fit the cartridges it was hitting the printer left and right very hard and not stopping in the middle. I called HP support and they tried to solve the issue over phone with sew trouble shooting steps. However result was same. HP arranged the service call for me and I also talked to amazon support for the issue. I explained them that I got faulty product which I can to know after inserted the ink so  I was hesitated to return the product as this might be given to someone else. But Amazon says, this is not my (ME) issue and will be taken care by Amazon even product is opened and they arranged the return and refund as same product was not available anymore with them.5 star for AMAZON.Both HP and Amazon was scheduled for next day. Luckily HP guy came firs and fixed the issue in 2 minute by unscrewing 4 screw and placed the transparent encoded strip in position (sensor behind cartage holder). He said this might happened in transport. Once it worked, i canceled the return request.5 star for HP support.Printer:Black ink is pigment and hence once printed on paper it is waterproof even if you put the printed paper in the bucket full of water.Color is not waterproof, however they don't fade easily.ADF: This is the plus advantage in this printer over HP 515. Just keep the bundle of paper in ADF and get the scanned or copy without any mess.INK: I got 3 color (GT 52 70 ml), Magenta, Cyan, Yellow each and 3 black (GT 52 XL 135 ml) you will get only 1 black in HP 515 which is 2000 cheaperOverall printer is good.5 star for Printer."
3,"Print quality is excellent but when you print via Wifi, printing speed is slow (can be ignored).It has been just a week now, very often noticing cartridge issue. After couple of prints have to open the door and set the cartridge.Other than this haven't noticed any issue."
1,Video Player is loading.
1,1 page printing it's take 1 min (60 sec. )Very slow printing.High quality printing.After 2 .months ink pipes is blocked automatically. . RS 17000 loss
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
5,"Good Printer which is very easy to install and given by many videos  online. The process is very simple to install and completes in 15 mins. Its perfect for the home printings with kids online classes and work from home prints.Pros :- Excellent print quality - awesome color prints and black and white.- Excellent Wifi connectivity- Awesome ADF - can scan the 40+ pages in one go- super easy ink refill, and no spilling of ink- HP Smart app was easy to set-up and use"
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
1,I BROUGHT HP 530 INKTANK PRINTER ON AMAZON SITE. THE PRINTER PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGNING. SO MANY TIMES COMPALINT RAISE. NO USE. ONE OR TWO TIMES SERVE TECNICIAN CAME AND CHANGE CARTIDGES BUT NO USE . AGAIN AND AGAIN COMPLAINT. NEXT THE TECHNICAIN CAME AND REPLACE PRINTER. BUT FEW DAYS OK AFTER THAT PRINTER PAPER JAM AND PAPER TORN. AND NOW THE PRINTE TOTAL DEAD POWER NOT ON. AGAIN COPMPALINT RAISE. BUT TECNICIAN NOT COME.SO HP SEVERVICES IS SO BAD.It's their job to buy HP products by mistake
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
4,"I have upgraded from a Canon printer and I feel it is worth the money spent.Overall:-  Print quality is very good for normal printing. Documents color and b/w are extremely good on normal quality mode.- Photo print quality is good for personal use. It is comparable to some of the prints I have received from photo-studio. However if you are looking for high quality professional photos, this may not meet your expectation and those printers are quite expensive.- There are review comments about ink not drying on photo paper: To avoid this, you have to set the paper type as ""HP Photo Paper"" or ""Other injet Photo Paper""  depending on you paper while printing. Also ensure to use good quality phot paper.- There are few review comments about paper falling off after printing: Again I have found that the out paper tray has two stop options, if you pull it max, then paper does not fall-off.- 2 sided printing and 2 sided scanning is available, but the paper has to be loaded manually after onside is completed. This option works only from desktop, HP smart app on mobile does not provide this feature.- Online HP support is quite useful. The executive tries to help you over phone and if required can take remote access of your system to provide support.- Noise is not too much. If you still want a silent printer, there is quite mode, but the printing speed will be very slow.Printing Speed: Not as advertised but should be quite okay for personal use.Fist attempt - A4 color copy in normal quality took 1min 10 second. and Normal quality color print on photo paper took 4 minutes.Second attempt after cleaning head and alignment: 30 seconds for A4 size photo print in best quality (photo paper)Wifi connectivity: It is quite easy to setup wifi, however I had some initial glitches where the printer was connecting only to 5Gz and not on 2.4GHz. Connected with HP support, but they could not solve the issue. I reset the printer to factory defaults and after that the problem got sorted out.HP Smart App has good option on desktop, but on mobile it has very limited option for settings. This could have been improved.What I liked most:1. ADF allow me to scan/copy bunch of papers together.2. Printer can connect to both 2.4 & 5Hz network simultaneously3. Wifi-Direct option allows to print direct without connecting to network4. HPePrint option is useful if you want to print document from a remote location."
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
5,I bought this printer for 16200rs at sale with card discount. Printing speed is good.First day I had to print around 250 pages (2 sides).It costed me around 200rs approx If I had got it printed at shop It would have costed me atleast 500rs.Two issues I had noticed so far.1. For 2 side prints we have to print one side for all pages and put it back into feed. During this process I once got mismatch front back print because 1 of the first side print had 2 pages stuck together because of which mismatch happened while printing the second side.2. I have two laptop both running windows 10 out of which one laptop was able to install hp printer drivers easily but the second was not able to download the drivers. Not sure what the issue is.If you are looking for printing duplex(2 side print) in large quantity then I would suggest you to go for printer with proper duplex print where you dont have to manually print the second side.I haven't tried printing from mobile but will update once I do.Hope you find this review helpful.
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
1,Almost using the printer for 6 months and the problems are1.always showing paper size mismatch2.every time it has communication error ...al the print command stored in que and suddenly it prints all of them at once3.Takes lot of time to boot up4.Worst service of HP .....At least booked call for 5 times no body reaches and the complains automatically closed.
1,Prints very slow.Print quality is very bad in both color and b&w.Doesn't maintain proper margins on A4 paper. You have to select Letter for proper prints.Body paint peels off. Brand new printer looks like a three year old badly used printer in a week.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I‚Äôm already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn‚Äôt have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
5,"Value Product. Don't think more, just go for it. Printing is awesome and very easy to install, but you also contact hp care for installation i.e. free.Most important Amazon (Appario Retail Private Ltd) have done a wonderful job in delivering the product."
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
2,At this price segment this printer is waste of money I am totally unsatisfied with its printing and scanning quality. After 3 to 5 pages print I mark that little much ink is flow around the text and also during the scan it's pixel density is very low
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
5,Excellent product however vendor has to be bit carefull while package such crtical device. Packing was not good and high chamces of product damage during delivery. Otherwise delivery was on time.. I am happy with the product

5,I like
1,Highly annoyed. The seeker thought he would be able to cheat by packaging the product in such a way that he would be able to hide all the defects. It looks rather like a 3-4 year old second hand printer. The lid was broken. The parts looked worn outThere was no cartridge and USB cable in the box. I would rather buy from official HP site. It‚Äôs also cheaper over thereThis is in addition. It‚Äôs been over a week and the return has not been made so my money is stuck so I would recommend you guys not to buy from Amazon. I am one of the unlucky guy whose money is stuck. You could be the next one. I have called Amazon more the 10 times still no update from them.
1,"Do not purchase this product. Waste of money. It is having cartridge issues. Even though I installed SETUP cartridge which came along with the product, it is showing error to install SETUP cartridge."
5,Works very well! Print quality is good and speed also good. Works like a charm on wireless network via mobile app! Not tested via USB yet.Arrived on time thanks to amazon logistics!
5,"(I'm writing this detailed review as I saw there is a lack thereof for this specific model).To start off, the grey and white combo is absolutely divine to look at and very modern + minimal. The printer is exquisite in performance. I'm not a heavy printer user so the requirements might differ but for normal printing usage - documents, project etc. this printer serves the need. After trying out all its features here are my thoughts:1. Setup (takes a while)If you get this printer, the lack of steps to be able to set it up is quite a way around to figure. I actually saw multiple YouTube videos and still didn't get the full picture. So here's my suggestion, once you switch on the printer and the light is blinking next to the power button, headover to HP Smart App on your system (laptop/PC). Trust me the phone app is not worth using for setting it up in time. After you open the app on your system, follow the instructions until the setup finishes. After which hold down the Page button and the info button together for a couple of secs to print the instructions to connect wirelessly. Once you receive that headover to the wifi connection settings in your system, select the printer, choose to enter a security key and enter the code from the print out. Once done, the welcome page will then print and everything is pretty straightforward from there.2. Colour printI would rate the colour print quality about 3 out of 5. Okay for normal use but definitely not a high quality to be printing high def pictures for sure - if colour accuracy is what you're after. But at this price range, that shouldn't be your primary requirement. A normal document with 30% images takes about a min to print.3. B/W printHonestly this is the amazing quality that I expected and it delivered. 5/5 for this - no bleeding, proper edge detection, no creases and absolute clarity.4. ScanNow one of the features that I like is the ability to scan and edit it on the HP Smart App itself. So if you're scanning some pics, you can opt for 1200 dpi (which is crazy) but it takes quite some time - at least 3-4 mins or so depending on the file. However for documents and all, 300dpi default works great and gets done in under a min. You have the option to save the scanned items as pdf or jpeg.5. Wifi accessAfter setting up the wifi direct access, it's not complicated and connects efficiently but be weary as you might not be able to access the internet on your system and wirelessly connect to the printer at the same time. Other than that, it's a pretty efficient way of getting things printed or scanned without needing to be physically next to the printer. I live in a 3 bhk and could easily connect from my room to the printer in the living room.6. Mobile accessSo you can access the printer functions from the HP Smart App on the phone (pretty much the same functions as from the system) however to actually print wirelessly you'll also have to download and setup HP Print Service Plugin. After which it's very easy to print anything from the phone. So I'll rate it 5/5 as it easily makes it more accessible.I have yet to test out the cartridge life but the above is my detailed initial impression of all the features. Hope this help! Would definitely recommend it easily for a purchase."
5,"I don't know why people complaining about the speed of the printer. The printing speed is well upto the mark, even above the mark if it is printing in draft mode. Obviously it is not a laser printer.Installation is hassle-free. Connection is very stable (have not checked USB connection). Print quality is very good. I have also printed from different devices like mobile, laptop and tablet. Only thing is that for android devices, it is by default changing quality to Normal Mode, not Draft mode.Regarding cartridge, till date I have printed 20-25 A4 pages including 5-6 colour prints, still the printer is showing the cartridges are full. Will update when the cartridges empties."
5,"very good affordable wifi printer. courier service was good. the product i received at port blair in very good condition. no damage happened with the product even for a large distance with the mainland India. second thing if u have windows 10 then there is no problem installing this printer with your computer but if u want to install it at your windows 7 then its bit hectic. i have installed this printer with my windows 7 laptop. for installing with windows 7 u need to go to the hp support website and get the driver from there. u will also need a good internet speed to download and install the software for your computer online. but using wifi service with the printer is very easy. In this printer u will get wifi direct, that means u can connect directly with the printer with your phone and give print command. for that service u need to install two apps in your phone, 1st is hp smart app and then hp print service plugin app. once the apps are installed in your phone, create a account with hp. once it is done, u can give print command from your phone for documents printing or photo printing without connecting your phone and printer with any network. print quality is also good . the best part of the printer is it supports 4*6 paper also."
1,"This printer is just a way for HP to make you their customer so that you have to buy their expensive cartridges (800 rupees) every week or so. One cartridge is able to print only 25-28 pages which makes the average cost of one page to almost rupees 30/page. This is the worst investment you can make for a printer. Don't get manipulated seeing the cost of the printer as eventual costs of running would be too high to sustain. Also, the return window closes in 7 days so until you realize how useless this printer is, the window will already been closed and you're now stuck with a useless, too-expensive-to-run printer."
4,"Good printer in this wifi catagory for this money of 5200Rs. (I got through ICICI coupon 500rs hence 5200rs from 5700rs original price). Installation is very easy but instruction sheet confusing. Just connect in wifi and give print from any pc, phone, laptop..it's working fine. Don't connnect usb cable , install HP app etc .no need. I did and wasted many hours.Ensure giving B/w print only if colour is obsooute necessary. Try to avoid full background or photo printing as it consumes more ink and soon you will see catrdiges empty.Tips: load 5 to 8 sheets only maximum in the upper tray every time.Try to order different verison of Printer without scanning function. I ordered this and later found scanning not at all used. Online class scanning can be done through phone appsOverall I am satisfactory."
4,"I have it now for 2.months and I used it for 100s of printouts on recycled papers,good quality A4 sheets and also on Glossy sheets for printouts of pictures. Everything is good just that it eats up a lottttt of coloured ink!!! I had to change my ink cartridge thrice in just 2 months!!"
4,"Surprisingly, within 2 months of buying this printer, it has started giving problems!! With a 1 year warranty u don‚Äôt expect this at all from a renowned company like HP!!Work is being affected due to the printer not working and we have to spend money on outside printing work! Don‚Äôt know also wjom to contact for services n repairs"
3,Very cheap material used for paper feed tray holder. It was broken on first use to hold papers.  The two pieces that hold the paper tray to an angle were already broken. Packaging was not sealed at all.Interestingly printer was wrapped in a plastic cover making it look completely unused but it is hard to say if it is a refurbished or reused/returned product.Print Head alignment does not work easily.
1,I had huge connectivity issues and the there is no response from service of Hp . Pathetic . Don‚Äôt buy
3,I ordered the printer on 21 April. I have hardly printed 60 - 70 pages mostly in grayscale. And the ink has dried up. Both black and tricolour ink dried up within two months itself.(I have already replaced the black cartridge on 21 June). This is unacceptable as it claims of printing at  least 400 pages. I would want a replacement of the cartridges.
1,Cartridge buy buy kar kar ke aasmaan taare grah sb dikhayi denge 10 pages print kiye sirf or colour cartridgeJawaab de gyiü§£ü§£ü§£
5,"For medium printing, this works well & easy to install, light weight. So overall a good printer for Home/ small office work."
3,"Printing is very slow, especially when connected via wireless, print quality is OK type, good enough for emergency use"
2,"The quality of the print is good but the print output from each cartridge is much lower than what is indicated for the product. Even after selecting greyscale (black and white mode), printing in draft mode, the colour cartridges are running low on ink."
5,Product looks exactly like the photo. Installation was simple and easy. Printing speed is great. Overall good printer to have for home use.
3,Printing is very slow and even many times wifi connectivity issues.i would say this printer won't work as expected
5,Very good for home use.I am enjoying it well.Refilling shops are very less for this catridge which is the only problem I saw
5,Good print quality but installation process is very mind disturbing because when we want to give print via our mobile and at that time you have to face many problem in installation.
3,Suitable for home printing. Printing done only after connecting to computer. Wireless feature does not work.
5,Struggled for initial setup.. Later it's a smooth walk.
5,Best for Kids School print
5,Hoping that cartridges would always be priced economical as the name suggests.
3,The product software has many bugs. Always facing problem in connecting with laptop. The print quality is average.
1,PRINTER MAY BE CHEAP BUT INK CARTRIDGES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE AND DON'T LAST LONG.

1,"Previously I was using HP Deskjet ink Printer 3545e, replacing cartridges costed me around 1500 and then if i don't use it for a while ink was getting dried up fast. So i taught of upgrading to a Ink Tank printer then I decided to purchase HP Smart Tank 530. When my product finally arrived, after using it for a while then I realised it was really a bad decision to go for HP Smart Ink Printer. I dint face issues with the print quality, print quality is great but the main two issues i faced with the printer was touchscreen was not so responsive and in between the display freezes. Second issue was with the built quality Hp has used low cost plastic to built this printer im not sure how long i can use this printer.  My personal suggestion is that please don‚Äôt  buy HP Smart Tank 530 Printer rather consider buying Epson Printers or other good hp printer models which will last for long and wont regret later."
1,"The printer is easy to install and doing average printing, there is no installation from hp or Amazon provided. And print quality is ok or same like 410 in price of 11000 and I feel I made wrong selection in high cost.Moreover whenever I print on gloss sheets the colors are comes out on my hands.and printout fades.very very bad product in high price.not to recommend anyone"
1,Was delivered a defective product. Moreover while checking online support on HP's website we found out that the warranty period start date was August 27 when we had purchased the product on December 25. I guess the reseller is trying to scam innocent buyers. Be aware.
5,Pros :-*Wifi printing is effective*HP Warranty is covered (provided you have registered the product )*HP installation is applicable*Anywhere printing through HP smart app or email*Printer quality is good*Works with Alexa seamlessly* Touch screen pad is smooth* extended warranty is recommendedCons :-*Automatic duplex printing  is not available this is the biggest drawback with such an expensive printer .*Little Noisy* printing tray doesn‚Äôt hold printouts effectively . Papers fell down after 2 to 3 printouts* printer may have 10 to 15 days old warranty as the product is sold by reseller on amazon . Do check this immediately on HP website before you install
5,"This printer from HP is an awesome one. It has Wireless , Wifi Direct, USB connectivity.A real time Ink Level indicator is what i like. You dont have to either print printer status report or check it using front panel or using printer software.2 Black ink bottles are provided in the box.Setup was smooth. HP Smart App supported.Overall a good product from HP."
5,"I received brand new seal packed product. Initially while setup, I added ink and then when I have to install cartridges and print the alignment page,  then i saw the holder where we have to fit the cartridges it was hitting the printer left and right very hard and not stopping in the middle. I called HP support and they tried to solve the issue over phone with sew trouble shooting steps. However result was same. HP arranged the service call for me and I also talked to amazon support for the issue. I explained them that I got faulty product which I can to know after inserted the ink so  I was hesitated to return the product as this might be given to someone else. But Amazon says, this is not my (ME) issue and will be taken care by Amazon even product is opened and they arranged the return and refund as same product was not available anymore with them.5 star for AMAZON.Both HP and Amazon was scheduled for next day. Luckily HP guy came firs and fixed the issue in 2 minute by unscrewing 4 screw and placed the transparent encoded strip in position (sensor behind cartage holder). He said this might happened in transport. Once it worked, i canceled the return request.5 star for HP support.Printer:Black ink is pigment and hence once printed on paper it is waterproof even if you put the printed paper in the bucket full of water.Color is not waterproof, however they don't fade easily.ADF: This is the plus advantage in this printer over HP 515. Just keep the bundle of paper in ADF and get the scanned or copy without any mess.INK: I got 3 color (GT 52 70 ml), Magenta, Cyan, Yellow each and 3 black (GT 52 XL 135 ml) you will get only 1 black in HP 515 which is 2000 cheaperOverall printer is good.5 star for Printer."
3,"Print quality is excellent but when you print via Wifi, printing speed is slow (can be ignored).It has been just a week now, very often noticing cartridge issue. After couple of prints have to open the door and set the cartridge.Other than this haven't noticed any issue."
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
5,"Good Printer which is very easy to install and given by many videos  online. The process is very simple to install and completes in 15 mins. Its perfect for the home printings with kids online classes and work from home prints.Pros :- Excellent print quality - awesome color prints and black and white.- Excellent Wifi connectivity- Awesome ADF - can scan the 40+ pages in one go- super easy ink refill, and no spilling of ink- HP Smart app was easy to set-up and use"
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
1,I BROUGHT HP 530 INKTANK PRINTER ON AMAZON SITE. THE PRINTER PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGNING. SO MANY TIMES COMPALINT RAISE. NO USE. ONE OR TWO TIMES SERVE TECNICIAN CAME AND CHANGE CARTIDGES BUT NO USE . AGAIN AND AGAIN COMPLAINT. NEXT THE TECHNICAIN CAME AND REPLACE PRINTER. BUT FEW DAYS OK AFTER THAT PRINTER PAPER JAM AND PAPER TORN. AND NOW THE PRINTE TOTAL DEAD POWER NOT ON. AGAIN COPMPALINT RAISE. BUT TECNICIAN NOT COME.SO HP SEVERVICES IS SO BAD.It's their job to buy HP products by mistake
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
4,"I have upgraded from a Canon printer and I feel it is worth the money spent.Overall:-  Print quality is very good for normal printing. Documents color and b/w are extremely good on normal quality mode.- Photo print quality is good for personal use. It is comparable to some of the prints I have received from photo-studio. However if you are looking for high quality professional photos, this may not meet your expectation and those printers are quite expensive.- There are review comments about ink not drying on photo paper: To avoid this, you have to set the paper type as ""HP Photo Paper"" or ""Other injet Photo Paper""  depending on you paper while printing. Also ensure to use good quality phot paper.- There are few review comments about paper falling off after printing: Again I have found that the out paper tray has two stop options, if you pull it max, then paper does not fall-off.- 2 sided printing and 2 sided scanning is available, but the paper has to be loaded manually after onside is completed. This option works only from desktop, HP smart app on mobile does not provide this feature.- Online HP support is quite useful. The executive tries to help you over phone and if required can take remote access of your system to provide support.- Noise is not too much. If you still want a silent printer, there is quite mode, but the printing speed will be very slow.Printing Speed: Not as advertised but should be quite okay for personal use.Fist attempt - A4 color copy in normal quality took 1min 10 second. and Normal quality color print on photo paper took 4 minutes.Second attempt after cleaning head and alignment: 30 seconds for A4 size photo print in best quality (photo paper)Wifi connectivity: It is quite easy to setup wifi, however I had some initial glitches where the printer was connecting only to 5Gz and not on 2.4GHz. Connected with HP support, but they could not solve the issue. I reset the printer to factory defaults and after that the problem got sorted out.HP Smart App has good option on desktop, but on mobile it has very limited option for settings. This could have been improved.What I liked most:1. ADF allow me to scan/copy bunch of papers together.2. Printer can connect to both 2.4 & 5Hz network simultaneously3. Wifi-Direct option allows to print direct without connecting to network4. HPePrint option is useful if you want to print document from a remote location."
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
5,I bought this printer for 16200rs at sale with card discount. Printing speed is good.First day I had to print around 250 pages (2 sides).It costed me around 200rs approx If I had got it printed at shop It would have costed me atleast 500rs.Two issues I had noticed so far.1. For 2 side prints we have to print one side for all pages and put it back into feed. During this process I once got mismatch front back print because 1 of the first side print had 2 pages stuck together because of which mismatch happened while printing the second side.2. I have two laptop both running windows 10 out of which one laptop was able to install hp printer drivers easily but the second was not able to download the drivers. Not sure what the issue is.If you are looking for printing duplex(2 side print) in large quantity then I would suggest you to go for printer with proper duplex print where you dont have to manually print the second side.I haven't tried printing from mobile but will update once I do.Hope you find this review helpful.
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
1,Almost using the printer for 6 months and the problems are1.always showing paper size mismatch2.every time it has communication error ...al the print command stored in que and suddenly it prints all of them at once3.Takes lot of time to boot up4.Worst service of HP .....At least booked call for 5 times no body reaches and the complains automatically closed.
1,Prints very slow.Print quality is very bad in both color and b&w.Doesn't maintain proper margins on A4 paper. You have to select Letter for proper prints.Body paint peels off. Brand new printer looks like a three year old badly used printer in a week.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I‚Äôm already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn‚Äôt have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
5,"Value Product. Don't think more, just go for it. Printing is awesome and very easy to install, but you also contact hp care for installation i.e. free.Most important Amazon (Appario Retail Private Ltd) have done a wonderful job in delivering the product."
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
2,At this price segment this printer is waste of money I am totally unsatisfied with its printing and scanning quality. After 3 to 5 pages print I mark that little much ink is flow around the text and also during the scan it's pixel density is very low
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
5,Excellent product however vendor has to be bit carefull while package such crtical device. Packing was not good and high chamces of product damage during delivery. Otherwise delivery was on time.. I am happy with the product

2,Only 500 prints and ink level has reached half.Fake promising of 5k prints
1,Fast time hp said that no of print 5000But actually it's print 1000 so costing is high.
2,You are really chiting campany in hp printers 5k no printer500 page in one toner very badAnd very cast one page
1,"It worked fine for around 2 months. After it has printed around 500 pages, the toner level showed half and the prints started coming out very faded. I thought perhaps we should refill the toner. So I bought the genuine toner refill from HP website  and refilled the toner. Instantly the ink level showed 100%. But the print quality remained the same.I called HP support and after 45 minutes of call, the engineer said that the print head seems to be a problem and an engineer will visit me.I waited for 8 days, no one showed up. I called HP support again, they said contact TVS Electronics in Jayanagar, Bangalore. I tried calling them at least 200 times.. on various of their phone numbers listed on HP website and google. No use.I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!I wasted 20K on this printer, just because I trusted the HP brand. Another printer service centre ( who doesnt service HP Neverstop ) told me that this is a bad printer .. most people have print quality issues with this printer."
1,"Printer is not giving 5k print. Don't buy this. Nearly 500 pages comes out which add cost of ink too much in later stage. I believed in Hp promise but its fake. Within 1 month , i have filled 4 times. 500 pages per 1 fill.. Don't buy this."
1,"False claim of 5k prints,but in reality only 300-500 prints.Toner is also very expensive."
5,"Looks like a cute mini photo state machine.Need Windows 10 minimum for Desktop Computer. You must have a router and a Wi-Fi dongle in USB of Desktop. If you have Router then It is good else Windows 10 can start Hot spot with wifi dongle. You can buy dongle from near mobile store or from Amazon. An active internet Connection is compulsary to install setup files. Little bit network technical knowledge is needed.Just type web url for desktop and scan QR code from mobile camera. Link and QR code are printed with books received with the box.This printer can work as photocopier, scanner and printer. Only black and white.Extra cartridge not found but one cartridge within printer with full ink found.Value for money."
2,false promises of 5000 pages only 2500 pages print.this printer is good in quality and system but company claims first purchase 5000 page print. But printer print 2500 pages.

1,Horrible...... only one page is print and need to restart for printing every page...
5,Best multi purpose scanner printer.I am using hp printers for 20 years now.Now hp is in less plastic movement so this printer do not need to change whole cartridge. I can just refill it. Original refill pack is so much affordable now.I bought this printer for my office last year. And now bought it again for my second branch office.
2,this printer is good in quality and system but some ink problem one tonner can't print 800pages
1,Ink refil pump missing and CD driver
1,"This is very worst product from the manufacturer of H.P.  I never seen this type of bad functionality.  From day 1 it created problem.  Print quality and functionality is worst.  I request every customer not to chose this product.  All expectations were collapsed.  Seller not accepted to return back even requested immediately after purchase.  HP Company never provided any technical service.  I lost Rs.18,000/- for purchase of this printer.  Print quality is too much bad.  Seller advised to contact HP customer care, but Company of H.P. never responded to provide customer service.  This is very very very very bad and worst product of HP.  My rating is 0 star to this product"
4,"Taking print-out from android phone was flawless and very convinient. Establishment of wifi connection between phone and printer is very smooth. No specific app is required for printing from android phone. I have used Samsung J7 & Samsung A7 for this.But it was very difficult for me to install HP software in my Lenovo laptop having OS Windows 7 ultimate-64 bit via USB cable. Not a single software downloaded from official HP site viz Install Easy, Full Web Version, Version for- IT person only was successful. Later it was automatically installed by Windows update. No customer care mentioned in the documents are correct. I have received no call from HP regarding the setup/ installation of the item."
3,"This printer arrived with a leaky drum. What's more, the page count seems to be 24 more than actual (either zero not set correctly or used before shipping). The drum eventually got replaced through HP customer service, but getting through to HP and getting decent help online was a frustrating experience. So well over a month after purchase (of which the delay from my end was about 10 days) the printer is now set up and functional. And satisfactory so far. The ID printing option is convenient.Two disadvantages:1 The paper tray cover is very difficult to put in place and is really really irritating2 it does not print legal size (contrary to what the HP customer service told me on the phone). There is a range given for paper size but essentially you will be using only A4."
1,"I DONT LIKE THIS PRINTER SCANNER, THE PRINTER IS GOOD BUT SCAN QUALITY IS VERY POOR. AND IMAGES ARE CROPPING IN ONE SIDE. MEAN FULL IMAGE IS NOT SCANNING. I AM GOING TO BACK THIS PRODUCT."
5,"Good printer. Works well out of the box. I had some issue with wifi as my router didn't have a wps button. I was able to setup wifi printing by connecting to the printer using usb. Prints are good. If you don't need color, this is certainly a great printer. Able to print well using phone and windows laptop."
3,"Pros:PrintingSeamless setupCheaper refill costCons :It‚Äôs missing Ethernet ,Lacks auto duplex printing (not claimed, but still saying to clear if someone have doubt),comparatively weak WiFiPoor picture printing (might be due to wrong type...but not that great )Google cloud printing support is going away in Dec 2020"
2,"I don't have issue with the product only that I think I received a used product, as I'm trying to register for warranty but it's says already registered 4months  back ago. And the toner indicator shows already half have been used."
4,Very safely amazon delivered the product to my home... relieved my apprehension.
5,"If you are buying this with cloud print in mind google is removing its support for google cloud print for windows after December 31, 2020. Check google cloud print for an alternate solution. If u have apple products you can use air print with this.Other than this if you want to print directly with wifi direct it works flawlessly."
5,"It is almost an year now since I purchased. For people looking for black and white prints with reasonable good quality and affordable price, this is the printer I recommend."
1,"I am sorry to say that I am unable to use to this product due to there is no driver in the packet. As per written life-let I have to download it from Hp support, the website provided by HP for solution and supporting. I have tried so many time but even fruitless I am at the present. I need help to set up this printer in my desktop to use it.Thanking you."
5,"I HAVE SMALL BUSINESS, AND I FACED DIFFICULTIES TO CHOOSE A PRINTER BUT FINALLY I GOT GOOD ONE.. THANKS OTHER REVIEWER AND SELLER DESCRIPTION ..."
3,After refilling with original HP toner the printout is not good at all once it is refilled.
4,"It was said that back to back printing possible,but only manual possible.Anyway it is possible to print back to back.Black cartridge is not available in the HP store"
1,Printer is not good and so customer support.I complaint about bad printing 4 lines are printing at horizontal layout . Not solved until now
1,"The product has decent print quality, but as with every HP product in the market, refills of toner and cartridge are not available. Please buy printers where you can get a refill easily."
3,Nice but over price
1,braked within1 week on 4-5 scan

1,"Oct 24, 2019: Printer seems like a waste of money.Tri-Colour print head seems to have failed in a new device purchased in Mar 2019. No way of emailing HP product support. One of the ways I seemed to have done it from HP site (from my login there) never got me a response!=======The printer works extremely well & silently except for the following (note: All my devices are either MacOS or IOS):1. This printer was purchased from Amazon in March 2019, the warranty for the product (as per HP site) had started in December 2018!2. It does not switch off automatically in 2 hours - as per printer web-page this feature is pre-setup & cannot be altered3. No instructions on how to make the Manual Duplex feature work from a Print option (at least on MacOS)4. Knowledgeable/ trouble shooting guides have no information on this5. Due to Ink-Tank feature, it is not easy to just ""pick-up"" the printer & carry it - it has to be kept horizontal to avoid ink spills, so carrying to an HP service centre is out of question.6. The Chat Bot on HP website cannot answer anything that you cannot read in a manual - it is totally useless & does not even recognise that it should redirect the person to a human.7. All support information is for Windows devices - not help for Mac OS is available8. Still trying to figure out how to talk to a support representative as they are available only during my working hours or shorter & I have not been able to find an option to leave a message/ email for help.In short - very good product when it works, but support seems to suck. Also, some problem of seller (assuming warranty start date is their issue), published features (switching off - everybody is now lazy to switch off a shared printer/ Manual duplex) do not always work."
1,First of all it's not worthy for the money you pay!! The color prints smurge. The plug is not stable to put in the socket . To print off it asks to install plug-in besides HP smart app.it will take time to print . sometimes it doesn't print at all and the paper comes empty . I just got fooled by the good reviews . Even after the ink dries up it smurge .waste of money
5,Excellent product.  Bought it during Diwali offer...
5,"My Views:LIKE:Faster print than earlier inkjet HP printer, wireless connection is easy to configure.Print quality is good with the speed of Print.Resolution of scan is acceptable.HP smart Print or scan feature is icing on cake.Very good facility of Scan n share with mobile HP smart app.Same day of receipt from Amazon, HP Engineer did Installation ..Great work.Spare Ink bottle would be sufficient for atleast 1.5 years for my printing need.Packing condition of Printer was safe enough..DISLIKE:Manual Duplex: need to feed the paperNot sturdy built quality but ok. Need to keep it safe.Protusion out of Ink tanks from main body of Printer.Conclusion: Recommend to buy"
5,"So,let me give you  true review. Packing by Amazon was awsome. Let me directly tell you about best , best , best feature about this printer 1) wi-fi direct, you can directly take prints wirelesly using smartphone , pc , laptops. No need to use datacable, pen drive etc , this device is completly wire free.Another most most amazing feature is, you can even scan docoments using smartphone, laptop ,pc. Scaned copy will directly be sent to your device wirelesly. Print quality is awsome, and fast."
4,"I am writing a review for HP 419 AIO printer. Package arrived early, installation was quite easy, did it myself.‚Ä¢ Wireless connectivity works well‚Ä¢ It's not that heavy, comes with 2 black bottles and 3 bottles (cyan, magenta, yellow), they were spill resistant, didn't cause a mess‚Ä¢ Got printheads, easy to installOnto print quality‚Ä¢ It's great for text‚Ä¢ Photo prints are alright, if you only want to print photos, I recommend not going for it unless you use high GSM paper‚Ä¢ Scanning & copying is great, works pretty wellOne thing though when it printed out the guide, it said HP 410 printer, so if you want to spend lesser money, go for 410, it's literally the same except for having an extra black bottle that you can purchase for less than the extra amount I had to pay for 419Overall, it's nice. Go for it."
5,"HP printer is very good product.  But the HP dealer/service centre of Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands is not supported for service.  They are shown the HP company letter that if HP printer purchased from online is not covered warranty.  I was purchased HP printer 410 which is warranty period is upto 28 December 2019.  But they are not accepted the warranty and charged for Rs 3000/- (Rupees three thousand only).  So it is my advice to customer don't purchase HP printer.  The warranty period showed the online is making fool to customer.  PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE HP PRINTER"
1,"Lot of instructions and still difficult to install. When I called their helpline, the agent told me I am not supposed to install by myself!!!! Like, how is anybody supposed to know. Once you open the packaging all it says in big font is instructions of how to install. The printer head gets stuck when you connect to power. But why???  And amazon pickup guy canceled thrice. But why???  Overall not a great experience."

1,"Used printer with empty ink bottles and two empty packets of system printhead sent in the box by Appario retail pvt ltd.. The actual parts were missing. There was ink leakage everywhere. Amazon said to wait for HP technician to open the box, we registered nobody came from HP and Amazon is not ready to change the printer though we are a prime customer... AMAZON SUCKS... SO DOES HP..."
5,"After using this printer for a long duration, I'm writing this review.1. Sometimes the paper print was not coming out completely, only half portion is getting printed2. When printing some bulk pages say 10 pages, printing was getting stuck in between and getting hanged up. We need to cancel the job and print the papers one by one3. Color and Black and white print quality was excellent when we select the properties of the printer of the print quality as High before giving a print out"
1,"I purchase this printer for my father office, but since it arrived its not working properly. I setup my father office after 10 days printer arrived so return window closed.So I contact hp support but from there also 2 times enginner comes but nothing works.I got defective product from seller himself so I Would say purchase from offline , you can check other reviews mostly all negative I make mistake so be carefull.whenever I print all pages stuck in printer. I wasted my 13000 Rs Wanted to sell at 5000 also if someone ready. so much tired from this garbage."
1,"It has lots of disadvantages1. Printing speed is very slow, it will take approx. 5MINS to print 10papers2. You can't continuously print 50 or more papers, as it will either show error or stop and start from beginning in-between.3. Printing on both the sides is good on single paper, but if u do on 10 papers it will forget the numbers in-between and start from beginning.4. Photo print is not good on normal A4 paper. Didn't try on photo paper.Advantages1. Scanning and xerox is good2. Easy to set up, but watch video on YouTube if you wanna do yourself. You will also get support from hp.3. Debugging on wireless setup is also good. Provided on hp website.Overall this is over priced and not good printer."
5,Great product and the printing speed is much better than Epson tank printers
1,The printer turned out to be one of the worst products I have purchased from Amazon. It does not connect with the laptop leaving no choice but to download everything on mobile and then print. Further it only prints pdf and does not support other document types.The printer does not support double side printing. The cartridge leaked and now it gets stuck in every print.On top of it HP offers the worst support mostly through bots that are good for nothing.Yours sincerelyA disappointed customer
5,"I got this printer yesterday and it is working as expected. Do not see any issues until now.Also, got two Black Ink bottle along with colors bottle. And black Ink bottles are of 170 ml while the ink tank capacity of the printer is 80 ml. So even after filling the ink tank, I have half of the ink left in the opened bottle and another unopened bottle. So definitely I can do a lot of printing before I need to buy ink bottles."
5,I bought because my sister using it for 1 year and is showing excellent prints and no doubt you can buy it .... and installation done by myself using YouTube videos as I don‚Äôt want to invite an anonimous person from ho for free installation and the installation for this very easy .. just followed the YouTube videos .. and it‚Äôs been working good ... don‚Äôt follow the low reviews just buy it ... and you yourself can install it not a big problem at all ..
4,Overall good only for home use . Inks used are cheaper compared to toner. Easy to install and just need to be carful first time while installing header. The biggest draw back is its take more time to print the colour. secondly be careful to give number of copies while shifting between colour or black/white. Rest good if you can bear with your time.
5,"I am more than satisfied with the product. once installed with guidance mentioned in the user manual, it's all easy to take printouts, when ever you need that, either from your PC or mobile.Now my 7 year kid to find it straight forward to get a print for his school projects."
5,I ordered this printer after tatacliq couldn't deliver after a month . This came within a week of ordering. It's easy to install. You can either refer to the manual provided or you can see installation videos from youtube. Took an hour to install. It's easy to use. Print quality is good. It's WiFi enabled also.
5,"The feedback is after using for 2 weeks. Very good product, easy to install in all the devices, be it laptop or desktop or mobile. The User interface (UI) of the app as well as HP smart is smooth. However, it time lags a few seconds in the mobile app. Print quality, scan quality is equally good. Now the number of pages printed has to be checked to arrive at the per page cost as claimed."
4,"The printer is quite good with relatively fast printing speed and better print quality. It's easy to install if you follow the manual thorougly or watch some YouTube videos and once connected to PC/Mobile app, easy to use too. However, I don't like the fact that the ink storage tank is protuding out of the main body which makes is vulnerable to impacts and, HP's policy about the phone app is absolutely nonsensical I don't see a reason why I need to sign-in with my email in order to print my private documents via my private printer in my own domicile."
5,"Print quality is amazing , a durable product and installation is also easy"
1,This has to be the dumbest piece of machine I have every come across. I have been struggling with this even after weeks of purchasing it. Even I connect the USB cable the HP smart app cannot find the printer. Connecting with wifi worked fine for the first few days. Now it takes many minutes for the printer to come online after I switch it on. Real waste of money!
1,"Printing takes a lot of time. If we insert more papers in the tray it will not print smoothly or the papers not going orderly and getting jam. The worst thing is the photo print quality. I used best quality photo papers, and the prints getting with a light scratch mark. Very disappointed to buy this at this high cost. Better to have a low cost printer. If we try to contact customer service there is only a virtual agent and it can't get our actual issues and can't help us. Very poor service."
1,"Totally harassed to operate the printer, wifi not working properly, both side printing not performing, paper cost raised caused to interrupted printing and damage of papers. searching alternative. very unfortunate. HP make me offended by through this printer."
5,"Printing is so smooth and easy.Color prints (kids school project) were good enough. I haven't tried to take photo printouts yet . Many have complained about paper Jams , let's hope it doesn't happen :).  So far I am loving it for the economical prints and the ease of refilling ink in the ink tanks. I would recommend this printer to others."
5,"I have been using this printer for couple of months now.Installation steps are very easy except pouring the ink that takes time and setting up the cartridges that must be fit in exact slot.Using the printer with laptop, smartphone is extremely easy and it hardly takes a minute to get started.I have tried printing office papers, kid's school cards on 230 paper and works like a charm"
5,"Printer is very good. Quality of printing is very good. If it is black and white print out time is as fast as a laser printer. If color printer, it takes time (less than a minute anyway...)Installing print heads is tough. The manual is not enough to do installation. I watched in youtube to get better understanding of installation.Ink bottles are costly. (you will get 1 set free anyway..) And printer seems to use more ink ...inks are getting vanished faster..!HP smart is very easy to use and great way to use. WiFi options is too good.Overall...go for it...very very good printer in budget."
2,It is 4 days from delivery and HP engineer is not turned up for installation. Service number is 166244.  Need urgent support to get this installed . Then only quality will be rated.
2,"Well...bought this printer as a mistake and totally regret the decision. Print quality is trash duplex printing doesn't work at all and really slow. Overall just a really really bad printer. Please go for Epson or cannon, trust me this has been a waste of 15k rsCustomer service is also bad they take min 30mins to respond and iam not able to get product support for this issue.Really disappointed with hp for this one"
1,This is the most worst product I have seen ever..
5,"Its been more than 8 months after i purchased this printer. I am writing this review after using it. If you are planning to buy a printer that would provide cost effective copies, and a wireless connectivity this is the best choice. This is not recommended for people who use printers ver rarely. This printer should be used atleast once in a week ro avoid issues. The print quality is 90/100 and value for money is 95/100. The number of copies per cartridge (yield) is same as its mentioned product description."
5,Only issue is a print sent to HP Email address. Takes like about 5 minuted for a full page. Very slow. Anything connected on the network or directly with a calble is very good and fast.Dint try printing photos yet... shall try ot soon and update the revire. For now.. i dont see a reason to remove a star off.
1,"Pathetic... I have Neven seen or used such rubbish item in my entire life. This printer does not work properly. You will give some other command it will some other. It is worst while printing on both sides..you please even don't expect from this printer. It does not connect to your gadgets easily, you will have to pull your hair out here. Hundres of my pages go in vain because it does not work properly."
4,"You will have to watch youtube videos to install it perfectly by yourself. But once successfully installed it is a good buy. To register you have to search product no which is inside of front cover lid. Must register the product. While print quality is good , there is no duplex printing, no duplex ID scan (available in bro printer) and no paper tray, which is a drawback."
5,This inktank hp 419 printer is good enough for home use and office use as well. It has a fault when you print many pages such as 20-30 at a time it takes a time gap after printing 10-12pages and automatically print the remaining.  Otherwise this printer is low cost both black and color print.
2,We ordered the printer and it was delivered properly. Installation was done by us as no one from HP called for scheduling installation. The network feature does not work. There is no installation guide on how to use it with HP App or how to set up on office wifi networkPrint quality is OK. Must use regularly else ink chokes the printer nozzle.
2,"Document printing is up to mark.but don't expect pro level photos prints. The biggest issue with this printer is setting up wireless printing (hp 419) .I tried everything I could to set-up wireless printing but failed. I called the customer care and they tried to remote assist and set up the same and they failed. Then they literally said that I have to use USB printing as they are not able to set up wireless printing.So , DON'T BUY THIS WIRELESS SERIES HP PRINTER.  Opt for usb printing or if you really need wireless printing then go for other brands.Such a disappointing experience."
1,"Please do not buy this because  installation local team is very poor,After so many follow up they just came start and go away.I can't able to print and i called them they blocked me."
5,Good product which did the job well
1,very bad quality product. didn't last for 2 days. waste of money.
4,"Product is ok, but our price.....@398"
5,Good product
5,Value for money
1,Abc
1,Poor quality
1,"The printer was purchased on 21 July, 2020 but became defective just after 5 days of installation. We could just print about 20 pages on 2 ocassions within a span of 5 days on receipt and installation. On 3rd time on 04 Aug, 2020, it failed to switch ON and gave error message of system initialize problem. HP service engineer visited to repair it and suspects major problem in internal components but the company has refused to replace the printer, as whole.Item not worth purchasing and I feel let down by the brand name of HP.Example of poor customer care/regard by HP."
1,"It's just a wired printer, not working for e print , google clouds print , apple print . Cheating customers by giving wrong description.Don't buy there are so many other options available with low price"
5,"First reviewed a lot on HP laser printer for home use, purchased this and, fully read the manual, enabling wifi or wireless use for printing and scanning is very simple.  Unless and only if manual is followed in order to configure then only everything becomes easy to use.will update later"
1,"The product is ok. But Amazon has provided partial information about the product. Its a manual duplex printer and not an automatic one. And this information is nowhere mentioned in product description, while all the gazillion other details are there. I found out about it only when my 10 day return/replacement policy on the product expired and AMAZON clearly refused to help me with matter. Neither did they owe it up to their mistake of providing partial information. Will NEVER again order anything expensive from Amazon. Customer care is pretty useless."
5,"Best part : manageable size, acceptable print,scan and Xerox. No Hassel of ink drying if not in use like inkjet. Excellent WiFi connectivity using HP smart App. Recommended when you suddenly need prints /scan and Xerox sometime and no use some time.Not an color printer. Laser color printers are not proven at these price."
5,Great product
5,I use it for home purpose. very easy to use. design is subtle and simple. and i am impressed by brilliant packaging by amazon. i received it in very nice shape. only problem is digital screen is small and has no light in background so it is little bit hard to read. still this printer is amazing.
1,Good evening sir. Instead of laser M1005 model I forgot to by this. Kindly change it as soon as possible sir. Very few days only I used this printer. Kindly take bake and change Lacer M1005 model sir. This is my humble request sie
5,Very easy to install. Has great print quality.Scan quality is also not bad. You just need HP account and an app then you're good to go from any device. Just keep in mind you remove all the packaging even inside the printer next to cartridge. It is plastic n can melt if not removed.
5,"USB & WiFi Direct is working excellent.But when we connect laptop give print, error message will display (use USB). After reinstall of software working fine, but everytime can't do the same. Once switch off & on it will appearing but not able connect laptop with the same WiFi network."
1,waste of money always showing low tonner even after filled also
1,"Sad to write neither Amazon nor HP does bother to help in giving a demo on how to connect and use.Thanks to COVID restrictions , HP is enjoying on poor service."
5,A versatile laser printer at an attractive price point for those who have low to medium printing volumes
5,The product meets the quality and specification of a branded item. Very happy
5,"The Wireless facility and Mobile printing is very useful. Easy to print anything in your mobile like whatsapp documents, photos etc..etc..using HP mobile app. Scanner and copier also useful to reduce our stress"
1,Product is too bad and after purchase their service is too bad
4,Good product for printing and also scanning. nice product but I received only few days . You can also not buy this product.
5,Good Printer... Let's wait to see it's cartridge printing and refilling cost and other maintenance...
1,HP has one of the worst Customer Support. Instead of sending somebody and resolving the issue they have wasted previous Business hours.
4,this printer is amazing easy to used .printing speed os pretty good and sharp print details üëç
1,Hp not any support .. very bad quality printer don't buy hp any product .
3,Printer sims to be good but not that is showing the image.Also not known why the warranty is only for 7 months ?? Please revert on this point ??
4,Overall good no doubt
5,Have had a positive experience with the product. It's quick and neat!
4,Colour print is not availableImprovement needs with apple devicesToner replacement cost is high
3,"Product is ok, but HP support is pathetic, you have to approach several times to get the work done. Not expected this from HP"
2,Toner cartridge dry and not working. So no question of rating a printer. Please supply a functional one immediately.
5,Use very easy
4,Printer cost would have been a little low
5,Nice
5,Great product with indeed a impressive performance.
1,only 300 paper prinoutwifi connectivity is very poor

5,"HP printer works efficietly, it is value for money."
1,Local tonner in the printer. Never buy online.
3,Two side print experience is very bad
5,Perfect scanner...Feeding is  perfect...quiet...fast..duplex is good...cost was bit high ...
5,Great scanner work very smooth. i digitalized my all paper clutter in my room. now my room is neat and clean and nothing lost:-)
5,Superb... very efficient and very compactVFM..great service and customer support by dealer supplier (scanner India)
1,"If it scans 20 pages ,only 3 pages are showing preview and only 3 pages are showing at last .Software issues"
4,Good product for small work places
1,Need to download or install on a device that has a DVD drive!
5,Good product
5,Very Reliable Scanner
1,The scan of papers is extremely bad and replica of the copy is difficult to read. Lots of lines and dots in the soft copy even after trying over multiple copies. Scanner tends to sway from direction of scanning and requires a person to stabilise the paper with another hand so it‚Äôs difficult to use when trying over multiple papers.
2,"I bought one of these, a decade back, in person from a store. It was great. The one that i got from Amazon, when i tested it..it left oil stains all over the papers i tested it on. Even after a 20 tests, the oil din't stop leaking. Clearly, the seller had a defective old one lying around for a long time, just oiled it, packaged it and gave it away to Amazon."
5,Useful product. Good service given by Tobo
2,"Mobile scan or portable scan are same & no difference,but flat scan are best which is not possible with this device."
5,Nice product
5,Nice product
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
1,"I've tried setting this printer up over Wifi and USB cable. Through my Laptop and my smartphone. No matter what you do it won't recognize or detect the printer. It is unusable.Ridiculous for a Rs. 18,999 Printer. Completely useless.Update: Just to give you an idea, to take scans on this printer, it asks you to enable your location (GPS) on your smartphone, and create an account with HP. You have to wonder why. Throughout the setup, it keeps asking for your location. After over an hour of struggle I managed to set it up on my smartphone, but no matter what I do, my laptop cannot use the HP Smart App to connect to this printer regardless of whether I use the Wifi or USB options. If I try to log into the built in web server on the printer, the password I am expected to provide is wrong. This is so ridiculous - because I am connecting to it over USB!!Don't buy this printer! if you must buy one from HP, by a different model. My 10 year old printer works effortlessly, but this is a piece of junk. I didn't have a great impression of HP, but now its hit a new low.Update: part of the problem is there are limited instructions, and some of it is incorrect. This printer says it supports 5Ghz networks but actually it supports only 2.4Ghz. If you are trying to set it up on a 5Ghz network, it will never detect, and won‚Äôt even tell you that is the reason. If setup with the HP app doesn‚Äôt work, just use your built in software. Their app isn‚Äôt needed except for mobile devices,  and I feel they mainly use it to collect data on you üòû"
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"

1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn‚Äôt work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,"I installed the printer today post delivery, realised that the WiFi receptivity is WEAK relative to my earlier printer. Luckily I have 2 WiFi connections at my place, it eventually got connected to the second WiFi Router (the routers are in the next room). The printer has reasonably good Scan and Print quality. This is my preliminary feedback. Will update after few days of working. I have by now tested every feature except FAX in this printer. The SCANs are just beautiful and quite fast. TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY .."
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
3,"Printing quality is good. Printing 2 sides of paper option not able to findScanning feature is not great. When scanning from hp Application on Laptop gives hard time. After  clicking scan button, we need to push paper little bit, how accurate we keep papers before hitting scan button it doesn‚Äôt detect, little move is mandatory after clicking scan button. And scanner is also very slow in scanning papers. Recommend 60% to others."
1,Cartage is too costly.. don't buy
1,Within a month toner low indication. Catridge not available in local market. Original catridge cost around 4.5k. Dont buy. Dont buy. Waste of money
2,"Printer cost is cheap but maintenance cost is higher than other printers. It is not for official purpose , it is used in home for kids project."
1,"Printer cost ‚Çπ17,500. Initial toner was exhausted within 50 print out. New toner is chip type for this model and cost ‚Çπ4500. It's kind of trap from HP to keep chip in Toner. B/W Print/ Xerox  cost ‚Çπ5 per page"
1,"The worst printer that I have ever bought! Right from day 1 issues, service is bad, support is bad. Very truly bad experience. Paper Jam issues, could not print even a single page. Used other printers, never had even a single issue. Don't recommend, stay away from this printer. Utter waste of money, down the drain!"
4,Scanner and all other functions work well. Wifi printing also works well.Duplex printing is not automatic ‚Ä¶ papar needs to be feed again‚Ä¶Paper tray not fully covered. This may cause harm in long run.
3,"Poor build quality. Too much paper jams. I brought it just for the ADF, that works fine. But apart from that the, paper jamming and all its irritating."
5,Not send warranty card
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."
2,HP should have given auto duplex printing in this model. People who are buying beware of it even-though ADF is mentioned in the spec. Such a basic feature is not available.
5,Product is good quality no doubt but some time I face the problem to connect with wifi.
5,Excellent
3,"It does not have automatic duplex as claimed on Amazon site. Also its all features like booklet printing, two sided printing, customised page printing cannot be availed on Mac. Air print just offers basic printing"
1,Please do not buy this printer.  Because when the toner is completely exhausted you have to buy a new one.  Toner is expensive.  This toner is fitted with a chip. New toner is not available in the market to buy
1,I bought a new one but still the printer is printing half prints and tearing the pages I also clean the cartridge several times but still is not working well I bought a month ago hardly I printed 10pages yet
1,Worst printer please don't take
1,The printer doesn't scan its cartridge and giving the same error again and again.This is the condition of a new printer. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,I did not get it my USB cable and all with printerOnly power cable i got it
5,Best and better fingerprint scanner
3,"No rd is registered, i had purchased and the device is not rd registered. Then I have to spend 425 extra for rd. The description is fake"
5,So quick function . i read some reviews about RD service absence. But its not true. I have check its have rd service already enabled. I done 2transaction on digi pay. And all you know digipay not run without rd service. Advised to all please check rd service status on morpho's original site
5,"RD service is pre-installed. Verify from rdserviceonline.com only by providing the serial number(5th digit is ""I"" in capital).I'll recommend using smartphone as the process is much simpler than using computer. You just need to download three apps (morpho rd service,morpho SCL RD SERVICE, main app eg. Jeevan praman). Just connect the device using an OTG adapter (ctype or micro usb) and follow the process."
5,Very good device for authentication through adhaar. Jeevan Praman works with it.My device came in rd services from the seller radium box.But they need to improve packaging quality. A box is to be expected with this delicate device.
5,"I hated the product until I found how to install it properly myself after not getting proper help from the support team, some people at the tech support are worst... They don't respect customers... I wish there should be a feedback system for customer service... Though, one good guy hinted me unknowingly which helped me install the device properly myself...Coming to the device,It's such a gem...Pros:1.Superfast2.Easy installation3. Connects in seconds4.Looks decent5. Drivers are available6. Good support for various sites.7.RD service pre-enabledCons:1.Worst Tech supportIf you have trouble connecting and haven't got good support at technical helpdesk, then ask me I'll help for sure...."
5,Baught it for 2200 only. Easy to install rd service ready product. Ready to use. Working perfectly fine. Very long cable length. Using it for DigiPay Aadhaar printing KYC and Jeevan pramaan services also can be used for UTI Aadhaar Biometric verification for matching PAN card application records
1,This product made me fool. It is fully Loss of money. Various of difficulties come in installation. Please don't buy SAFRAN ICONS MSO1300 E3 BIOMETRIC FINGERPRINT. Mantra and any other companies is more better than this product.
4,Packing was not good but product was safe thank you easy activation  value for money
1,Hello teamRecently i bought your device Morpho Icons- MSO-1300 E3 Biometric Fingerprint Scanner with RD Service & Latest Version. when i am trying to connect to my phone  i am getting error ( No single device registered yet). I have gone through your FAQ and user manual but could not resolve the problem. Please support in this regards. Please not that i am trying to benchmark your product against similar product for Skill India project (Govt. of India initiative) quick support would help me in accessing and finalizing the product for our across India locations
5,"The product works fine. I wasn't sure after reading mixed reviews, however, after ordering it and using it I am satisfied. RD Service (device whitelisting) is valid as advertised. Just make sure you follow instructions properly when installing. Little complex when installing on windows PC easier on android mobile. Check instruction details, download latest driver, software from the Morpho RD service website. First time I also faced issues as I did not follow the steps properly. After following the steps properly its work absolutely fine. Go for it. It has 10 day replacement plan so don't worry."
1,"When i Purchase this device ,there was mention in specifications device is with RD service but whe device is delivered at my home ,I check the device it is not activated and RD service was not Activate."
1,"This is the fake product, there is no brand name written on the product b it is given error every time, I bought this product because in the description and display image product has morpho written on the product."
1,"Got it from glowing 98. Looking at the reviews I was doubtful. But the device I got was already whitelisted (rd service registered.) You need to enable otg for some mobile devices for the device to get detected.Worked with Android mobile, jeevan pramaan was generated in less than 5 minutes. Happy with overall experience , specially during this pandemic situation.The cabel is thin, so have to be a bit careful when using the device. Fingerprint scanning is fast.Morpho is not written on top left morpho and idemia are kind of same. Idemia is parent company of Morpho and india manufacturer is smart chip pvt ltd. UP.Glowing 98 did not respond to any questions about the product before , so they can improve in customer support.If you are in doubt , just go for it and see by yourself. If rd service is not registered , you can buy it from rdserviceonline for 375rs. (May take few days to register)The device I got was already whitelisted without any expiry."
5,very good product
3,"installed the device downloading driver from morpho rd service. however, I had to register it by paying rs 442.5 for one year. Initially telecheck was successful but after some time it went on giving message telecheck unsuccessful. I uninstalled it and reinstalled. problem resolved. Submitted life certificate successfully. Device worked perfect. The supplier could have included a manual to describe the procedure for its installation. Specially to inform about need for inclusion of path by editing environment variable."
4,Good Product with 1Yr RD.. Satisfied..But I received it by small plastic cover.Requesting you to send this product by small plastic or small box.. Packing is not a safe one for this electronic device...
2,"No packaging box for the product. It was inside a zipper pack and which was too not sealed. No user manual, no warranty card. No paper inside the packet. I can't trust the authenticity."
4,Yes I get free 1 year RD registration  but I'm not get OTG cable which always with in.
5,Had purchased it for father's Jeevan praman life certificate finger scanning. You tube & Jeevan praman site are to be utilised for its installation ( which is not that easy if not properly followed). Worked well post installation for the desired purpose. Purchase worth its value.
5,"The installation on windows platform was a bit tedious and showed device not ready. However, the inrerface on android mobile worked flawlessly and in one go. Hats off! Purchased it for jeevan praman - life certificate submission (required for continued pension) of my mother during pandemic.Only 2 apps need to be installed on android phones  1) morpho rd online services app from playstore 2) 1) jeevan praman app for android via download link received from jeevan praman website. Follow the steps in the jeevan praman app manual and you are good to go."

5,Very nice
1,"Morpho device name missing on device, and is it original device, packing is very bad, no box, long time delivered. So west of time"
1,The product does not support higher end version (7 and up)of Android version. Add to it a total lackadaisical approach and response from idmei team. I have a query pending since Oct 2019 and they are unable to provide a response.I would not recommend anyone to buy this product with my experience on customer support from their end.
5,Used it for Life Certificate. Very good option at this crucial n difficult Corona time..Submitted life certificate from home it self no need to go to bank.
5,Device Works perfectly on jeevan pramaan mob app for generating life certificate. Very good initiative by modi government for retired senior citizens. Also takes off load from banks. RD services are enabled for device.
1,Its works but api not provided
5,"I‚Äôm using it for my mother‚Äôs online pension verification, so that we need not go to bank once in a year for the same. It‚Äôs really wonderful."
1,"Product detail indicates that the device is ready with R D service but, after paid ‚Çπ4190 I m feeling cheated because now I will have to buy RD service. No RD service given as mentioned in product detail"
5,I had to register the device at no extra cost. It worked perfectly and I was able to submit my mother's blive certificate.
4,Seller could provide the drivers and some basic information. There‚Äôs no indication of its status at any point other than the time it is actually scanning. That‚Äôs very confusing.
5,Installation is tricky. You need to search online for latest drivers. Once installed it works fine. It reads fingerprint quickly and clearly. It comes with rd service. Used it for jeevan praman for my father. Super useful during this period. Very grateful to this device.
5,I used this for Jeevan  Pramaan. Generated the certificate from my android phone in minutes.I installed Umang  and Morpho RD service applications and followed the instructions.
5,It's product is very good rd service activat no any problems very fast scan
4,"White-listing to be done before delivering the product to avoid inconvenience to the customer, as per the description in the website.After contacting the seller, device was white-listed. Seller was helpful in resolving the issue.I have used this device to update details on Jeevan Praman and it worked well."
1,"Fake product, Serial number not verified , not registered in RD Service. Feel it's fake product . Without box packing . Without manual . It's fake product. Please do not buy. No customer care number."
4,product doesn't carry RD service feewe have to shell out ‚Çπ442 .50 to use it for online purposes including jivan praman
3,"Finger Print Scanner is handy but without manufacturer logo. Item is from Indemia, reads finger easily. Installation without manual is difficult for common man. Manual not supplied.Rd Service not activated as stated, I had to pay Rs.442/- extra for one year."
5,The product met all my needs it was easy to install .I just followed the setup guidelines by watching you tube tutorial videos so if you are purchasing this product for whatever use please check online on YouTube for setup Tutorials
1,"this is a complete waste, worst product from the seller, They should have test first before selling"
3,"After using the printer for a few days, here is what I experienced:Pros:1. Unboxing and Setup was easy and quick2. Printing was fairly simple3. Black print is fast and crispCons:1. Downloading the driver was a terrible experience. The HP Website was so slow, I could finished my lunch, evening snacks and it was still downloading!2. Colour print is absolutely worst. Highly pixlated and no sharpness even after selecting best quality in the settings.3. Printed a picture of my nephew on a photo paper and after 24 hours, it hadn't dried and got smudged when touched and spoilt the whole print.Conclusion: if you are looking for home printing and if 90% of it is B&W, its an excellent printer. Its good if you wish to print color text too. However, one of the worst printer for color photo printing. I wish I had purchased Epson Ink Tank printer!"
2,Doesn't support wifi connectivity wrong details in comparison section. Only usb connectivity.
4,I am giving 4 star due to HP support staff. I bought one printer with Amazon. Item deliver on time but product is defected. I replace the item receivd another printer. Now working properly. But HP support staff said that it was PC software problem for colour defect. Not proper support from them. But Amazon deliver on time. Thank you so much
1,I am an expert in ITand this product is just garbage. When I calibrate the print heads it does not take place and prints are all distorted and of poor quality. Tried to get a replacement the same day but amazon is not letting me do so. Everytime it takes me to consult an expert and the support person repeatedly asks the same questions again and again and finally they ask to contact HP. Total waste of my money. Just a landfill now.
4,"The printer is okay till now. It came with two sealed HP cartidges- black and tricolour; four bottles of sealed HP inks, one power cord, one USB cable and a polythene cover.USB cable is smaller than the earlier versions like GT 5800 series ( smaller the USB cable, faster the connection). Installlation of cartidges is some tricky. You have to carefully remove the orange clamps by rotating the lever in arrow direction.There is no installation CD. You have to download it from HP site.In the first day, printing may not be good. It will take time for ink system to fill the cartidges.Earlier I used GT 5810, it is same to same except some minor variation.Overall the printer is good for photo print xerox, scan etc."
1,Print head error after 30 prints and 2 weeks. 3 visits to HP service center and now they want me to buy print heads as the print head which came with printer is out of warranty. Printer is under warranty.
1,"This product made in China you can expect worst quality by default,black and white print is okay. Color print is very bad. Scanning is normal. Good bye HP I am not buying your printers,scanners any more."
5,Delivered and got installed by HP team in one day.It's looking good and all functionals are decent.Even print quality is commandable.One concern I read was on the size constraints but I felt it's pretty ok.It's only occupying quarter of my study tableOverall good buy as I bought with discount for 9.9 k.
4,This product HP 315 Ink Tank Printer is a decent printer for home use. Color Scanning and Printing takes 4-5 minutes for a single print sent from a Laptop via HP Smart Desktop App. Direct Scan and Print takes 1-2 minutes. Print quality is good for the price of Rs.9400. Ensure that you have done proper printer settings for good quality print. Not recommended for Business use as it is slightly slow (almost all non-laser printers are slow only). The received product was already registered for warranty a month before I received this product. I hope the 'Appario Retail' seller has not scammed me as to who else could have registered the product a month before the customer. There is no Wifi on this model which may be a concern for some. But you can always convert such USB-based printers to wifi printers using TP-Link routers.  Overall I would rate this product as the perfect printer for home use.
1,"Print Quality is pathetic, used superior quality paper. 40% of print outs either getting stuck inside printer or torned."
4,"Print quality is very good, printer installation is very easy, but software installation takes time.Printer is latest but the drivers needed for scanner function is a later version. Few extra steps needed for full functions. Other wise very easy."
4,Print quality is not the best but good for home use. Printing speed is little slow. Installation is easy.
5,"Print quality is as expected, nice u may say, its a large Pinter, consumes space.HP Services though slow was nice.Thanks to service engineer who came to install the printer, as he replaced the faulty colour print head supplied with the Printer."
5,Print quality is good. It easy to install and repack. To some extent value for money.
4,"The prints are OK for both color and BW. They are not awesome but decent. It's a line printer, each print will take around 10-15 secs."
5,"No doubt, printer is good and prints good. The packaging was also great and satisfied with it, but there was no Amazon sticker in/on the product.And the most important thing there was no Invoice/Bill, which is always present for any small-to-small product.Satisfied by printer and highly recommends it."
3,"Color prints are not of best quality, can't produce orginal vibrant colors, always very dark, otherwise works fine."
5,"Printer is very good and fast, very economical to use. Can print from mobile also with otg cable. Print from mobile is slow but from pc very fast. Easy to use and scanning and copy also good."
5,"I love all the features of this. If you are looking for a nice printer for home use, it is good to go."
5,Printer is really good with nice options in the HP Smart App.
1,Yet to get installation support. BUY ONLY IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ENGINEER HANDY FOR INSTALLATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE REMOTE. GOOD FOR TECHNICAL CUSTOMERS.
5,Since I started working from home and my child also online school printer became essential for us. This printer is very easy to install and use. Also this gives good quality of print. It also used for scan and copy. So overall nice performance and worth putting money on it.
5,I struggled a bit during installation of the printer...
5,Nice printer. Easy to install and take printouts.

1,"Guys, if you are serious about this priner, pls read this first.I am using for last 6 months and with original toner i printed around 1200 copies where company is saying 5000 copies. You can also search google review before buying this.The dual toner cost is 1400 and you can print 1200 copies.If i can get 4000 copies, that is adjustable.  I am thinking to go to consumer court regarding this."
5,Must for engineering  students who are fed up with collecting notes and printout for internalsIt may help you in a right waySo it is worth buying
1,HP calls it NEVER STOP PRINTER but its not true. Purchased in Sept 2021 from authorised dealer in Goa it has stopped working twice. First just after 7 days of purchase and now just before one month of use. First compalint was attended by service center after 6 days. Full drum unit was changed. now the printer .has stopped working completely. touchpad not working. service center is on holiday for navaratri. Didnt expect this from HP.

5,"HP 319 ink tank printer review -1. Purchased for 9700 Rs during Prime day sales2. Delivery was done next day of order.3. Installation process is quick and easy. Many YouTube videos available. Can ho through.4. Print Quality is Excellent and great.5. Scanner is very fast. Scans and prints within 20 sec for B&W and 40 sec for Colour6. Printing speed is ok. 7-8 Prints for B&w per min and 3-4 Prints for Colour.7. You will receive 2 Black ink bottles of 170 ml each which will print minimum 8000 pages of b&w practically which is very decent. Tricolor bottles of 80 ml each will print upto 3000 - 3500 colour pages of decent quality.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 310 or 315??Because it has 2 ink bottles of 170 ml plus blue design. 310 and 315 has only 1 bottle Rest everything is same in all 3.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 410,415 or 419???319 does not have Wifi whereas 410,415 and 419 has wifi and you can print from mobile and will cost you minimum 3000 compared with 319. I dont have any use of Mobile printing and hence opted for 319. If you want to buy Wifi Printer, go for HP 419 as it is top model and 2 ink bottles of black with it as in case of 319.Why not Epson, Canon or Brother ????I liked the design and sturdiness of HP Printer and there were negative reviews and feedbacks about these 3.So i hope my review will be one stop guide for all of you.Thank You üòä"
1,Service provided by HP is very poor .don't buy this product .I bought this printer 319 ink tank just 15 days back I have got a printer with damaged color print head .HP  company is neither replacing my print head nor providing service ...I feel am betrayed by Amazon and HP company am planning to sue them I won't leave them that easily
5,Great product I love it very much. Cost saving easy handling WIFI printings gives a hassle free operation from mobile devices or from your computer/laptop even you can create a unique email id with HP and send email like FAX on this printer from anywhere in the world and it gets printed.
5,First of all thanks to Amazon to gave me a quick delivery..This printer is1.Easy to handle2.Easy to install3.light weight and reasonable size4.Easy to print and scan5.Printing speed &Wireless connection Printing is low .Totally Am happy with this advance HP419 model printer.
3,"I am using it frim past 1 year.After 1 year Printer Head will stop working i.e. immediately when warrenty ends.U have to buy a new one of Rs.3500/-.Also you need to take printouts with a regular interval not more than 7 days, otherwise Printer's head will also stops working."
4,"I am using HP 5811 for more than 2.5 years. Now I am using this HP319 from August,2020. Print Quality is same. The problem comes after a few days with Black Prints as mostly we all take black prints more than color. Still, it is surely value for money!! You can use it 2 and half years / 23000 pages yield which comes first. More I can say, It is much better than Epson Tank Printers, which I used earlier."
4,"Good things:- Looks great!- Build quality is great- Input and output tray folds inside the printer. So you can cover it up properly when not using. There is a cover to protect the input tray when the paper is not kept, this is very useful to prevent dust and particles going inside.- Spill free ink refilling- Good quality print. Photo prints are good too. But this is almost similar to cheaper inkjet printers.- Installation process is not that difficult- Makes less noise and vibration while printing- Scan and copy speed is very good.- Claimed page yield and per page cost is very less. Should be a very economical printer.Bad things:- Black print head started showing error the next day. I called HP support, they assigned the call to the local support partner who came and replaced the head in the next working day. (I called them Saturday and they came on Monday). I didn't wanted to raise replace or return to Amazon as the replacement printer could get some issue too. Overall I'm happy with the support. This is a good thing but the fault is under the bad things list.- Print quality is like any other inkjet printer, nothing special (at this price point). If you need the best quality black prints, go for laser printer. Not a bad thing but I just want to set your expectation.- The driver and main printing software called ""HP Smart"" is only available through Windows Store. In one of my laptop the Windows Store is not downloading the app (not sure what is the issue, I tried tons of troubleshooting steps but none of them worked). From HP support portal you can download basic driver and printer software but the experience will not be the same as the HP Smart.- Ink Tank printers are expensive. This is similar to any Officejet printer with an additional tank and ink flow mechanism till the print head. Wireless models are too expensive, Rs. 3k extra. I wanted to buy the wireless one but paying 3k is not worth it. If you are someone who use computer all the time there is no point of buying wireless one. You can easily connect the printer with USB cable and print. Wireless printers have mobile printing feature which can be useful for some people but not for me.Recommended things:- Use good quality paper. Cheap papers can result in ink bloating at the edges of the lines or texts.- Keep the printer covered properly, save it from dusts.- Use the printer regularly. These kind of printers are not recommended to be kept at home without using it for long time. The print head, ink pipes etc. will get dry and you need to spend on maintenance.- Use HP original inks, those are not too expensive."
4,Light weight.. easy to use .. perfect for personal use.. print clarity is awesome.. only one issue it doesn't have a software installation cd. If you are unable to download the hp smart app in ur pc follow the instructions by support. Hp. Com
4,"The printer seems to be good, easy to install and quality of print is also good. It has been a month of usage, and so far no issues.I had purchased it for 10.5K in May 2021 and installation was done based on video shared in WhatsApp by technical support team. I am able to take printout via OTG connected to Android phone as well. It also works with windows laptop connected via USB, I am yet to try with Mac laptop. I am regularly using it as ink tank printers have to be used regularly on daily/weekly basis.Pls go through your current & future needs and based on that purchase the correct type of printer - inkjet /advantage, ink tank or laser"
2,"Initially Installation was a problem. The Guide given alongwith the Printer is wrong so wasted lot of time in installation.Whenever giving print command, after 7-8 pages of print, paper gets stuck. After pulling paper out, printer does not give remaining prints. So has to give print command again for remaining pages.Many times gives blank paper in between."
5,Really useful Printer forlow cost printing.It does not take too much time while you are doing print text/documents whatever may in Color or Grayscale.For this thanks to Amazon and Seller and off course delivery agent for their wonderful job.
4,"As per first use it's easy to install and quality of print is good, see after more use how the product is responding and the performance.I got 2 blank ink 170 ml and 3 color ink 70 ml but the printer whire is very short hardly 1 mt it should be 2 mt minimum. I not happy üò¢ with printer usb cable very short rest all is good.Thnks hp and amzone delivered the product on time."
3,"It this range , printer should have at least 10 pages tray.. what is the point in putting each time putting single paper .. I take 8-10 prints every day but every time I need to stand near printer to put single sheet üòü"
5,"It‚Äôs a wifi printer, No duplex scan, you need to perform scan manually.Ink tank printer, clean print quality, value for the money.I was confused with Epson,but HP 419 has a small screen to give info regarding the print.Best for home or office usage."
5,"I'm writing this review after 1 month of usage. I'm a Property Lawyer and have to prepare lots of bonds, deeds and other legal instruments apart from this profession, I'm a photographer by Hobby. So I was looking for a Printer that can print office documents as well as sharp photos and after so much research I bought this. Fully satisfied with the product. The difference between 319 and 310 model is that with 319 you will get two bottles of black ink that will serve you for 1.5years while with 310 you will get only one bottle."
2,Poor print quality for photos. I purchased one week before and was very eager to print passport size photos and other photos at home. It disappointed me unconditionally. All my room decorating plans with photos collapsed. Please go for epson or canon than chossing hp
2,Colour print is not fulfilled expectations { money waisted } and less printing size options are available  . For color printing it is talking time  in between you can go and take one cup of tea in same time. Very Bad experience I had after 6 months please don‚Äôt waist your money
4,The product is good. But at first driver was not installed from Windows store. In that case you have to download and install driver manually from the hp website. Next point is Pathetic quality in phtocopy resolution is too poor in this case. Default scan resolution is also 200 dpi. If you want to sacn in 300/600 dpi you have to change the settings every time. Print quality is superb. I am missing my canon mg 3670 for auto duplex printing.
4,"The printer is really good as per my initial impression. Very easy to install and use. Talking about the features - A4 size printing and photostate, color printing quality is good and printing output time is very minimumal (approx 5 to 15 seconds. Just one thing is missing on this price range which is WiFi printing as one always need to plug in USB with printer on Laptop/Desktop."
3,Cons1) Prints 3-4 pages in a minute.2) Scanning a page at High resolution takes almost 3-5 minutes.3) Copier is also slow.Go for Epson wireless instead.
4,Overall satisfied..... Good product... looks wise very cool ... light weight.... easy to fill ink and easy to install printheads ..... but if u are not tech friendly or have no knowledge of PCs laptops then it could be difficult for u to download and install software and its drivers.... though tge guidelines are very clearly mentioned in guidebook.... now coming to print quality its ok ok... if u are using it for small scale purpose then i would recommend but if u gonna use it for printing photos then the quality is ok type... rest budget wise review i will update after using for sometime...
2,"think 100 time before you place the order online.  I brought this product, later I realized that this product has no wifi connectivity. I understand that it's not there in the product description.  I tried to get it replaced with the model with wifi but replacement is allowed only when product is damaged."
2,If someone buy this product. it prints is good. but its head ink supply pipe is many times gets air bubbles and facing irritated .be careful bought this product.ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
5,I like HP printer .printing quality is very good nd easy to install ..but this not a good quality photo printer .scanning is also good .
4,"After the usage of 3 months I nearly printed 700 pages, ink tank of the black colour reduced to half,I doubt that company can meet any near of their claim of 15000 B/W prints.It is quite possible that they are having the claim of 75 dpi print while 300 is very good.If you are printing in 600 dpi then it will use a lot.1200 dpi print takes very long to print I observed around 5 mins for 1 print."
1,This printer was mentioned as wireless. On installation it was found to be USB. Scanner is not user friendly. On the whole I am very unhappy .
3,"Printer head problem , in two years I hv replace it two times."
1,I searched for Wifi printers. This printer came up as result. I ordered. On receipt I found that this printer is not wifi capable. So disappointing! üò¢üò¢
3,"Everything is Ok with the Printer, except for PDF documents. It does not open up directly. We need to go through Adobe. This printing service was available after HP rectified it online."
4,This is my 3rd printer from HP over last 20+ years. This one was easy to setup and use. The printing quality is good and works very well.
5,"Very good buy. Didn't get any discount,thats the sadest part.Print quality very good. Since July I have been taking at least 10 pages every week and could not detect depletion in ink level."
5,Easy to setup.Scanning and copying is good ;printing is a little slow but good quality of printouts.Arrived earlier than expected so Yay for Amazon!
5,"le lo bhaiyon, saste waale se zyada peace of mind rhega (na ink cartridge khareedne ki jhanjhat na hi ink sukhne ka darr).. 1.7 saal se ink hi khatam nhi ho rhi iski aur abhi bhi ek bottle black ki bachi hai. I am preparing for Upsc so printing acchi khaasi ho jaati hai 1200 approx pgs print ho chuke hain till date."
2,"print quality good and paper feeder take 5 to 10 sheets ata a time. also no wifi ,not value for  oney,its a shame to hp"
1,dont take printer papers not taken print worest printer hp in world
5,It is a good product. You have to follow instructions to install it yourself else call installation service. I was able to do it myself. Print quality is good and can give a lot of prints based on volume of ink provided.
3,"There are 2 main problems1) Connecting wire from printer to computer/ lap top is very small, should be minimum double then what is given.Co should send bigger one to us as it is making lot of problem.2) Receipt given with printer is not clear, Should send new clear receipt"
1,Printer needs to replace colur printouts are not coming and Amazon refused to replace
3,"The supplier has not provided the installation CD apart the printer is good, but without cd installation sucks....print is good n print is performing upto the mark"
2,Text smudges away when highlighted.. Photo paper print left ink marks on my hands even after 24 hours.

5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ‚Çπ3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,"At this price you cannot get anything better. For those who are complaining about the cartridge life, please NOTE THAT THE INCLUDED CARTRIDGE IS A STARTUP CARTRIDGE WITH ONLY 20% INK. Please buy a standard cartridge and you will achieve your dream number of pages... Also its a home printer so do not expect a print speed of 1000 pages per minute. Overall very good investment. I do recommend.It was also received with all HP original Seals. So many thanks to the seller for sending an brand new piece."
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,"I had a problem with this defective product. The customer care was difficult in returns and replacement. High value products should be returned with no hassles. That is how Amazon US and UK or any other country functions. Amazon customer care was very hesitant. The product description had 20 pages per min for BW and 5 pages per min color prints, but it would take 5 mins to print a black and white page with a simple letter. I was not even able to print an amazon bill. The color print never worked. Amazon agreed to a replacement. The replacement arrived and I tried to print a simple BW document and it didn't print at all. The replacement never worked at all. Amazon took the replacement back with a lot of very difficulty after sending video evidences and multiple photos of their useless product. Never buy this model. I have a HP Inkadvantage 310 series and it works like butter, fast and easy to use. Never by printers with cost less than Rs5000 from HP. They sell outdate hardware."
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it‚Äôs not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don‚Äôt cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from üò∑ u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
3,Appario Retail Private Ltd did not respond to email. Wrong product serial number were mentioned in invoice because of that I could not get HP redemption. It is very bad that Appario Retail Private Ltd  did not respond to emails and willingly mentioned wrong product serial  number so that I could not get redemption from hp. Neither HP nor amazon have no corrective measures.
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
2,HiI am here to tell u about the printer i brought first i tell u cons there are many consCONS : 1)THERE IS NO OPTION FOR COPIES LIKE IF I KEEP 1 PAPER IN SCANNER AND I WANT 10 COPIES AT A TIME BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO PRINT 10 COPIES AT A TIME2) THE PAPER IS STRUCKING IN BETWEEN RODS WHILE PRINTING.3) LAST BUT NOT LEAST  THE INK CARTRIDGE IS SO EXPENSIVE 700 PER 1 BLACK INK CARTRIDGE AND 700 PER TRI COLOR CARTRIDGE AND WHEN WE PRINT UPTO 20 PAGES WITH BLACK OR TRI COLOUR INK WILL BE COMPLETED WITH WHAT INK U PRINTED . THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INK SHOULD BE VERY CHEAP BUT HERE INK IS VERY EXPENSIVE.4) NO WIFI AVAILABLE5)WE CANNOT CONNECT MOBILE SO MUCH TIME WITH OTH CABLEPROS :  PRINTER IS BUDGET FRIENDLY FOR HOME BUT INK IS VERY HIGH...PLEASE DONT BUY THIS......HOPE YOU READ THIS REVIEW.THANK YOU.
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
1,The printer doesn't include Cartridge. then i saw the bwlo saying customer also ordered comp pack. then i have ordered cartridge as well. finally there was no BW cartridge only color came and ordered again BW and waiting for delivery. its frustrating ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not good approach. be clear in your add and provide the right suggestion to customer.also . the printer box was delivered at the opened condition. its was not factory packaged. printer was not even covered properly insde‚Ä¶.im not at happy with this deal.
1,"It does not work. It prints pages in parts and then stops - or does not print at all. Have to press the black or colour button repeatedly to make it start. And whatever printing it does is done at a pace slower than a snail on a relaxed outing!! And printing is accompanied by disturbing noise line by line. the whole unit is tinny, like a child's toy - only gives no pleasure.I have never complained of an Amazon product. Could you please advise where do I go from here. How does one lodge a complaint? How to return the printer? (I am ordering another one from you.)Thanks and regards."
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
1,"After a lot of trial and error by me as well as by the technician from HP, finally the conclusion was drawn that this printer is not compatible with MacOS. Weirdly, this is not mentioned anywhere in Amazon detail page and HP has kept this fact hidden in some safe vaults which I failed to discover."
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
1,I received the HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 2338 model today. I have tried many times to connect my printer with the laptop through usb and using HP smart app. It is not detecting my printer. I even tried to do the same with other laptop still not working. I think I need to replace this product.
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
1,"Not sure if they know what are they building.The printer model says 2338, it is not detected by the driver software on windows 10, m1 mac.Tried returning, disappointed."
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,"Very expensive print, not working with ink refill, every time I have to change cartridge that cost 1600, and it have to be changed after 200 print"
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
1,"The scanner was delivered to me on 14th June 2020 after paying more than Rs.24,000/-. Today on the 26th July 2020 scanner was required for some urgent work, therefore I tried installing and using it, but in spite of many efforts, I failed to install the scanner.I called the CANON helpline, they asked for some number from the machine which I conveyed to them here comes the shock, I was told by the person on the other side that product which was delivered to me about 12 days is already out of warranty.So is canon cheating us in connivance with Amazon?buyers please, be-aware of fraud which may be happening on Amazon. Better be safe than sorry."
4,"I think DR-C225II  is better than the DR-C225 scanner. It can support longer sheets. The speed of the scanneris very good. The eCopy PDF Pro License key was provided, and only the driver CD. It took a day to figure out fromwhich link on the Canon site one needs to download the ecopy Pro software and the CardIRIRS software. Canon does apoor job on their web site w.r.t support. Calling Canon India support, responded immediately, but they had never heard the name of this software or how to install it. Finally the Canon link was located / provided by the seller.  Thesoftware works great.  Conversion to editable PDF, and exporting PDF files to word for editing are also great.One can scan BW, or colour. It scan both sides. Speed is great. Good for archiving all  old important documents, thatone can now discard after scanning (years of documents for tax purposes , etc !) .  While it is for A4 size, it can scanlonger documents. Only the width is constrained. If you setup the FOLIO option, and fold the wider document, thescanner will stitch the front and the back into a single page. Amazing. (you need to fold is right and make sure the paper does not skew one way. .Installation was fine on Windows 10 Pro x64 bit. I had read of numerous issues faced by others, however it was so straightforward that it installed in now time with no fuss.  It took a while to understand the scanner and thecapture software. Overall I think its a great scanner, and easy to operate."
5,This is the best scanner used by me so far. Speed is good. Scanned 600 pages in 1 hr approx. Comes with CD of drivers. Operating software is easy to use. Provided to me with invoice but when I called canon india they said out of warranty. On telling date of purchase they said ok show invoice when required. Comes with a licence key of eCopy Pro Pdf 6 free but can't find the link to download software. But performance of scanner is overall 10 pointer. I wish if some one could tell me from where to download Ecopy pdf pro office 6.
5,Total Value For Money and wonderful easy to use features
1,"Scanner is good, but its warranty is already expired when i contacted canon, is my scanner is used?? Please dont buy from scanner india seller.... Already two comments on the priduct having expired warranty ,same happened with me..."

5,I bought this cable to connect to my laptop cooling pad. Works fine so far. Cable length is also sufficiently good.
5,Good product with satisfied price value
2,Cable material is stiff. Would not straighten. Ordered it for an old hard disk; it was not detected using this cable.
3,The power output on this cable is quite less compared to some others. Solves the purpose though.
1,sadly the cable does not work for my portable hard disk....the item has malfunction...sad....

3,good
5,"SV600 is the best option if someone is looking to scan books.It can scan into different formats such as JPEG, PDF, searchable PDF, Word, Excel, and Power Point.The operating time can be shortened by turning on the ‚ÄúAutomatic Page Turn Detection‚Äù or setting a time interval after which SV600 will automatically continue to scan.It scans anything from Business cards to A3 size document.If there are multiple documents placed simultaneously, it automatically crops and saves each of the documents separately."

1,"Dear sir, your portable scanner not working. Unable to install the software. Kindly replace another item. Very urgent. I want to take classes using scanned documents. Kindly help as soon as possible. Like same item your igate projector also not working properly. Unable to read the projections. Quality very bad.. V. Kalaiselvi lecturer,  registration training Institute, royapettiah, chennai"
5,Price plzz
4,Bought for Rs.2099.00. Print quality is good. Low cost printer. Cartridge ink quantity is low. Best used with a CISS(Ink tank) as shown in photos.
4,"The delivery was really good and fast and it came in a proper package. Nothing was damaged. I really like the printer because it has great print quality and is easy to use..Not much complicated.But the cartridges in the packing are canon pg745s and pg746s which are small size..I have taken 11-12 colour prints and now the indicator is saying that the colour cartridge is finishing. So I am really disappointed by that. But overall its a really good product.This was my first printer so I like it very much. The total prints I took are 55 n now its saying tht the cartridges r empty..PS. U can take 5-10 prins even aftr it says the cartridge is empty!Tips- Buying new cartridges every time is going to be really expensive. I have had the printer for like 8-9 months now, so if you are looking for a cheap option buy good quality ink and just refill the cartridge! It works wonders!"
1,"A most unreliable printer. One is never sure whether it will just go ahead and print/scan or come up with a number of excuses.Keeps on giving Low Ink warnings when there is plenty of ink left in the cartridge. Prints hardly 25 pages on a set of new cartridges. The built-in adapter makes sure that the whole machine goes kaput in case of a power surge, because you cannot replace only the adapter."
1,"noisy, returened after purchase."
1,"Very very very worst experience with this canon printer I had this is my 2nd time to buy and return this product it has used cartridges, without CD no warranty card nothing.open product full of dust and fingerprints are clearly seen on this product such a bad experience this printers has given"
1,"The packaging was superb, the delivery was smooth and the order arrived very fast.  The only problem was the product was defective.  So I sent it back and got a replacement.  That was also defective.  So had to return that also!!! What more need I write about the quality of the product?"
2,"You have to buy a cartridge every time, which almost cost 25% of the printer pricing every time for a single cartridge. It is better to buy an ink flow printer rather than cartridge-based printers"
5,one of the Best printer right there in  Market if u are gonna be under 2500 RsBest for home usageand Photo Copy and Scan is Too fluentDont believe in FAKE REVIEW just buy it without any thought‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èCartrige Refils are also cheap and Good than The HP oneBETTER TO GO WITH THIS THAN HP deskJet 2131üëçüèª
2,Print quality I like but packaging and moc wasn't so good
4,"Pros : 1. Prints are great2. You can print in 'High' Quality3. Scanner is great for home use.4. You can modify it to tank printer if you are tech-savyyy.5. It can print a card also, ie. visiting card or else. Obviously you should not expect to print Masonite Board.6. It works fine with local printer color also.  You can find it in amazon.7. It is so easy to use as xerox, my granny now using it.8. Canon software support always great.Cons : 1. You can not do 'Fine' print.2. In each size of page 1.5cm will be blank. You cannot avoid it whatever you can try with software and page size.3. Larger than A4 cannot print.4. Obviously printing color-consumption is high, it is Inkjet.You can buy it if you want to use it in home only."
4,"Honest Review- I have been using this printer (MG2570s) for a couple of months. The print quality is good. This printer mainly focus for home purpose so dont expect much. Printing speed is bit slow that too if that is a colour print it will consume lot of time and you need to note one thing is that it will not Print from top to bottom tip of any page, itll always leave 10% space in the bottom of the page not sure why it cant print the bottom end of any page . so if you're going to print anything from top to bottom end of paper make sure u resize it.Coming to the Ink deatils, i used the stock ink which was good. but that will run out way quickly if you print in High Quality. If you want to buy a genuine ink that'll cost around ‚Çπ800-‚Çπ900 for small catridge both color and black. Alternatively you can fill using local Ink to it (hope you have seen some YouTube videos) but the printer will always indicate that its running out of ink even if u fill ink in your catridge. Cannon will force you to buy a new Catridge at on point.Scanner is a plus. scans image/docs without any issues.Overall i would say its an OK product. make sure u download the proper driver from website has a bunch of tools will be available for photo printing, if you're looking for low cost home printer definitely go for this."
1,Very bad fine Cartridge.... Change cartridge...loss of many
1,This is not printing anything when it enter paper in it comes nothing is printing on the paper
5,"Value for money. I've been using the same type in my home country. You get a black and colour cartridge inside the box as well, so no need to buy the cartridges separately, however I added my purchase with each black and colour cartridge for backup. I'm using it for my son's school task and to scan/copying personal files"
5,"loving the quality of the printer...recommended... u can go for it... cons- size of the cartridge is too small for professional users.. but we can hav a rectification for that too... so without any hesitation u can go for it....just buy this and use from ur hand... don""t go through any reviews..it beats the quality of epson higher end models literally...."
5,THE THING I DIDN'T LIKE THE MOST THAT I DIDN'T USE THIS PRINTER MORE THAN 1 MONTH BUT THE PRINTER'S CARTIDGE IS BEEN DAMAGED AND NOT WORKING PROPERLY.AND I AM ALSO HAVING 1 YEAR WARRNTY OF THIS PRODUCT(PRINTER). SO I AM PLEASE REQUESTING YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR MY PRODUCT EITHER CHANGE IT OR REPAIR IT.
4,Fulfill my requirement
5,"Dear friends,After buying this printer cartridge cost goes high So,  you can refill your ink cartridges with the help of YOUTUBE.  All over printer is too good.Thank you."
2,"Print quality is average, it is typically hard to use an inkjet printer like this. My bad experience goes to value for money as the printer which I received, was damaged and non working. First, I decided to return but then I thought to complain in customer care. An engineer came up in my shop, did something and it starts working.Dear Amazon, please complete a proper quality check before you packs the products for the customer like me so that the customers like me, could leave some positive feedback.Thanking you,"
1,"Dear Guys don‚Äôt get cheated by buying this product. Don‚Äôt see any of the other comments, my personal feedback worst printer I ever had. I took maximum 10 sheets print and the cartridge emptied. You will be spending all your money for buying catridge. Don‚Äôt buy this kind of cheap product at all , I missed the opportunity of return, due to COVID I open the box after 5 days..."
4,"Good product with budget price. Compact and lightweight. Only issue is The cartridge, company provides 2 cartridges in the box which are 245s and 246s. These are Small capacity cartridges and do not last for more days."
3,Ink consumption is very high  one full Cartagena unable to print 20 copies colour.30 copy of b&w.
5,"It would be good to mention that the capacity of the ink cartridge is low - can only print about 60 pages, after which a new black cartridge costing approx Rs 650/= is needed. Buying a colour and a black cartridge will set you back by about Rs 1,150/="
2,"Even though printer is reasonable, it catridges cost half of the printer's price. And the main thing is, if someone is buying for occasional use please don't buy inkjet printers. It will get damaged if it not printing daily."
5,One of the cheapest printers available in the market and it's worth every penny. The scanner works very well and the print quality is also decent. The software is also pretty swift and easy to use. Cartridges last longer than HP printers. Overall a must buy !
1,Most worst product I used just twice or thrice and it's stop working. Don't waste money on this product
4,Print quality is good for home usage. Setup was easy but take a long time. Latest laptops don't have cd reader so drivers need to be downloaded from website. Once setup it's easy to use.One negative feedback is for seller. They sent used ink cartridge instead of new one. Black ink was empty even before driver installation
1,Printer is defective it is not working not giving any print one light of power on/off is blinking others are not quality is very bad not liking other that that black ink cartridge is not working it is dry not giving any ink i m very dissappointed with this product not expecting this from amazon kindly return it
1,Don't fall for the affordable price of the product. The cartridges are too expensive to buy and they last very little. All videos related to refilling the cartridges also don't work. At least none worked in my case.
1,"I have ordered this product but found this printer is not detectable in my laptop . Later I have figured out it's a problem with the printer hardware data cable port but everything is fine with my laptop . Such a sheer waste of time , effort and money."
1,This is a waste printer.I hardly took 8 pages  and then the both cartridges (black and colour) were finished. A cartridge costs around 600 INR and it only lasts for about 7 to 9 prints. I don't know why canon is selling such a worst product. I request you not to buy this product.
4,Print quality is good (not recommended for people with studio profession).Original ink cartridge cost way too much so one should refill them manually with substitute ink.
3,THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD TILL THE CATRIDGE IN IT BUT AFTER CATRIDGE ISOVER THEN REST OF FEATURES DIDNOT WORK AND ALWAYS ASKING TO CHANGE THE CATRIDGE EVEN TO SCAN. SO I SAY NOT TO PREFER THI TO BUY ONLY TRY TO PREFER INKTANK PRINTERS
2,Printer cost is cheap compared to other.print quality is good.but the major disadvantage is the cartridge gets empty within 20 A4 size prints company should look into it when they claim that the cartridge last for 100pages also the cartridge prices are expensive
1,My cartridge ran dry after printing only around five pages. Replacement costs around Rs. 500. Canon should withdraw this printer from the market.
3,"After printing 35 pages it gives black ink warning. But in product details, it is mentioned that with one cartridge of ink you can print 200 pages."
5,Excellent product meets all requirements q zzz
1,"Total waste of money as I got fully damaged box in rain and broken parts in printer inside. Evidences of Repackaging done and seems used product as product is full of dust. Warranty card, product book are torn."
1,Terrible experience. Not getting installed itself. I had bought an HP printer which was very easy to install - started working as soon as I plugged it in. I feel cheated on purchasing this canon product. Useless product.
5,Printer is good but catrige ink is showing half i have taken 20black print only
5,Portable scanner. Works well
5,The packing was very good. The scanner works fine. The product and quality is also very good. Works faster than all my scanners. I hope it continues to work like this in future as well.
2,"Scanner's Feeder is not detected the papers, so i had to return it. If the documents are old, then rollers of feeder have to clean very frequent (in after a single scanning)"
5,Excellent
5,up to the expected standard. quality product and features as advertised. Little expensive though in comparison to other available products
5,"nice product, I like it"
5,Excellent product t
5,awesome product
5,Best Product in its class.
2,"Delivered seal opened product, these days I am seeing these type issues with amazon"
1,Not even a cardboard box for 15k worth product? Could not even imagine of it's journey from Kolkata to South India. Almost the top was open which was stick with home cello tape like one.  Highly disappointed for this careless attitude. Need to test if the printer is really new and still working!!!Note: Few moments later I notice that the warranty was activated last month itself when checked in HP website. That unfolds the story.
4,Overall it was an easy self installation and the print quality and print speed is as expected and solve the purpose for home use. The WiFi direct setup was done easily and prints well but the setup for WIFi with router is documented as simple 2 lines step but somehow is not working properly and need some better detailing.HP certainly wins my bet ahead of Epson and Canon after all my initial research.
4,"516 is good printer with good quality prints and WiFi printing is a breeze using iOS.The build quality could have been better, paper inlet tray is flimsy and the outlet tray is very small hence papers fly out of the tray after printing.Overall printing is goodBuild quality is below mark compared to epson printers."
1,Multiple follow up for installation but there is no sucess.The technician assigned is super busy and never call you back. I  afraid how can they support when there is an issue in the printer.. Poor support
2,"Think before buying.. I feel like I have wasted alot of money on this product. The print quality is best. The product is nice. But I feel like the description is misleading, it will not print more than 500 black and white pages for the ink provided by the company. Please don't buy it if you print less than 50 pages a month. You will be wasting alot of money on such unnecessary product."
3,"I researched and finalised this product because of Hp brand over other brand products which are available with better quality and less price. It does the job to print with all features mentioned, print quality is average. Total 6 ink(3 different colours and 3 black bottles) is plus point. Works well with HP mobile app( note additional hp plugin app required other than main HP print app). Print quality not good even at best setting. Brother and epson mention better quality on paper.HP support was good, got installation person visit on same day after asking on hp request link.I am personally disappointed with hardware build quality of this product as top scan cover is too filmsy, not sure how long it will last.There are other better product from brother, canon available but not sure about their services.I called/mailed hp support to get warranty start date corrected.Overall, ok product and not value for money with rating 2.5/ 5PS: rejected first product as delivery box damaged and second product was replacement after multiple requests on customer. Amazon disappointed there."
5,Recently bought hp smart tank 516 printer. Built quality is quite good. You get very simple instruction manual very easy to follow. Filling the ink tanks to printing was very easy. After downloading the application n connecting with printer via wifi was quite good. Took some document prints as well as photo print on photo paper. Both were good. So far impressive. Need to see how much print can be taken with the given ink.
4,"Printer & scanner quality is good enough. But it does not have a stable WiFi connection. Everytime it goes to sleep mode, it disconnects.Another problem is -- it has no option to connect to a hidden wifi network (if you've hidden your SSID)."
5,"The printers comes with the ink tank integrated, which reduces the footprint of the device. The printers are compact and are designed to fit better in homes. The HP Smart Tank comes packed with ink supplies in the box that are said to give an output of a minimum of 6000 pages (black) and 8000 pages (colour) and are said to be 38% faster. The printers can be connected to mobile via dual-band Wi-Fi and HP Smart mobile print app and Bluetooth LE."
2,"The print quality is OK, installation was a breeze..After using it for 3 months, I feel frustrated, As the printer is not as per my expectations.First of all I cannot load more than 1 sheet, If I put more than 1 sheet the printer gets struck.So you end up losing lot of time loading the papers.If you want to print only one sheet, then it takes quite lot of time (2 to 3minutes to take in the paper).Overall I'm not at all happy with this product. I regret buying this printer..."
2,"If you ever need a printer which is difficult to install, difficult to get the proper settings, slow to start up, slow to print out, creates one issue or another after every page you print with either paper mismatch /printer busy info and a host of other issues which you have to trouble shoot everytime after you print a page, then you have FOUND the perfect product. I am stuck with it. Want someone else to also suffer this torture!"
1,"Even company rejected my previous Review, so reposting again. The print speed as claimed us false ink head type printer can never be so fast. Lower build quality, suitable only for students or small quantity work. Shall not buy again, I returned it"
1,"Have called HP and they spend a couple of hours remotely and they re-install too much software but were not able fix it.  When the HP support team conclude the call he said will get back to you in few hours. After 2 days also no action from HP. I am using HP Computer, laptop and printer but still same OEM products are not working and the support team is not able to solve. So guys think 100 times before buying HP Products. HP support request no #5070827688"
1,"I Ordered this product on 3rd Oct 2021 and received after 2 days and i requested for installation in HP.After one day i got call from HP engineer and he came for installation. He opened the box and after primary setup he tried to connect the power supply and first time only got some noise inside head and loud and E03 error displayed.Very Vey unstaisfied, First time i am experiencing this in AMAZON...Attached HP Engineers updated in the pack.Please don't go for this product, it is my personal view."
1,"Although HP has a big brand name but it‚Äôs product quality as well as customer service is pathetic. From the very first day, the paper was getting jammed inside the printer, for which I first tried to contact their whatsapp customer support, which was completely useless. First a chatbot will ask all the details and will hand over to some representative, then he will ask you all details over again. Then after wasting 15-20 minutes like that, he will just give you address of some service centre and tell you to take your machine their for repair. You will keep wondering if that‚Äôs a solution! Service centre will not pick your call. Customer care number will put you an infinite time killing loop, after waiting for half an hour, you ultimately will disconnect, and just curse yourself for buying that product!"
1,You will waste lots of time in doing setup. Every time you try taking print some or other problems comes. It does not recognise print commands. It‚Äôs nightmare taking print on this . Please go for some other brand. HP does not even send a person for installation. You will keep on wondering what happened why it‚Äôs not printing.
1,"Worst product, got used product. When i check the warranty status its showing start date of 12 Sept 2021 but i got this product delivered to me on 5 October 21"
4,"Very good quality prints & copier, truely more number of copies compared to normal inkjet printers. For document scanning more options for sharpness or dpi would have helped. Installation & setup was a bit time consuming. Worth purchasing this printer in Smart Tank category."
1,"There is a issue with black printhead, cant take any prints. After raised complaint there is no response from HP service. Fake information of 6 hrs installation and service in amazon site. My money wasted."
5,Everything was perfect except packaging...I received opened packet/box of printer though nothing was missing so didn't made any complaint.
5,This was a replacement. Previously an used and dameged one was delivered.Very easy to install and set up..hardly took 8/10 mins to set up. Wireless set up was very easy.
5,nice quality
4,I'm using this printer for more than a month now. Hp sent their service engineer to install the printer. I use this wirelessly with my Android phone and Ubuntu laptop. I'm satisfied with this purchase so far.
3,"Overall the printer is worth buying as it is very very economical, moreover wire free/ wireless printing is an added advantage.Cons: the black ink when printer on photo paper/ glossy paper tends to smudge even after several hours/ days. Doesn‚Äôt seem to dry."
1,Not connecting to wifi
1,"Promised installation within 6 hrs , 24 hrs gone no one contacted even after logged the complain 2 times ."
4,Only one issue i found using this for one week. If we connect directly with our mobile Wi-Fi the printout gets struck in between.. This happens when printout is taken more than 7 pages. I cannot take 10 pages continuously.. other than that this a very good product for home.
1,"Very difficult to install WiFiStruggling , there is hardly anything in the manual"
5,Used for 2 weeks .. took photos and document prints
4,"Over all good quality product, elegant, easy to use, dilent, smooth"
4,"Printing quality is good, easy installation, no need to download hp smart app. Just use WiFi direct to print documents/photos from your phone."
5,Easy seamless printing from anywhere! Worth!
5,"Its a nice product. Purchased it for some personal work which requires a finger print authentication. Very easy to install (took only 5 minutes) and use.- Its able to capture the print quickly and without any issues.- For Windows 7: Its plug n play and For windows 10, drivers can be downloaded from there website.-  Comes with a OTG cable (Not USB type C).- It can be used with mobile also. Android app can be downloaded ( Link is provided on there company website).- Can be used for aadhar/kyc/pension validation.- Built quality is also good.- 1 year warranty."
3,It's not up to my expectations as the OTG cable does not meet my requirements. I had expected c type cable but on opening the box I found the OTG cable is not c type. So I could not use it instantly.
5,The scanner is easy to install and use with Jeevan Pramaan software downloaded from Jeevan Pramaan website. Follow the instructions after downloading booklet.Thank you.

1,Worst product. Software does not support.
5,"Performance is excellent, but it's adjustible stand is loose that affects hight adjustment."
1,Damaged product supply
4,"Portable cordless printer/scanner by canon are very useful. The problem is with canon company itself, the stop software upgrade and suddenly you find your precious gadget is useless. I have one and now useless"
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
5,Works really well
1,SD card missing. So unable to test it. What should U do. Should I return it back or SD card will b provided.
4,Really very helpful for teaching and result is very great.Only thing is software is not as per expectations or compared to hardware.lt should be more advanced with and should be upgraded especially annotations part.
2,Poort Support and drivers
1,Very bad product..never buy it
5,Great product
4,"smart product in field of education, but pictures appear not much clear in 2 MP camera"
5,Good product and very useful for book scanning easy to install and use in this lowest price. & best camera quality.
1,Image quality is poor and software provided is not up to the mark. Also support from the company is not good
1,"Didnt had the updated software  and very less support, quality of Image is not very good ."
3,"Have been using the product for a week now. Some important observations are as under:- The product looks are appealing but build quality is very low. The plastic used seems very weak and fragile. The printer is light weight but at the same time 'delicate'. The upper glass flatbed cover is so thin that i could barely hold it prevent it from breaking.- The installation is easy. Wifi connectivity is also not a problem. Have a broadband connection at home and was able to connect all my devices through the home network.- Cartridges are not very expensive but at the same time they are small and nit likely to last long. Better to have a spare set in hand.- Print quality is average. Not very great but satisfies daily use home requirements.- Printer is slow and bit noisy when the cartridges move. Not much of a problem.The biggest advantage is that you can print from anywhere in your home without physically connecting cable.All in all a good budget printer for home use. But if you are looking for some extraordinary results and features, look for something else."
3,"Writing review after 3 weeks of usage. Was easy to set up. Canon's service number and email mentioned here did not work so has to call Amazon customer care and they give a new number. Installation was scheduled in a day but I managed to do it before canon's engineer visit using steps mentioned on net.Disappointed by ink capacity. Coloured ink cartridge is already at 40% level after 20 print outs. And, black at 70% level. Faced paper jam issue as well.Will update review after few days."
1,"The printer is good for homeuse and should not cost more than Rs. 7000. Canon website has listed this for Rs. 6885 but seller Computronics Multivision has listed this for Rs. 9200 as on Aug 18 2020.When product was delivered, even the MRP was scratched out."
4,"1. Product Delivery: Rating 5 - product was delivered 1 day ahead of scheduled delivery date. Good job Amazon.2. Product Build Quality: Rating 3.5 - product is a little fragile and needs careful handling. Could have been better.3. Print Quality: Rating 4 - noiseless smooth printing/scanning/copying. Quality of print is good enough for both B&W/Colour. ***Have only tried WiFi printing & scanning from mobile using canon app. Works seamlessly like a charm. Good value for price range.4. Ink Cartridge setup: Rating 3.5 - Had a little bit of trouble inserting the black ink cartridge. Took multiple tries and some time. Could be a little frustrating for some users.5. WiFi Setup: Rating 5 - This is the best of all. Was able to setup within 5 minutes. No hassles & works wonderfully well.*** WiFi setup is best if you have a WiFi router already setup at your place. Please review my images as I have a WiFi router at home connecting my Android TV, laptop, mobile all on the same network.***Overall this printer is a great option for home and small office users.*"""""
5,Quick printing. Very good for home use.
1,"Useless. On opening the carton I found none of the security tapes in place. This aroused my suspicion. And I was correct. A defective non-functional machine had been sent. However, Amazon arranged for immediate pick-up and cancellation of order. Thanks to Amazon."
1,It was nowhere mentioned that installation charges are extra. Seller is not transparent in his dealing. This is atrocious. Amazon should take note of this and give directions to sellers to be transparent mentioning clearly the extra charges to be paid by the buyer. Now canon is demanding Rs. 650 for installation. This could be so simple as plug and play also. But we cannot take chances in this type of cartridges as Seller or Canon may say warranty is not applicable as installation wasn't done by authorised person.
4,"The built quality of the printer is really good. It is easy to set up and has a wifi connectivity option which I might say should be defacto for all printers. Coming to printing quality it's just average. Does the job, do not expect professional printing results. If so look for other printers, this one is not for you.Printing speed is slow and a bit noisy when compared with others. If you want the working cost per print then for B/W it's 2rs avg and color is 12rs avg."
5,Good quality printing with compact size.Easy to install.Economical printing.Can easily print from any android phone.Better than hp printer in printing cost.
5,Good and affordable printer for normal office use . The print quality is decent enough and I have faced no connectivity issues yet ; as most of my printing is from from my phone it serves my purpose well enough . Using it in my office for last two months without any complain . If you want a good wireless printer then I suggest you go for it .
1,"One of the worst printer ever.... I have hardly taken 2-3 prints and there is this orange light flashing on the printer, which means there is cartridge issue..Within 15 days I have to buy a new cartridge costing Rs 700 for black ink... If still the issue will not be solved I have to purchase a colour cartridge for Rs 1500.00Please don't buy canon printer anytime.. all the printers of canon are pathetic.."
5,"It is a little bigger than I expected. Installation was easy, the steps were quite clear.Only 2 wifi bar is displayed although the router is nearby, but that doesn't affect the printing or scanning. Overall it seems good, but have used it only for a couple of days now."
4,"Prin quality is OK.. connect this printer with mobile/PC by tap the mobile button of printer & open your pc/mobile wifi & print directly, it works like hotspot.. Nice feature..till now it's working well.. Let's see ahead.."
4,Its value for money and good one to use....easy installation and worth
4,So far good after a week purchased. Will update later about more.
5,Good printer and quality of printing is also good.Consumption of ink yet to calculate
5,Printer is good....U can go for it!
4,"Scan quality is great but print not so perfect but good,maybe due to ink quality.Overall the printer does the job."
1,Printer was fine until all of a sudden it doesn't power on.  Worked for about 6 months.
5,Good quality as expected. Packaging was also good.
5,"Cost of Refill is the only worry. Otherwise the printer, quality and working all seems ok..."
5,"Especially with the video guides, It's extremely easy to set up the printer and connect it with the phone and pc. I am very satisfied with the print quality. The printing speed is good in this price range."
5,a very reliable easy to use piece of kit
5,Very Nice
3,I have just took 15-20 colour prints and ink cartridge light has started blink on printer. So it means we can only take 15-20 colour prints with one cartridge.
5,The product is good in use and with good Wi-fi But installation is somewhat Hard
1,Both cartridges had been removed and taken from package.
5,Easy to install and access the item
4,The printer is very well connected with WIFI + has good value for money. Build quality is nice. Its just that the B/W print could be better. Its very dull.
5,Superb quality and economical .Everyone who has low printing jobs must purchase.Amazon service always good
4,Easy to install. Useful for home use and school projects
3,"I think the paper feeding tray position to be even better, because it some times fails to pick the paper automatically"
1,"Print quality is not good at all, ink gets used very quick and printing process is very slow. There is no sharpness in print"
4,Very useful if you want to check OMR sheet. Use only for commercial purpose like schools and cyber cafe.
1,"Not compatible with Mac, does not have any software or driver for mac machines. Totally useless for me."
5,Great product. Very easy to install and use.. Delivered 3 days in advance. Great support from seller.Thank you Nisarga Information TechnologyThank you Murali(The person who I contacted)
5,Superb...
5,Useful and a great product
3,Not a quality good also no option bellow 100 dpi many thing missing also slow scanning.... Not recommended thanks
5,Awesome
1,I want to bevgiven 0 rating not usefull in commercial purposes. Third class scan system. Not smart control system in there.No implementation in scanner
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,Easy to use and printing well. Since this is an inkjet printer and I know I'll be sulking down sooner for the cartridge/ink.But at the end it was my deliberate decision as my printing need is only 5-10 pages a week.So I am not much worried on that side...as I have researched that ink tables are are useful only when the printing requirement is between 300-500 pages a months. So for my usage this one is suitable. And I am happy with the purchase.I have not printed on glossy paper yet to check the photo quality but colour printing on the A4 is also pretty good so far
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
3,I dont even know what is the meaning of ink advantage in here.yeah it gets the job done.But beware if using HP software to print cause the software has developed in the manner to quickly end your ink.All the maintenance (print clean and print allignment)program uses a lots of ink.Go for hp 2331 and save money.So i bought thinking ink advantage but its just not worth trusting.
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
1,"Waste of money.I had used HP inkjet printer for 5 years, and bought this as replacement. But was in for a shock!Setting up the printer was extremely difficult.I tried exchange for a different HP printer. But that is not supportedNow, in less than an year, the black cartridge has completely dried. The colour one is still working.This experience is going to lead me away from all HP products."
3,Colour print show ios 150 page print but i not print 100 page of colour print and cartage colur alert and print not completely colour gradingOnly black cartage is value for money  to usedEvery time 850‚Çπ colour cartage is very costly so buy ink tank printer
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
3,It's print quality is good. It's very easy to use. But the problem is it's colour cartridge is running out of ink too fast. We only took a few colour prints for testing it's quality and functions. But the ink level is already below the halfway mark. And I don't think it will be able to deliver the number of copies in colour as mentioned by the manufacturer. Same is the case of black ink. Though it's level is slightly better than colour ink. Still I feel it will also deliver less number of copies as mentioned by the manufacturer.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
1,If only i could give it a negative rating. I bought it as its cheaper and seemed apt for minimal use at home. The cartridge stopped working after first use itself and now I am only able to print Black and White. I have to remove the color cartridge every time before operating otherwise print wont work. Don't buy this!
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
4,"Its good in terms of quality and value for money.I printed around 300 A4 in black and white and maybe 50 in color before ink was finished.While color ink was finished even though you expect it to print in B&W - it was printing in some yellowish color, I had to remove color cartridge to print proper B&W - HP should fix this."
4,Its a very good printer. Good quality print. However 1 drawback is the installation guide is very poor and I had to rely on google to get it installed and configure. Let us see how long it will work
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
4,Cable quality OK. But it's not compatible for hp410.
5,Very good product and fast scanning. Great thing is that you can connect directly to LAN and use it from any computer on the LAN. No need to connect the scanner directly via USB.Technical support from Kairee is very good
5,"Speed, Accuracy, Clarity, Classification, Requirements and üíØ% satisfaction!"
3,toner kit price very high
1,Full load in printer but still printer ink level is indicating low....
1,Half fill cartrage only gets about 300 prints.
2,The Ink was Genuine and the process of refilling is way to easy and clean.But the cost factor is way toooo huge in one refill only 340 pages are printed that too on having prints on 2 level out of 5.The per page costs comes to somewhere around 2.3 rupees which is way too huge against other printers with the same Price Range
1,"When refilling the HP printer cartridge after delivery Which shows the point of ink, It was less than half and while the other Curtej was refilling, the point remained the same No increase in ink points was refilled before it showed the same amount.This meant that the second refill was empty and the first was also half. So help me in this matter. Here is a photo of the current refilling ink point after refilling both toner."
1,The initial cartridge received with the printer lasted four months. And the replacement purchased here lasted two weeks. As if it was empty. Either the seller is cheating or the product was defective
5,"This product was good, easy to reload, no mesh at all, print quality also good but the price is little bit higher compare with other brand."
4,I feel little bit risky and hard to fill the ink.Packaging was excellent.Super ink quality.Go for it.
1,Costly and fraude Hp reason company promise upto 5k but really upto 2k
1,"This is a lie.after refilling 1toner it prints maximum 600 pages while it claims to print approximately 2500 pages,this is a scam,do not buy hp 1200a printer & this toner.I m using it,they just make fool of customers."
